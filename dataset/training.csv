"the observable universe is in the phase of accelerated expansion presumably driven by dark energy carrying negative pressure p < , positive energy density > and the state parameter w = p/ < . among various candidates of dark energy, the phantom energy is the most esoteric one as it violates the weak and null energy conditions. the recent astrophysical data suggests that w = + . if phantom energy does exist, than its energy density will increase with time and scale factor will go to innity in a nite time causing the event known as big rip which is a sort of future singularity. brevik et al proposed that the cosmic uid will undergo a turbulent phase under extreme cosmic expansion . there exists at present quite a big number of studies on this kind of future singularity, also with the inclusion of viscosity and even of turbulence. some references to the big rip literature are given in . another, and milder, variant of the future singularity is called the little rip. then the future singularity is in principle reached, but the universe needs an innite amount of time to reach the limit w = some references to the little rip can be found in . the evolution of black holes in a dark energy dominated universe is an active direction of research . in particular near the future rip singularity, it is expected that black holes will also go under ripping apart i.e. evapo- rating much like hawking radiation culminating in a naked singularity . this entails the violation of cosmic censorship conjecture itself. we wish to investigate the rate of change of mass of the black hole by taking the effective approach. as it will turn out, the accretion of mass becomes negative in the phantom uid; the black hole mass m diminishes to zero in a nite time ts, the same time as for the occurrence of the big rip itself . the turbulent phase, of course, is connected with viscosity. usually, in a cosmological context one limits oneself to the bulk viscosity only, because of the assumed spatial isotropy of the cosmic uid. in the late universe, however, in the phantom era in the vicinity of the future singularity, one must expect that the reynolds number can be very high and so the shear viscosity becomes dominant at a local scale. this implies naturally the transition to a turbulent epoch, which we will assume to be isotropic. typically, in high-reynolds number isotropic turbulence there exists an inertial subrange in which the spectral distribution of energy is known, e = /k/, where is the kolmogorov constant and the mean energy dissipation per unit time and unit mass. when k becomes as large as the inverse kolmogorov length, k / with the kinematic viscosity, the uid enters into the dissipative region. we will formulate simple assumptions for the turbulent phase below. when considering the accretion rate dm/dt for a black hole in the phantom universe, it is in our opinion natural to put this rate proportional to the sum of the effective energy density and effective pressure. based upon this fundamental assumption, we nd that the mass decreases, as mentioned, going to the limit m = in a nite time. detailed calculations on this case are presented in section ii. we also consider briey other options, for the strength of the turbulent uid component, and for the form of dm/dt. for the sake of comparison, we make in section iii some comments also on black holes in the early universe. also in that case it has been found that negative mass accretion can occur, although then due to the interaction with a scalar eld.","The observable universe is undergoing accelerated expansion due to dark energy with negative pressure and positive energy density. Phantom energy, a type of dark energy that violates energy conditions, may lead to a future singularity known as the Big Rip. The evolution of cosmic fluid under extreme expansion and the behavior of black holes in a dark energy-dominated universe are active research areas. Near the future singularity, black holes are expected to diminish and potentially form naked singularities. The turbulent phase in the late universe, specifically in the phantom era, may lead to a transition to isotropic turbulence due to high Reynolds numbers. The accretion rate of black holes in the phantom universe leads to mass decrease, potentially reaching zero in a finite time. The study considers the impact of turbulence on black hole evolution and explores various options for the turbulent fluid component."
"before embarking on the case of turbulent uids, let us make some comments on the use of laminar viscous uid models in cosmology. the introduction of a bulk viscosity was made a long time ago, a classic reference being the paper of weinberg . the topic has later attracted considerable interest; a recent review can be found, for instance, in ref. . assuming for simplicity a one-component uid, with the equation of state of the conventional form p = w, with w a constant. if the uid is in the phantom region, w is less than it has turned out that the following phenomenological formula for the density-dependent bulk viscosity, =   , with a xed , is useful for comparison with experiments. here we assume for deniteness that subscript zero refers to the present time, t = in view of the experiments one can conclude shown that = / is most likely an optimal choice for the exponent . in that case it moreover turns out that the analytic expression for the redshift-dependent hubble parameter becomes quite simple, h = h p b/h, where = , = c , b = here c = h is the critical density . we will consider the transition to a state where part of the effective energy density eexists in the form of an isotropic turbulent uid. thus e= + t . we let the onset of turbulence occur at the time t = the inuence from turbulence may be divided roughly into two classes: moderate, or strong, turbulence. moderate turbulence. assume, as in ref. , that t is proportional to , as well as to the scalar expansion . calling the proportionality constant , we thus have t = = h, and so e = . similarly we write he effective pressure as pe= p+ pt , where p = w as above for the laminar part, and pt = wt t with wt another constant, in principle different from w. for simplicity we will however set the two thermodynamic constants equal, wt = w, so that the effective pressure takes the form pe = w, analogous to the energy equation . the governing equations are : h = , h = , h + h = w this system of equations is easy to solve. we dene as = + w, and insert a generalized ansatz for the turbulent energy density, t = hn, with n an integer. then we obtain the equation ( h + h) = , which has the solutions h =  /n , h = t c , where c is a constant of integration. as the hubble parameter cannot be negative, the solution h is non-physical unless < that de sitter-like solution is physically unreasonable, however, because it would imply the turbulent part of the energy to be negative. we therefore focus on the solution h in the following, calling it h. the corresponding scale factor becomes a = az/, z = + ht, implying that h = h z . consequently, the sum of effective energy density and pressure is e + pe = h z to track the evolution of black hole mass in turbulent phase, we has to establish an accretion equation. the form of such an equation is not evident beforehand, in view of the insufcient knowledge about the phantom universe. a mild restriction, which we shall adopt henceforth, is to take the accretion rate dm/dt to be proportional to m through some time-dependent function that we shall call f, dm dt = m f. the proportionality to m comes from integration of the radial ux over the whole area of the black hole; cf. refs. . we consider the mass accretion to be quasi-static. there are two options for the choice of f that appear natural: we make take f to be proportional to the sum of the effective energy density and pressure; or we may take it to be proportional to the effective density only. we will now outline what are the consequences of these options. a. assume f proportional to we will rst assume that e and pe act on the same level, and write f = a = ae, where a is an unspecied constant. this assumption is of course simple, but it seems to conform with the same role played by energy density and pressure in general relativity. (compare, for instance, with the energy conservation equation + h = in standard notation.) thus dm dt = am h z , which means that the mass decreases in the phantom domain ( < the solution is m = mz ahm + z . the mass decreases to zero in a nite time ts, where ts = ||h . the turbulence parameter does not occur in these expressions; this is a consequence of the ansatz which involves the effective quantities e and pe only. thus, at t = ts, both h = ||, e = h = , and pe = we, diverge. these are characteristic properties for the big rip singularity. notice the contrast with the little rip singularity in which an innite time is needed to reach innity (for a classication of future singularities, see ref. ). what is the time dependence of the laminar energy density component ? from the denition equation we obtain = || + ||, which shows that the singularity of is only of order of /. it is thus weaker than that of e. for the mass itself we get m || a, t ts, showing that the behavior is just linear in near the big rip. this behavior is inuenced solely by the phantom uid and is not related to any hawking radiation. let us make an estimate of the magnitude of the rip time, taking as an example = . then, with h = km s mpc = s, we get ts gyr, which is a typical magnitude for the rip time. strong turbulence. instead of assuming the turbulent component in the uid to be moderate, as represented by eqs. and , we will now explore the consequences of a more strong assumption, namely to let e and pe be attributed to the hubble parameter only, without any reference to the laminar uid component at all. that means physically that the turbulence is taken to be the overwhelming factor in the late phantom uid. without changing the symbol in the formalism, we may thus write the effective quantities as e = h, pe = wh. in this case the friedmann equations yield h = , h + = this implies that = . the occurrence of the phantom-divide equation of state thus follows from the assumption about turbulence, and is not a condition imposed initially by hand. the universe will develop in a de sitter phase where the hubble parameter is completely determined by the parameter . the scale factor develops as a = aet. as e + pe = in this case, the mass of the black hole will stay constant, m = m the effective energy pressure and pressure become in this case e = , pe = w the uid is completely dominated by the turbulence parameter . b. assume f proportional to e as mentioned above, this is also an option that is worth investigating. instead of eq. we now get dm dt = am h z . starting again from the value m = m at t = , it is convenient to write the solution as m m = ah mt t/ts . with ts still the rip time as given by eq. . the behavior of this expression is complicated. the mass increases with respect to t, and reaches the limit m at a nite time t = tg, where tg = ts + ah mts . thus tg < ts, so the limit m occurs before the rip time. where does this accretion of energy come from? the only plausible explanation is that it is extracted from the phantom uid itself. however, the kind of behavior shown by eq. is after all strange, and we conclude that the basic assumption is less physical than that of the previous subsection.","The section discusses the modeling of turbulent fluids and the incorporation of bulk viscosity in cosmology. It introduces a density-dependent bulk viscosity formula and describes the transition to a state with isotropic turbulent fluid. The governing equations are derived and solutions are obtained for the turbulent energy density and pressure. The evolution of black hole mass in the turbulent phase is explored through an accretion equation. Two scenarios are considered: one where the mass decreases leading to a big rip singularity, and another where the mass increases due to energy extraction from the phantom fluid. The implications of strong turbulence on the late phantom fluid are also examined."
"for the sake of comparison, let us briey review some characteristics of the theory of black hole evaporation in the early universe. in that case, it is known that dm dt =   m rad, , where rad is the radiation energy density far outside a schwarzschild black hole (cf., for instance, refs. ). this result follows in turn from the capture cross section for photons coming from innity, phot = m /. this form is thus different from the basic form that we assumed above for the late universe. continuing with the early universe, at inationary stages rad = h = t , since h = /. thus dm dt =   m t , with here t = referring to the big bang. we may integrate eq. , starting from an initial time t = t, to get m = m +    m  t t . thus m = m at t = t, while m increases with time and approaches a nite value when t . it is moreover worthwhile to notice that the negative accretion of mass is found also in the early universe theory. thus rodrigues and saa considered the evolution of the mass of schwarzschild black holes in the presence of a nonminimally coupled scalar eld, and found that any black hole with initial mass m will disappear due to the accretion of the scalar eld. this was found to hold true even in the absence of hawking radiation. the point we wish to emphasize here is that negative accretion can place both in the early, and in the late, universe, although via different mechanisms. in the case considered in ref. , the disappearance of the black hole would require an innite amount of time.","In the early universe, the theory of black hole evaporation involved the equation dm/dt = m*rad, where rad is the radiation energy density outside a Schwarzschild black hole. This differs from the equation assumed for the late universe. In the early universe, at inflationary stages, rad = H = t, where H = Hubble constant and t refers to the big bang. Negative accretion of mass was found in early universe theory, with black holes disappearing due to the accretion of a nonminimally coupled scalar field. This negative accretion phenomenon occurs in both early and late universes through different mechanisms."
"the concept of viscosity has attracted considerable attention in modern cosmology. for a homogeneous uid with energy density , the bulk viscosity with the constant preferably equal to /, turns out to a very useful ansatz, as far as one can judge on the basis of experimental information . it corresponds to a hubble parameter h that is given by eq. above, as function of the redshift. the main objective of the present work was however to abandon the assumption about a homogeneous cosmic uid and allow for an isotropic turbulence component. we focused on the late universe, assuming that the equation of state parameter w is constant and less than this means a phantom uid. a natural approach is to write the effective energy density e as a sum of two components, one laminar component and one turbulent component t , where the latter is taken to be proportional to the hubble parameter, t = h with a positive constant induced by the turbulence. the expression for e is given in eq. . the corresponding effective pressure is written as pe = we. this is the same model as we introduced earlier, in ref. . it corresponds to a moderate degree of turbulence. based upon these assumptions, we found by use of the friedmann equations that the scale factor a diverges at a nite rip time ts; cf. eq. . this is characteristic for the big rip singularity. we went on to examine the accretion of mass of a black hole in the phantom universe, starting from an initial mass m = m at an arbitrary time t = writing the rate as dm/dt = m f, we adopted rst the natural choice of setting f . that means, we assumed the effective energy density and effective pressure to act on the same footing. the result, shown in section ii.a, was that the mass accretion is negative; m linearly in near the singularity. otherwise, for the effective energy density and pressure, the big rip characteristics were recovered. the laminar energy density component , however, was found to obey a milder singularity than e; cf. eq. . in section ii.a we also investigated the extreme case of strong turbulence, putting e and pe simply proportional to h. the result was quite a different evolution of the universe, being of de sitter type with a hubble parameter simply equal to h. section ii.b dealt with the ansatz f e. this case was found to yield positive mass accretion, but the solution for m showed a strange behavior making us conclude that this option is of less physical interest. in the nal section iii, we made some simple comparisons with the evolution of a black hole in the early uni- verse. at the inationary stage, m is typically found to increase with time until a stationary state is approached. however, also in the early universe, negative mass accretion has been found to occur .

"arxiv:v dec private information retrieval from non-replicated databases karim banawan sennur ulukus department of electrical and computer engineering university of maryland, college park, md kbanawan@umd.edu ulukus@umd.edu january , abstract we consider the problem of private information retrieval of a single message out of k messages from n non-colluding and non-replicated databases. dierent from the majority of the existing literature, which considers the case of replicated databases where all databases store the same content in the form of all k messages, here, we consider the case of non-replicated databases under a special non-replication structure where each database stores m out of k messages and each message is stored across r dierent databases. this generates an r-regular graph structure for the storage system where the vertices of the graph are the messages and the edges are the databases. we derive a general upper bound for m = that depends on the graph structure. we then specialize the problem to storage systems described by two special types of graph structures: cyclic graphs and fully-connected graphs. we prove that the pir capacity for the case of cyclic graphs is k+, and the pir capacity for the case of fully-connected graphs is min{ k , }. to that end, we propose novel achievable schemes for both graph structures that are capacity-achieving. the central insight in both schemes is to introduce dependency in the queries submitted to databases that do not contain the desired message, such that the requests can be compressed. in both cases, the results show severe degradation in pir capacity due to non-replication.","Private information retrieval is explored in the context of non-replicated databases with a special non-replication structure.

"private information retrieval , introduced in , is a canonical problem to study the privacy of users as they download content from public databases. in the classical setting, a user is interested in retrieving a single message out of k messages from n replicated and this work was supported by nsf grants cns -, ccf - and eccs - non-colluding databases, in such a way that no database can know the identity of the users desired le. the pir problem has become a vibrant research topic within information theory starting with trailblazing papers . in , sun and jafar introduce the pir capacity, which is the supremum of the ratio of the number of bits of desired information that can be retrieved privately to the total downloaded information. they characterize the pir capacity of the classical pir problem to be cpir = (+ n + + nk) the fundamental limits of many interesting variants of the problem have been investigated in . a common assumption in most of these works is that the entire message set is replicated across all databases. this is crucial for constructing capacity-achieving schemes, as in many existing schemes the undesired symbols downloaded from one database are exploited as side information in the remaining databases, and replication is the key that enables downloading any bit from any database and using it as side information at any other database. however, the replication assumption may not be practical in next-generation storage systems and networks. from a storage point of view, message replication is impractical as it incurs high storage cost, especially for storage systems with a large number of messages or les with a large size. from a network structure point of view, in next-generation networks where peer-to-peer connections will be prevalent, nodes may not necessarily possess the same set of messages. these practical scenarios, which challenge the replication assumption, motivate investigating pir in non-replicated storage systems. in this work, we aim at devising achievable schemes that do not rely on message replication, and at the same time, that are more ecient than the trivial scheme of downloading the contents of all databases. we aim at evaluating the loss in the pir rate due to non-replication and investigating the interplay between the storage structure and the resulting pir rate. a few works have considered relaxing the replication assumption: reference inves- tigates the case when the contents of the databases are encoded via an mds code instead of assuming data replication. derives the pir capacity for this setting, which reveals a fundamental tradeobetween storage cost and retrieval cost. reference stud- ies the pir problem from storage constrained databases. in this problem, each database is constrained to store kl uncoded bits with (as opposed to kl bits needed in repli- cated databases). shows that symmetric batch caching, which was originally introduced for centralized coded caching systems in , results in the largest possible pir rate under storage constraints. this problem is extended to the decentralized setting in , where each database stores kl bits randomly and independently from any other database. shows that uniform and random bit selection, which was introduced for decentralized coded caching systems in , results in the largest possible pir rate under storage constraints. the work that is most closely related to our work here is . the databases in store dierent subsets of the message set. dierent from the previous works on non-replication such as , in databases store full messages and not portions of every message. in particular, investigates the case when every message is replicated across two databases only. this storage system, in this case, can be represented by a graph, in which every two databases are connected via an edge corresponding to the common message. proposes an achievable pir scheme that is immune against colluding databases, that do not form a cycle in the graph. the scheme in achieves a retrieval rate of n . the work in highlights some interesting insights about the relation between some combinatorial properties of the graph and the immunity against database collusion. in the extended version of in , which has appeared concurrently and independently of our work here, an upper bound is proposed to show that their pir rate is at most a factor of from the optimal value for regular graphs, and the techniques are extended to larger replication factors. in this paper, we consider pir of a single message out of k messages from n non- replicated and non-colluding databases. in our formulation, each message appears in r dierent databases, and every database stores m dierent messages. thus, the storage system is parameterized by such that kr = mn, where k is the total number of messages in the system, r is the replication factor of each message, m is the storage constraint of each database, and n is the number of databases. we focus on the case m = for this case, the storage system can be uniquely specied by an r-regular graph. in our graph formulation, the messages correspond to the vertices and the databases correspond to the edges. this is in contrast to , where r = , and the roles of messages and databases are reversed on the graph. hence, our graph formulation may be considered as the dual graph formulation to . our goal is to characterize the pir capacity of this system. first, we derive a general upper bound on the retrieval rate for storage systems described by r-regular graphs. interestingly, the upper bound depends on the structure of the graph and not only on . in particular, the upper bound is related to the longest sequence of databases that cover all of the k messages in the storage system. we specialize the problem further to two classes of graphs, namely, cyclic graphs and fully-connected graphs, where we obtain exact results. in cyclic graphs, all vertices form a circle connected by edges. therefore, each vertex emanates two edges , which means that each message is common among two adjacent databases which are arranged in a cycle. thus, in this case r = , and since m = in this paper, using kr = mn mentioned above, we have, k = n. for this type of graphs, we show that cpir = k+ the achievable scheme starts from the greedy algorithm of sun and jafar and then compresses the requests to k databases by replacing the individual symbols of the scheme in by sum of two messages. this compression necessitates exploiting side information even in databases that do not contain the desired messages. in fully-connected graphs, each vertex is connected to all of the remaining k vertices. therefore, each vertex emanates k edges , which means that each message resides in k databases. thus, in this case r = k , and since m = , from kr = mn, we have n = k/, i.e., n =  k  . that is, all  k  combinations of two messages appear in a dierent database. in this case, we show that cpir = min{ k, }. for k , for this case, we propose a novel achievable scheme, which is based on retrieving a single weighted sum (with respect to suciently large eld) of two symbols from every database. for the comparable cases with , our scheme outperforms their scheme in terms of the pir rate. we note that, in both cyclic and fully-connected graph cases, the pir capacity converges to zero as n , which implies a severe degradation in the pir eciency due to non-replication. finally, we show an example for a storage system with m = we provide a novel achievable scheme that uses processed side information and outperforms the scheme in .","Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a fundamental problem in studying user privacy when accessing content from public databases. Traditional PIR schemes involve retrieving a single message from replicated databases without revealing the user's identity. However, the replication assumption may not be practical in next-generation storage systems and networks. Recent research is focusing on PIR in non-replicated storage systems, aiming to develop efficient schemes without relying on message replication. Different graph structures are analyzed to characterize PIR capacity in non-replicated and non-colluding databases. Achievable schemes are proposed for cyclic and fully-connected graphs, showing degradation in PIR efficiency as replication decreases. The study highlights the trade-off between storage cost and retrieval rate in PIR systems."
"consider the problem of pir from n non-replicated and non-colluding databases. we denote the databases by d = {d, d, , dn}. the storage system stores k messages in total, each message is stored across r dierent databases, i.e., r is the repetition factor for every message, and each database stores locally m dierent messages. we denote the message set by w = {w, w, , wk}. each message wk fl q is a vector of length l picked in an i.i.d. fashion from a suciently large nite eld fl q , h = l, k {, , k} h = h = kl, the storage system is parameterized by . we note that for a feasible storage system , we have kr = mn. in this work, we focus on the case m = to fully characterize the storage system in this case, we represent the storage system as r-regular graph; see fig. and table for a example. we characterize the storage system by a regular graph, where v = w = {w, w, , wk} is the set of vertices, and e = d = {d, d, , dn} is the set of edges, i.e., in this graph, the vertices are the messages and the edges are the databases. an edge dj drawn between messages wm and wk means that the contents of database dj is zj = {wm, wk}. this graph is an r-regular graph, since each message is repeated r times across the storage system. in the following, we dene specic parameters of the graph, which are needed while constructing the converse proof. denition the graph = is reduced iteratively start- ing with the vertex w by enumerating all the edges connecting to w, and removing all neighboring vertices connected to enumerated edges except one, which we denote by w the process of enumerating edges and removing corresponding neighbors iteratively continues until one vertex is left w+ after reductions. we note that the graph used in our formulation may be considered as the dual graph of the one used in . in our work, m = , the nodes are the messages and the edges are the databases, while in , r = , the nodes are the databases and the edges are the messages. d w w w w w w d d d d d d d d figure : graph structure for an example storage system. d d d d d d d d d w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w table : contents of databases for the example system specied by graph in fig. denition the spread of a graph is the largest sequence of edges that results from the graph reduction procedure given in denition an example graph reduction for the storage system given in fig. and table is shown in fig. in this work, we further focus on two special classes of r-regular graphs, namely: cyclic graphs and fully-connected graphs. denition the graph = is called a cyclic graph if each two adjacent vertices are connected by an edge and no non-adjacent vertices are connected by an edge, i.e., the contents of the databases can be written as : z = {w, w} z = {w, w} . . . zn = {wn, wn} zn = {wn, w} consequently, the cyclic graph is parameterized by = , and the spread of the graph is = k denition the graph = is called fully-connected enumerate d, d, d w w w w w d d d d d d d d d w enumerate d, d w w w d d remove w, w, w figure : graph reduction for the example storage system. the end result of graph reduction is the sequence of databases d, d, d, d, d neighbors of w are specied and the connected databases are enumerated. all neighboring vertices except w are removed, and so on. if every two vertices are connected by a unique edge. hence, the contents of the databases can be written as the  k  subsets of {, , k} with elements. the fully-connected graph is parameterized by = (k, k , ,  k  ), and the spread of the graph is = k in pir, the user wants to retrieve a message wk without leaking any information about the identity of the message to any individual database. to that end, the user sends n queries, one for each database. these queries are independent of the messages as the user has no information about the messages prior to retrieval, hence, i(w; q :n) = , k the databases respond to the user queries by answer strings a :n. the answer string a n is a deterministic function of the query q n and the contents of the database dn, which is denoted by zn, therefore, h(a n |q n , zn) = , n in pir, we have two formal requirements. first, we have the privacy requirement. to ensure privacy, the retrieval strategy intended to retrieve wi must be indistinguishable from the retrieval strategy intended to retrieve wj for any i and j, i.e., (q n , a n , w) (q n , a n , w), n , i, j where denotes statistical equivalence. the second requirement is the reliability requirement. the user needs to be able to reconstruct wk perfectly from the collected answers, i.e., h(wk|q :n, a :n) = we measure the eciency of the retrieval scheme by the retrieval rate rpir. an achievable retrieval scheme is a scheme that satises , for some message length l. the retrieval rate is the ratio between the length of the desired message l and the total download, rpir = l pn n= h(a n ) the pir capacity is the largest pir rate over all achievable schemes, i.e., cpir = sup rpir.","The problem formulation focuses on private information retrieval (PIR) from non-replicated and non-colluding databases. The storage system stores k messages distributed across r databases with each database storing m different messages. The system is represented as an r-regular graph, where vertices represent messages and edges represent databases. The spread of the graph is determined by a reduction procedure. The text discusses two special classes of r-regular graphs: cyclic graphs and fully-connected graphs. PIR involves retrieving a message without revealing its identity to any individual database through independent queries. Privacy and reliability requirements are essential, ensuring indistinguishability between retrieval strategies and perfect message reconstruction. The efficiency of a retrieval scheme is measured by the retrieval rate rpir, which is the ratio of desired message length to total download. The PIR capacity is the maximum achievable PIR rate over all schemes."
"in this section, we present the main results of this paper. our rst result is a general upper bound for storage systems dened by r-regular graphs with m = and arbitrary which is given in the following theorem. the proof of theorem is given in section theorem for an r-regular graph storage sys- tem with = , the retrieval rate is upper bounded by rpir min ( r n , + r ) remark the upper bound reveals a dependency on the structure of the storage system, captured in the spread of the graph . i.e., the upper bound cannot be parameterized by only. this opens the door for joint optimization of the storage system together with the retrieval scheme. remark the upper bound rpir + r is a general upper bound which is valid for any storage system with m = and is represented via an r-regular graph (including the example shown in figs. and ). in this paper, we focus on two special cases, namely: cyclic graphs: in this case, the spread of the graph is = k as we can cover all the messages in the storage system by visiting exactly k databases. furthermore, r = , as every node in the graph is connected to adjacent nodes only. applying the bound in theorem , rpir + r = + k = k+ the results of this work do not change if we relaxed the reliability constraint to allow arbitrarily small probability of error, i.e., if we changed the reliability constraint as h(wk|q :n, a :n) = o. fully-connected graphs: in this case, the spread of the graph is = r as w is connected to all other messages. applying the bound in theorem , rpir + r = + r r = also, in this case, r = k and n = k/, hence, rpir r n = k/ = k. in the following two results, we characterize the pir capacity of cyclic graphs and fully- connected graphs. the converse proofs for theorems and are corollaries of theorem as shown in remark the achievability proofs of theorems and are given in section theorem for a cyclic graph storage system, the pir ca- pacity is given by cpir = k + theorem for a fully-connected graph storage system with m = , the pir capacity is given by cpir = ( , k = , k, k remark the capacity results in this work reveal a severe loss in the retrieval rate due to non-replication. for the cyclic and fully-connected graphs, cpir as n . this is in contrast to the classical pir problem , where cpir as n . this is intuitively due to the fact that as n , we have k . meanwhile, the number of side information equations generated is limited due to non-replication. in particular, the side information equations are related to r , while total downloads grow with n as the user needs to download from all databases to satisfy the privacy constraint. the ratio r n as n for both cases. remark the results of this work outperform the trivial scheme of downloading all mes- sages, which achieves k. our retrieval rate also outperforms the best achievable scheme in , which achieves n for cyclic graphs . the achievable rate n = k < k+ for the case of cyclic graphs. this implies that the retrieval rates in non-replicated pir systems in may be improved. nevertheless, the results in are more general which are valid for all graph-based storage systems. the results in also cover collusion resistance, which is outside the scope of our work here.","The section presents the main results of the paper, focusing on upper bounds for storage systems defined by r-regular graphs. The upper bounds are dependent on the structure of the storage system, specifically captured in the spread of the graph. Two main cases are discussed: cyclic graphs, where the spread is k, and fully-connected graphs, where the spread is r. The paper provides upper bounds for retrieval rates in both cases. The achieved retrieval rates in non-replicated PIR systems outperform previous schemes and show potential for improvement. The results also cover collusion resistance in graph-based storage systems."
"in this section, we prove theorem to that end, we present a general upper bound for the retrieval rate for general r-regular graphs for the case of m = let q denote the collection of all queries to all databases for all desired messages, i.e., q  q n : k , n we assume that the retrieval scheme is symmetric across databases . this assumption is without loss of generality, since any asymmetric retrieval scheme can be transformed into a symmetric one by means of time-sharing without changing the retrieval rate. hence, for m {, , k}, we have h(a |q) = h(a n |q), n {, , n} h(a |w \ {wm}, q) = h(a n |w \ {wm}, q), n {, , n} where w \ {wm} = {w, w, , wm, wm+, , wk}. we need the following lemma. lemma let rm denote the set of databases containing message wm, then h(a n |w \ {wm}, q) l r, n rm proof: we have l = h = h = h h(wm|w \ {wm}, q, a :n) = h h(wm|w \ {wm}, q, a rm) = i(wm; a rm|w \ {wm}, q) = h(a rm|w \ {wm}, q) rh(a n |w \ {wm}, q), n rm where follows from the fact that wm is independent of the messages and the queries , follows from the reliability constraint. for , we note that the answer strings a m = {a n : n rm} are deterministic functions of only, hence wm a m is a markov chain and a m can be dropped from the conditioning. follows from the fact that answer strings are deterministic functions of the messages and queries, and follows from the database symmetry in . rearranging concludes the proof. we are now ready to prove the converse statement in theorem we rst prove that rpir r n . from lemma , we have l rh(a n |w \ {wm}, q), n rm = r n nh(a n |w \ {wm}, q) r n nh(a n |q) = r n n x n= h(a n |q) where follows from the fact that conditioning reduces entropy, follows from the symmetry across databases. therefore, rpir = l pn n= h(a n ) l pn n= h(a n |q) r n next, we prove that rpir + r , where is the spread of the graph; see denition in order to obtain the spread of the graph, we begin by the node representing w, then we enumerate all the edges connecting to w without loss of generality, label these databases by , , , r. these edges are connecting to the nodes corresponding to {wn, wn, , wnr}. then, we reduce the graph by removing all the connecting nodes to w except one , which we denote by w {wn, wn, , wnr}. we again enumerate all the edges connecting to w with the nodes {wnr+, wnr+, , wnr+}, where is the number of databases that contain w after the graph reduction, then we reduce the graph again by removing all nodes connecting to w except one, which we denote by w, and so on. then, we have l = h = h h(w|a :n, q) = i(w; a :n|q) = h(a :n|q) h(a :n|w, q) nh(a |q) h(a :n|w, q) nh(a |q) h(a |w, q) = nh(a |q) x i= h(a i |w, q, a :i) nh(a |q) x i= h(a i |w, w \ {wni}, q, a :i) = nh(a |q) x i= h(a i |w, w \ {wni}, q) where follows from the reliability constraint and the independence of queries and mes- sages, follows from the independence bound, follows from the non-negativity of the entropy function where a denotes the answer strings returned by the sequence of the databases that dene the spread of the graph, and follows from the fact that conditioning on w \ {wi} cannot increase entropy. to show , we note that from the reduction procedure that results in a , we have a i = fi, i r fi(q, w, wni), r + i r + fi(q, w, wni), r + + i r + + . . . fi(q, w, wni), r + p j= j + i r + p j= j for some deterministic function fi, and is the number of reductions on the graph until all nodes are removed from the graph. since the leading message at the jth graph reduction wj belongs to the set of the connected messages in the th graph reduction, and at the jth graph reduction, the nodes connecting to wj are removed from the graph, we have { w, w, , wj} {wn, wn, , wni} w \ {wni}, where j is the index of the leading message in the ith database. consequently, we can drop a :i as they are deterministic functions of . now, we have l nh(a |q) x i= h(a i |w, w \ {wni}, q) = nh(a |q) x i= h(a i |w, w \ {wni}, q) nh(a |q) x i= l r = nh(a |q) l r where follows from the privacy constraint, and follows from lemma reordering terms, we have rpir = l pn n= h(a n ) l nh(a |q) + r which together with concludes the proof of theorem","In this section, a general upper bound for the retrieval rate of general r-regular graphs is presented, assuming a symmetric retrieval scheme. A lemma is provided to support the proof, showcasing the reduction in entropy through conditioning and the symmetry across databases. The text further delves into proving the converse statement in a theorem, demonstrating that the retrieval rate is impacted by the spread of the graph. The spread is defined by nodes and edges connecting to them, with reductions made to calculate the spread. The proof involves considering deterministic functions of answer strings and emphasizing the constraints of reliability and privacy. The theorem is ultimately proven by showing the relationship between retrieval rate, entropy, and graph spread."
"in this section, we begin rst with a motivating example of = to show the basic ingredients of the achievable scheme. in fact, the graph for this motivating d w w w d d figure : graph structure for the system used as a motivating example. database database database w w w w w w table : contents of databases for the system specied by graph in fig. example is both cyclic and fully-connected , therefore, this motivating example can be considered as a unifying instance of the optimal scheme for both cyclic and fully- connected graphs. then, we present general capacity-achieving schemes for cyclic graphs and fully-connected graphs. finally, we show by an example how we can extend the presented schemes to the case of m . motivating example: k = , r = , m = , n = in this example, we consider a storage system that consists of n = databases. the system stores k = messages in total, namely w, w, w each message is replicated across r = databases, such that each database stores m = messages . this is a cyclic and also a fully-connected graph as shown in fig. without loss of generality, assume that the desired message is w to construct the capacity-achieving scheme, the user randomly permutes the indices of messages w, w, w independently, uniformly, and privately from the databases. denote the permuted version of w by the vector , the permuted version of w by , and the permuted version of w by . pick l = a straightforward solution for this problem is to apply sun and jafar scheme in . since every database contains m = messages, the user downloads a single bit from each message from each database in round , i.e., the user downloads a, b from database , a, c from database , and b, c from database now, the user exploits b, c as side information by downloading a + b from database , and a + c from database finally, the user downloads the sum b + c from database the query table for this scheme is shown in table note that although the sum b + c is irrelevant to the decodability of w, the user needs to download it to satisfy the privacy constraint. otherwise, database would gure out that the desired message is w, as the user requests bits from database when the desired message is w, while the user would have requested bits from database if the desired message was w or w with this scheme, the user downloads bits from w out of the total downloads, hence rpir = database database database a a b b c c a + b a + c b + c table : sun and jafar scheme for the k = , r = , m = , n = example. although this scheme outperforms the scheme in in terms of the retrieval rate (the scheme in achieves rpir = ), there is room for improving it. the main source of ineciency of the scheme is the downloads from database , as the user downloads bits and exploits only of them. moreover, the user downloads new independent bit b + c if the user introduces dependency to the downloads of database , the user may compress the requests from database , and improve the retrieval rate. in order to do this, the user downloads the sums b + c and b + c from database . for the decodability, the user can decode c by canceling b from b + c and b by canceling c from b + c therefore, a, a are decodable by canceling b and c database database database a a b c a + b a + c b + c b + c table : compressing the scheme of sun and jafar for k = , r = , m = , n = nevertheless, the scheme in table is not private because the user still downloads bits from database in the form of sum of bits. to remedy this problem, the user should repeat the compression of the downloads over all databases, i.e., the user should download bits in the same manner of downloading from database in the other two databases as well. hence, in repetition , the user compresses the downloads from database and downloads a + c, throughout this work, we use the expressions dependency and compression. in previous pir works, the user downloads new and independent undesired symbols at each round, which can be used in later rounds as side information. however, in this work, the user downloads undesired symbols which are dependent on the undesired symbols downloaded from other databases. we download these dependent symbols even from the databases that do not contain the desired message. we call these dependent downloads to dierentiate them from side information downloads, which are intended to be used to decode the desired message directly. furthermore, by compression, we mean downloading shorter answer strings than the greedy algorithm in by exploiting the knowledge of the dependent symbols. database database database rep. a a b c a + b a + c b + c b + c rep. a b b c a + b a + c b + c a + c rep. a b c c a + b a + c b + c a + b table : complete query structure for the capacity-achieving scheme for k = , r = , m = , n = a + c similarly, in repetition , the user downloads a + b and a + b from database the complete query structure is given in table next, we discuss privacy, decodability and the rate of this achievable scheme. regarding privacy: the query structure is now symmetric across the databases, and the indices of the bits from each message are chosen uniformly, independently and privately. hence, all queries are equally likely, and the scheme is private. regarding decodability: we note that each repetition is decodable separately. as we discussed above, a, , a are decodable in repetition for repetition , a is decodable directly, a is decodable by canceling b from a+b, and a is decodable by canceling c from a + c finally, c is decodable by canceling b from b + c and therefore a is decodable by further canceling c from a + c (or equivalently by adding a + c and b + c under modulo- addition and canceling b from the sum). the decodability of repetition follows in a similar way to the decodability of repetition by exchanging the roles of w, w regarding the achievable rate: the user downloads bits from w out of a total of downloads. consequently, rpir = = which matches the upper bound in theorem remark it is interesting to compare the pir capacity here to the pir capacity in where the contents are stored in the databases using the optimal storage strategy under the memory-size constraint . note that, in this example, = as every database stores full messages out of messages. using the optimal storage strategy in , the pir capacity is cpir = (+ + ) = which is larger than the pir capacity here cpir = this implies a loss in the pir capacity due to storing full messages here as opposed to storing uncoded parts of the messages in subject to the same memory-size constraint.","The ""Achievability Proof"" section introduces a motivating example showcasing an achievable scheme for cyclic and fully-connected graphs. The section presents capacity-achieving schemes for both types of graphs and demonstrates how these schemes can be extended to a specific example with parameters k=3, r=2, m=1, n=3. The schemes involve downloading bits from databases, using side information, and introducing dependency to improve efficiency and retrieval rates. Privacy, decodability, and the achievable rate of the scheme are discussed, showing that the scheme achieves a retrieval rate of rpir=2. The section also compares the performance of the scheme to the optimal storage strategy under a memory-size constraint, indicating a loss in capacity when storing full messages instead of uncoded parts."
"in this paper, we investigated the pir problem from non-replicated and non-colluding databases. we studied the storage systems, where every database stores m = messages. this system is uniquely described by an r-regular graph. we proved a general upper bound, which depends on the spread of the graph. we derived the capacity of two classes of graphs, namely: cyclic graphs and fully-connected graphs. for these two classes of graphs, we proposed novel achievable schemes, whose retrieval rate matches the developed upper bound. our results showed that non-replication signicantly hurts the retrieval rate. references b. chor, e. kushilevitz, o. goldreich, and m. sudan. private information retrieval. journal of the acm, :, november n. b. shah, k. v. rashmi, and k. ramchandran. one extra

fuller, & lai ; burkart et al. and references therein), and kepler (kirk et al. ) has now identied over heartbeat stars. the light curves of heartbeat stars are dened by oscillations outside of periastron combined with a brief, high amplitude ellip- soidal variation at periastron that gives rise to a unique heartbeat signature resembling the normal sinus rhythm of an electrocardio- gram. the light curves of these systems are dominated by the eects of tidal distortion, reection and doppler beaming close to perias- tron . heartbeat stars continue to oscillate throughout their orbit due to tidally excited stellar oscillations. the variability amplitude of most heartbeat stars is very small ( mmag; kirk et al. ; hambleton et al. ). the tidally excited oscillations occur at exact integer e-mail: jayasinghearachchilage.@osu.edu multiples of the orbital frequency . teos were rst discovered in the eccentric binary system hd (maceroni et al. ) and later conrmed in koi and several other systems . the largest amplitude teos are driven by resonances between harmonics of the orbital frequency and the normal mode frequencies of the star. both the amplitudes and phases of teos can be predicted from linear theory . the vast majority of the heartbeat stars that have been dis- covered are relatively low-mass a and f type stars. however, the heartbeat phenomenon extends to more massive ob stars as well. ori is the most massive heartbeat star system yet discovered and it consists of a o iii primary and a b iii-iv companion (pablo et al. ). the dearth of massive heartbeat stars is likely an ob- servational bias because massive stars are rare and kepler observed only a small fraction of the sky, mostly lying othe galactic plane. ground-based surveys cover most or all of the sky but nd it chal- lenging to detect the low variability amplitudes of typical heartbeat stars . the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn, shappee et al. ; kochanek et al. ) has been monitoring the entire visible sky for several years to a depth of mag with a cadence of days using two units in chile and hawaii, each with telescopes. as of the end of , asas-sn uses telescopes to the authors arxiv:v feb t. jayasinghe et al. observe the entire sky daily, but all current observations are taken with a -band lter. we have written a series of papers studying variable stars using asas-sn data. in paper i (jayasinghe et al. a), we reported , new variables that were discovered during the search for supernovae. in paper ii (jayasinghe et al. a), we homogeneously analyzed , known variables from the vsx catalog, and developed a robust variability classier utilizing the asas-sn v-band light curves and data from external catalogues. in paper iii , we conducted a variability search towards the southern ecliptic pole in order to overlap with the the transiting exoplanet survey satellite (tess; ricker et al. ) continuous viewing zone . we identied , variables, of which , were new discoveries. tess is currently conducting science operations by monitoring most of the sky with a baseline of at least days. sources closer to the tess cvz will be observed for a substantially longer period, approaching one year at the ecliptic poles. tess full-frame images , sampled at a cadence of min, are made publicly available, allowing for the study of short time scale variability across most of the sky. here we discuss the identication of the most extreme amplitude heartbeat star yet discovered, macho . , using both asas-sn and tess photometry. the macho survey reported that the source was a variable, but classied it as an eclipsing binary . macho . was rst identied as a likely heartbeat star during our asas-sn variability search. we discuss archival data and the asas-sn and tess observations in section in section , we t an analytical model for the tidal dis- tortions to estimate several orbital parameters of the binary system. in section , we discuss our sed ts to this source and the physical implications of these ts. in section , we identify tidally excited oscillations through a periodogram analysis and present a summary of our results in section archival, asas-sn and tess data for macho . the source macho . was identied as a variable by the macho survey , who classied it as a generic eclipsing binary. two values for the orbital period, corre- sponding to the red and blue bandpasses, were derived using their data: red = d, blue = d. macho . is a blue source with = mag, = mag with estimated values for the photometric temperature log = and bolometric magnitude bol = . this source is part of the lh ob association in the large magellanic cloud , northwest of doradus. an archival spectrum classied it as a b ib/ii (garmany et al. ), evolved blue star. based on this information, this source is likely to have a mass the gaia dr counterpart is source_id= its nominal dr parallax is negative and the proper motion is = mas yr, = mas yr there might be evidence of problems with the astrometric solution, as the of the t is high and the excess astrometric noise is mas. on the other hand, the renormalized unit weight error (ruwe; lindegren et al. ) of the source is and lindegren et al. argue that gaia dr astrometric solutions are accurate if they have a ruwe < . to evaluate the proper motions, we examined gaia dr stars with < mag within of macho . these stars had medians of mas ( < < ), mas yr and mas yr for their parallax and proper motions. hence the parallax and proper motions of macho . are typ- ical of the local population of luminous stars. if we use the median proper motions to dene a local standard of rest, the relative motion of macho . is mas yr, or roughly km s at a distance of kpc. the median motion of the nearby stars rela- tive to this standard of rest is mas yr or roughly km s asas-sn v-band observations were made by the cassius"" quadruple telescope between and each camera has a eld of view of deg, the pixel scale is and the fwhm is pixels. the light curves for this source was extracted as described in kochanek et al. using aperture pho- tometry with a pixel radius aperture. the aavso photometric all-sky survey dr catalog was used for absolute photometric calibration. the asas-sn v-band light curve has a time baseline of d. we derived possi- ble periods for this source following the procedure described in jayasinghe et al. . the astrobase implementation of the generalized lomb-scargle (gls, zech- meister & krster ; scargle ), the multi-harmonic anal- ysis of variance , and the box least squares periodograms were used to search for periodicity in these light curves. we calculated the laer-kinmann string length statistic on the phased light curve for each period using the denition = n = n = from clarke , where the are the magnitudes sorted by phase and is the mean magnitude. the best period is the period with the smallest , which in this case is the best bls period. asassn = d, which agrees with the macho periods to within %. the asas-sn light curve hence contains orbits of this system. the error in the period was estimated using the spacing in the bls frequency grid , where = / = d. macho . lies in the southern tess cvz which allowed us to extract tess light curves for both sectors and due to the large pixel size of tess and the crowded region sur- rounding macho ., we used image subtraction (alard & lupton ; alard ) on the full frame images from the rst tess data release to produce high delity light curves. the day baseline for tess observations in each sector is insuf- cient to obtain a full orbit for this source, but the nal tess light curve with data from all the sectors in the south should sample the variability of this source very well. the dierence light curve was normalized to match the asas-sn -band light curve. the ephemeris for the minimum of the ellipsoidal variation in asas-sn is ephemi = bjd + e , whereas the ephemeris for the minimum of the ellipsoidal variation in tess is ephemii = bjd + e , mnras , an extreme hb star in the lmc relative flux nepochs = asas-sn v-band phase relative flux nepochs = tess sector relative flux nepochs = tess sector figure the phased asas-sn , tess sector , and tess sector light curves for the source macho . mnras , t. jayasinghe et al. log amplitude known hb stars macho . figure the period-amplitude diagram for the sample of heartbeat stars. heartbeat stars listed in the vsx database are indicated by blue diamonds. macho . is shown with a red star. where the epoch e is the number of orbits since the time of mini- mum. the phased asas-sn and tess sector + light curves are shown in figure the uncertainties in relative ux are virtually indistinguishable from the points in the tess light curves. the teos are clearly visible in the tess light curves (red and green points), but are less distinguishable in the asas-sn light curve . the peak-to-peak ux variations at periastron of % ( mag) are the largest observed for a heartbeat system. this is illus- trated in figure , where we compare the period and amplitude of macho . to those of the heartbeat stars in the vsx catalog . the ux variations outside of perias- tron are also extreme . fuller notes that very large amplitude teos are unlikely to arise from a chance resonance and are more likely to stem from a resonantly locked mode. modelling the eccentric ellipsoidal variations kumar et al. developed an analytical model (their equation ) for the ux variations produced by the tidal distortions produced by eccentric binaries at periastron. thompson et al. success- fully applied this model to t the light curves of the heartbeat stars observed by kepler. we t the fractional ux /of the asas- sn and tess light curves following thompson et al. . the t contains six parameters: the amplitude scaling factor, , a fractional ux oset, , the true anomaly, , the angle of periastron, , the orbital inclination, and the eccentricity, , = sin sin ) /) + , where = cos , = arctan + tan  ! , and the eccentric anomaly is derived from solving keplers table best t parameters for macho . description asas-sn tess angle of periastron orbital inclination orbital eccentricity transcendental equation . we per- formed a trial t through the levenberg-marquardt chi-square min- imization routine in scikit-learn . the parameters from the trial t were then used to initialize a monte carlo markov chain sampler with walkers, and was then run for iterations. we used the mcmc implementation through emcee . the errors in the parameters were derived from the mcmc chains. these ts do not capture the depth of the minimum or the height of the maximum completely, suggesting that this model is an incomplete description of the light curve. formally, the estimates for and from tting the asas-sn and tess light curves dier by , but the actual dierences of < are remarkably small given the very dierent characters of the two light curves. the eccentricities derived from the two ts are consistent to within while this model does not account for eects such as irradiation and doppler boosting, it is a good approximation of the tidal distortions during the orbit and can be used to estimate the orbital parameters of this system without requiring further knowledge about the properties of the stars in the system. the best-t models for the asas-sn and combined sector + tess data for macho . are shown in the top panel of figure with the solid red lines. the best t parameters are summarized in table we attempted tting a standard eclipsing binary model includ- ing irradiation and reection eects to the asas-sn v-band light curve using phoebe but were unable to replicate the observed variability amplitude. this is not very surprising because the high amplitude pulses are almost certainly due to transient dynamical tides that are not included in normal eclipsing binary modeling codes. unfortunately, there are no public codes for modeling heartbeat stars which include these eects. we have put oattempts at more detailed models until we have the radial velocity data needed to better constrain the orbit and masses. we will also explore a simultaneous t to the light curve incorporating both the binary star features and the tidally induced pulsations with phoebe .","Heartbeat stars are eccentric binaries with oscillations excited by tidal forcing at periastron passages. These stars, first discovered by the Kepler telescope, exhibit unique heartbeat signatures resembling electrocardiogram rhythms. They are dominated by tidal distortion effects close to periastron and continue to oscillate throughout their orbits. Most of these stars are low-mass, but more massive types have also been identified, such as the most massive known, Ori. The text discusses the discovery and analysis of the most extreme amplitude heartbeat star, Macho, using data from ASAS-SN and TESS. The text covers the identification of Macho, analysis of its orbital parameters, identification of tidally excited oscillations through periodogram analysis, and modeling of tidal distortions. Challenges in modeling high amplitude pulses and potential future research directions are also discussed."

"weyl semimetals are materials with a relativisticlike energy spectrum in the vicinity of isolated weyl nodes in the brillouin zone. the nodes have nonzero topological charges with the monopolelike berry curvature and always occur in pairs of opposite chirality . in each pair, the weyl nodes can be separated in energy and/or momentum, which indicates breaking of the parity-inversion and/or time-reversal symmetries, respectively. the nontrivial topology and the relativisticlike nature of quasiparticles also aect the transport properties of weyl semimetals, e.g., leading to a negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity that was rst predicted in ref. . the nontrivial bulk topology of weyl semimetals is also reected in unusual surface states known as the fermi arcs . unlike surface states in ordinary materials, the fermi arcs form open segments in momentum space that connect weyl nodes of opposite chirality . the surface states in weyl semimetals were rst observed via the angle-resolved photoemision spectroscopy and reconrmed later by the observation of the quasiparticle interference patterns . it is important to note that the energy dispersion of the fermi arc states is eectively one dimensional and linear . this may suggest that their transport properties are similar to that of the one-dimensional chiral fermions and should be nondissipative. however, as we showed in ref. , the fermi arc transport is, in fact, dissipative because of the scattering between the surface and bulk states in weyl semimetals. the dissolution of fermi arcs in the presence of strong disorder was also conrmed numerically in refs. . electronic collective excitations provide additional powerful probes of the nontrivial properties of weyl semimetals. the topology is imprinted, for example, in anomalous helicons , surface plasmon polaritons , chiral magnetic plasmons , etc. the eect of the fermi arcs on the surface plasmons was studied in refs. . the authors of ref. employed a simple phenomenological model valid in the long-wavelength limit. the hybridization of the fermi arc states and conventional surface plasmons is controlled via the anomalous hall conductivity and a phenomenologically included drude weight. further, the surface plasmon excitation spectrum in weyl semimetal within the random-phase approximation was determined in ref. . the treatment of the surface plasmons in ref. is more sophisticated and is based on the direct quantum-mechanical calculations. despite the dierence in their approaches, studies in refs. predict the open hyperbolic constant-frequency contours for the surface plasmons. the nontrivial patterns of the surface plasmons can be measured by the scattering-type near-eld optical spectroscopy as well as the momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy . experimentally, the electron energy loss in weyl semimetals was recently studied in ref. . since weyl semimetals are typically characterized by low impurity scattering rates (see, e.g., refs. for the scattering rates and crystal quality estimations), one might suggest that a hydrodynamic regime of electron transport could be eventually realized in many such materials. originally, the possibility of such a regime for charge carriers in suciently clean solids was discussed in the pioneering papers by gurzhi . electron hydrodynamics requires that the electron-electron scattering rate dominates over the electron-impurity and electron-phonon ones. recently, such a regime was experimentally conrmed in the weyl semimetal tungsten diphosphide , where the characteristic quadratic dependence of the electrical resistivity on the cross section of the wire as well as a strong violation of the wiedemannfranz law were observed. theoretically, the nontrivial topological properties of weyl semimetals, connected with the energy and momentum separations between weyl nodes, are taken into account in the recently proposed framework of consistent hydro- dynamics . the latter includes several types of chernsimons contributions in the electric current and charge densities that aect not only the electron transport in weyl semimetals , but also their various collective excitations . it is natural to ask, therefore, whether the hydrodynamic regime could be also realized for the fermi arc electrons and, if so, how it would aect the bulk electron uid. a low sensitivity of the surface fermi arc states to disorder makes them promising candidates to sustain a surface electron uid in weyl semimetals. if this is indeed the case, the fermi arcs could realize not only the fermi level plumbing , but act as true aqueducts for the surface electron uid. because of the inevitable surface-bulk transitions and interactions, of course, such a surface electron uid should be necessarily coupled to the bulk one. in this study, we derive the hydrodynamic equations for the surface fermi arc states from the kinetic theory and phenomenologically describe the corresponding surface-bulk coupling. our principal nding is that the fermi arc electron liquid modies the boundary conditions for the bulk one. depending on the coupling parameters, the bulk ow in a slab of nite thickness could be noticeably altered and even enhanced near the surface. in addition, we study the surface collective modes in the hydrodynamic approximation. in agreement with the earlier studies , the presence of the fermi arcs is manifested in a strongly anisotropic dispersion relation of the surface plasmons. additionally, we nd that while the constant-frequency contours of the surface modes are given only by the elongated ellipses, the open hyperbolic contours correspond to the bulk modes hybridized with the surface excitations similarly to the usual semi-innite plasma . finally, there is also a gapless surface mode, which is related exclusively to the fermi arcs. while such a mode resembles a conventional surface acoustic plasmon , which also has a linear dispersion relation, the fermi arc mode is dierent and its frequency is determined by the surface dispersion relation. these qualitative eects can be potentially used to experimentally verify the realization of the electron hydrodynamics in weyl semimetals. our paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii, we introduce the phenomenological hydrodynamic model of the fermi arcs and discuss the coupling of the surface and bulk electron uids. the explicit realization of the coupling is given and the eects of the surface states on the hydrodynamic ow are studied in sec. iii. section iv is devoted to the investigation of the surface collective modes in the hydrodynamic approximation. our results are discussed and summarized in sec. v. technical details, including the derivation of the fermi arc hydrodynamic equations and some auxiliary formulas are given in appendices a and b, respectively. throughout this paper, we set the boltzmann constant kb =","Weyl semimetals exhibit unique characteristics such as Weyl nodes with non-zero topological charges and Fermi arcs in their surface states. These properties impact transport properties, with implications for phenomena like negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity. The energy dispersion of Fermi arc states is one-dimensional and linear. Although initially thought to be non-dissipative, scattering between surface and bulk states leads to dissipative transport. Furthermore, electron hydrodynamics has been observed in Weyl semimetals, with potential for hydrodynamic regimes and novel electron fluid behavior. The presence of Fermi arcs influences surface plasmons, which can be studied experimentally through various spectroscopic methods. The study explores hydrodynamic equations for Fermi arc states, their coupling to bulk electron fluid, and effects on bulk flow near surfaces. Finally, the research demonstrates anisotropic dispersion relations for surface collective modes, showcasing potential experimental verification of electron hydrodynamics in Weyl semimetals."
"in order to derive the hydrodynamic equations for the fermi arc quasiparticles, we start from the kinetic theory. as usual , the euler equation is obtained by calculating the appropriate moments of the kinetic equation. in the presence of an electric eld e, the latter reads as tf ee pf + v p f = i coll , where e is the electron charge, p = is the two-dimensional momentum of the surface quasiparticles, and i coll denotes the collision integral, whose eects on the fermi arcs will be discussed later. in the hydrodynamic regime, the distribution function describes local equilibrium, i.e., f = + exp  p p) t , where ys denotes the surface coordinate, s = labels the bottom and top surfaces, respectively, u is the fermi arc uid velocity, is the electric chemical potential, and t is temperature. for a slab of nite thickness ly, the coordinates of the top and bottom surfaces will be xed at y= ly and y+ = , respectively. here, for simplicity, we assume that the fermi arcs are strongly localized at the samples boundaries and, therefore, the dependence of the distribution function on the transverse coordinate can be modeled by the -functions. further, we assume that the weyl semimetal has a broken tr symmetry and contains two weyl nodes separated by b along the z direction in momentum space. then, assuming a simple model , the dispersion relation for the fermi arc states reads as p = svf px, where vf is the fermi velocity. the linear energy dispersion implies that the fermi arc quasiparticles have a constant velocity v p = p p = svf x parallel to the x axis. therefore, it is reasonable to assume that their hydrodynamical velocity u also points in the x direction. in other words, there is no hydrodynamic ow due to the fermi arcs in the z direction. of course, the same is true for the surface electric current, which can only ow along v p . we note that this is qualitatively dierent from the setup in ref. , where a diusive surface transport along the z direction was allowed. the derivation of the hydrodynamic equation for the fermi arc electron uid is given in appendix a. in the inviscid limit, which might be justied in the case of relatively small electron-electron collision times, the euler equation for the surface hydrodynamic velocity reads as sw vf + u x svf ! + en + u x svf ! ex = i s , where i s stems from the collision integral i coll and describes the surface-bulk transitions. the enthalpy and the fermion-number density of the fermi arc states in equilibrium are derived in appendix a their explicit expressions read as w = b vf  + t  , n = b vf . now, let us briey discuss the bulk hydrodynamics. in the absence of external magnetic elds and vorticity, the navierstokes equation for the quasiparticles in a weyl semimetal reads as t w v f u u  +  + p + ene + w v f u = isurf. here w = + p is the bulk enthalpy, is the bulk energy density, p is the pressure, u is the bulk uid velocity, n is the bulk fermion-number density, and are the shear and bulk dynamic viscosities, respectively. note that, in the global equilibrium state without background electromagnetic elds and with vanishing uid velocity, the energy density, the pressure, and the fermion-number density take the following explicit forms: = + t + t v f , p = , n =   + t  v f . in relativistic-like systems, the shear and bulk viscosities can be estimated as = wee/ and . in our study, we use the electron-electron collision time ee = /t , which is consistent with the experimental ndings in ref. . compared to the conventional navierstokes equation , eq. contains a few additional contributions. while the penultimate term on the left-hand side accounts for the charged nature of the electron uid and describes the electrical force, the term inversely proportional to the relaxation time is the hallmark feature of electron hydrody- namics in solids . it comes from the electron scattering on phonons and impurities and, as is clear from its explicit dependence on the uid velocity, breaks the galilean invariance. as for the term on the right-hand side of eq. , it describes the transfer of momentum between the surface and bulk uids. by taking into account that the fermi arcs are localized on the surface, it can be modeled as follows: isurf = x s= i s x. this inclusion of the source term in eq. implies that the boundary conditions for the electron uid should be modied. instead of the usual free-surface bcs, the uid velocity and its derivatives should satisfy the following bcs at y = ys: yux +  +  xuy = si s . additionally, the normal components of the electron uid velocity should vanish on both surfaces, i.e., uy = in order to illustrate the nontrivial eects of the fermi arcs, we will also consider the benchmark case, where the chiral shift is absent or directed normal to the surfaces of the slab. in such a simplied setup, there are no fermi arc surface states and the bcs for the bulk uid velocity take the standard no-slip form, i.e., ux = or the free-surface form, i.e., yux = since the fermi arc uid velocity aects only the x component of the bulk ow, the z component of the bulk uid velocity always satises the standard no-slip or free-surface bcs similar to those in eqs. or . as we argue below, this benchmark case is useful to identify the eects of the fermi arcs on the hydrodynamic ow without making any a priori assumptions about the state of the surface. it is worth noting that the navier-stokes equation should be amended by the energy conservation relation as well as the electric current continuity relation. while the latter has a profound eect on both the charge transport and collective excitations, the former is important only for the thermoelectric eects and can usually be neglected in electron transport . in general, however, the eect of the energy conservation on the electron hydrodynamics may become important when the uid velocity is not small compared to the speed of sound vsd (note that vsd is close to vf / in relativisticlike systems). therefore, in what follows, we will assume that |u| vsd and the energy conservation relation can be ignored. the electric current continuity relations for the surface and bulk states read as t s + j s = q s , t + j = x s= q s , respectively. here q s describes the electric charge transfer between the bulk and surface states of the semimetal. further, s = en  + su x /vf  is the surface electric charge density and = en is the bulk one. the surface and bulk electric currents are given by j s = svf s x, j = enu + e e , respectively. the explicit expressions for the fermi arc charge and current densities are derived in appendix a note that the expression for the bulk current includes the intrinsic conductivity , which was discussed in the holographic approach in refs. . while is important for the correct description of the normal ow in the presence of a nonzero chiral shift , it plays no role in the longitudinal ow. the last term in eq. corresponds to the anomalous hall eect , where b = b z is the chiral shift. by integrating eq. in the vicinity of the surfaces, we obtain the following boundary condition for the normal component of the bulk current: jy = sq s . formally, this implies that, because of the transitions between the surface and bulk states, the normal component of the bulk current does not vanish on the surface. before concluding this section, it is instructive to sum up the general features of the surface and bulk ows, as well as to reiterate the critical role that the bcs play in their interplay. the surface u x and bulk u uid velocities are determined by the hydrodynamic equations and , respectively. the bulk equation should be also supplemented by the appropriate bcs for the normal component of the uid velocity, see eq. , as well as the bcs for the tangential components, see eqs. or, in the absence of the fermi arcs, eqs. and . in addition, as we will see below, the study of the longitudinal ow requires specifying either the fermi arc uid velocity at some contacts or an explicit form of the transfer terms. in our study, we use the latter option that allows for a self-consistent determination of the surface uid velocity as well as the bulk ow. as for the collective excitations, the use of the continuity relations and will be needed in order to determine the evolution of the electric charge. in this connection, it should be emphasized that, because of the presence of the surface states, the normal component of the bulk electric current does not, in general, vanish at the boundary.","The section discusses the model for deriving hydrodynamic equations for fermi arc quasiparticles in a Weyl semimetal. The kinetic theory and Euler equation are used, with a focus on the electric field, collision integral, distribution function, and fermi arc states' dispersion relation. The hydrodynamic equations for surface and bulk fluids are derived, considering enthalpy, energy density, pressure, and dynamic viscosities. Boundary conditions and continuity relations for electric charge and current between bulk and surface states are also discussed, highlighting the effects of fermi arcs on the hydrodynamic flow."
"in this section, we investigate a steady hydrodynamic ow in a slab of nite width in the y direction and innite in the x and z directions. we assume that the slab is suciently thick so that the interaction between the fermi arcs on the opposite surfaces y+ = and y= ly is negligible and the arcs could be considered as independent. at the same time, the thickness should be small enough in order for the surface ow to have a noticeable eect on the net hydrodynamic ow. without loss of generality, we also assume that a uniform background electric eld is applied in the x direction. note that this is the same setup that we used in ref. , where, however, the eects of the fermi arcs were not taken into account. since the bulk electron uid couples to the surface states, the transfer term on the right-hand side in eq. plays an important role in the hydrodynamic ow. we model it as follows: i s = wu x v f sb + wux vf . here, the rst term describes the transitions from the surface to the bulk with the rate determined by the relaxation time sb. the second term corresponds to the inow from the bulk to the surface, where the rate is parametrized by a small numerical coecient . these terms are derived by using the relaxation time approximation in appendix a . for the surface to bulk transfer term, the relaxation time approximation might be indeed physical because the dissipation of the fermi arc states is primarily due to the surface to bulk scatterings . in the hydrodynamic picture, this corresponds to the outow into the bulk. as for the bulk to surface transfer term, it is estimated in a similar way. in general, the transfer terms in eq. can be viewed as the leading terms in the gradient expansion about the global equilibrium state. taking into account that the right-hand sides of the bulk navier-stokes and continuity equations are nonzero only at the surfaces of the slab, it is reasonable to take them into account only via the bcs. in particular, we will use eq. for the velocity on the surface and eq. for the normal component of the current. since the latter is not important for the longitudinal hydrodynamic transport, there is no need to specify the explicit form of the transfer term q s . therefore, the steady longitudinal ow in the bulk is described by the following equation: yux enex w v f ux = here, as in ref. , we omitted p in the ow equation. in view of the slabs geometry, there is no dependence on x and z. then, the general solution to eq. reads as ux = cexy + cexy env f ex w , where x = p w/(v f ) and the constants c and c are determined by the bcs. in particular, eq. takes the form syux = uxw vf "" w vf sb  senex + w vf sb # + enexw vf sb  senex + w vf sb  , where we used the following expression for u x obtained from eqs. and : u x = h vf enex wux i  senex + w vf sb  . it is instructive to consider the following two limiting cases: no transfer of electrons from the surface to the bulk sb and a very strong outow from the surface to the bulk sb in the rst case , we have u x = svf + swux enex , syux = wux vf . by noting that the velocity of the fermi arcs might be as large as vf , we could argue that the realization of the hydrodynamic regime for the surface quasiparticles is unlikely at large sb. also, in the limit , i.e., when the fermi arcs completely decouple, the bcs in eq. reduce to the usual free-surface ones and u x = svf . in the opposite limit, i.e., sb , we obtain u x = , syux = enex. in this case, there is a strong coupling between the surface and bulk uids leading to the vanishing fermi arc uid velocity. in addition, the boundary conditions for the bulk uid are modied signicantly and are aected by the electric eld and the chiral shift. in a general case, the expression for the uid velocity in the bulk of a weyl semimetal can be obtained in an analytical form by using the general solution in eq. and the bc in eq. . the corresponding expression is, however, rather cumbersome and not very informative. therefore, instead of presenting it here, we illustrate the key features of the ow, as well as the nontrivial eects of the fermi arcs by using a representative set of model parameters. in particular, we use the following material constants: vf = cm/s, b = nm, = s, e = , which are comparable to those in refs. . (note that the estimate for the electric permittivity e is based on the dielectric constants of tungsten and phosphorus .) by default, we also use the following values of other model parameters: = mev, t = k, ex = v/m, ly, = m, sb = ns, = in order to better clarify the role of the surface states, we start with the benchmark case without the fermi arcs on the surfaces of the slab. such a situation is realized naturally when the chiral shift is absent or when its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. in this special case, the bulk uid velocity in a weyl semimetal slab is given by ux = v f enex w  cosh cosh  , where = and correspond to the standard no-slip and free-surface bcs given in eqs. and , respectively. the corresponding prole of the longitudinal bulk ow velocity as a function of the y coordinate is shown in the left panel of fig. additionally, in the right panel of fig. , we show the dependence of the ow velocity integrated over the channel width, i.e., ux = r ly uxdy, on the slab width ly. now, let us discuss the case of hydrodynamic ow with fermi arcs on the surfaces. the longitudinal ow velocity ux and the ow velocity integrated over the channel width ux for a few values of the coupling parameter are shown in the left and right panels of fig. , respectively. as we see, the presence of the fermi arcs enhances the uid velocity near the boundaries when sb is suciently small and the transitions from the bulk to the surface, quantied by , are weak. this is in a drastic contrast to the case of the conventional no-slip or free-surface bcs presented in fig. the increase of both uid velocity and integrated uid ow velocity is caused by the fermi arc uid that tends to push the bulk one near the surfaces. as expected, the net enhancement of the ow is noticeable only for suciently small widths of the slab. it is interesting to note that the uid velocity prole is rather sensitive to the value of , which parametrizes the rate of transitions from the bulk to the surface. at the same time, the dependence of ux on is very weak. we checked that, with increasing sb and/or , the eect of the fermi arcs on the bulk hydrodynamic ow weakens and gradually changes to a suppression of the ow velocity near the surfaces. it should be noted that, as expected on the basis of eq. , the fermi arc uid velocity also grows with sb and could eventually reach large enough values so that the hydrodynamic approach for the surface states becomes unreliable. therefore, sb should remain suciently small to allow for the fermi arcs hydrodynamics. no-slip free-surface - - - - y/ly, uxm s no-slip free-surface - - - - ly/ly, ux ly m s fig. : the longitudinal ow velocity ux as a function of y and the longitudinal ow velocity integrated over the channel width, ux = r ly uxdy, as a function of the slab width ly . red solid and blue dashed lines correspond to the standard no-slip and free-surface bcs, respectively. - - - - - - - - y/ly, ux m s s   n =- =- =- - - - - - - ly/ly, ux ly m s  =   fig. : the longitudinal ow velocity ux as a function of the y coordinate and the longitudinal ow velocity integrated over the channel width, ux = r ly uxdy, as a function of the slab width ly for a few xed values of . to obtain the numerical results, we used the bc in eq. and set sb = ns.","The section examines steady hydrodynamic flow in a slab with finite width in the y direction and infinite in the x and z directions. The slab thickness allows for independent Fermi arcs on opposite surfaces. A uniform electric field is applied in the x direction. Bulk electron fluid couples to surface states, influencing the hydrodynamic flow. Transfer terms describe surface to bulk and bulk to surface transitions. Depending on the rate of these transitions, the effect of Fermi arcs on bulk fluid velocity can vary. Analyzing limiting cases without and with strong coupling between surface and bulk fluids provides insights into fluid behavior. Model parameters are used to illustrate key features of the flow. The presence of Fermi arcs enhances fluid velocity near boundaries when surface to bulk transitions are weak. The Fermi arc fluid velocity can impact the reliability of the hydrodynamic approach. Maintaining small values for the transition rate between surface and bulk regions is crucial for accurate Fermi arcs hydrodynamics."
"in this section, we study the eect of the fermi arcs on the collective modes in a semi-innite weyl semimetal in the hydrodynamic regime. in particular, we focus on the surface plasmons. we assume that the weyl semimetal is located in the upper half-space and the vacuum in the lower half . therefore, in the notation of sec. ii, s = +. henceforth, for simplicity, we omit the corresponding subscript in the fermi arc variables. previously, the fermi arc plasmons have been already studied in refs. . while ref. employs a simple phenomenological model, the authors of provide a more rigorous quantum-mechanical non-local approach. in this study, by following the approach similar to that used in refs. , we employ the hydrodynamic approximation without the retardation eects in maxwells equations. in this case, the oscillating electric potential is governed by poissons equation = e en, where n describes the deviations of the bulk fermion-number density from its equilibrium value, e = e+ is the electric permittivity of the system, and is the heaviside step function. the omission of the retardation eects is formally equivalent to setting c , which implies that the eects of oscillating magnetic elds can be neglected as well. by taking into account that the sought collective modes are localized on the surface of a weyl semimetal, we look for the solutions in the form of plane waves, x = x eit+ikr, where is the frequency, k= {kx, , kz} is the surface wave vector, and x is an oscillating hydrodynamic variable, e.g., , whose amplitude may depend on the y coordinate. following the arguments in refs. , we can neglect the eects of the energy conservation relation and set t = then, all oscillating thermodynamical variables can be expressed in terms of the bulk fermion-number density p = pn, w = wn, w = wn, where p = p n  = + t + t t = , w = w n  = p, w = w n  = . furthermore, by assuming a gradient ow, which is consistent with the omission of vorticity, the oscillations of the ow velocity can be expressed in terms of the velocity potential as follows: u = . then, the navier-stokes equation , where the surface-bulk transitions are accounted for by the bcs, takes the form i w v f + pn +  +  en w v f = in order to obtain the solution for , we will reexpress n and in terms of the velocity potential. by using the continuity relation , the oscillating electric charge density reads as n = in i e. this implies that the poisson equation inside the semimetal takes the form = ien e , where = . by making use of the last two equations, we can rewrite the navierstokes equation as "" w v f + pn i  +  en e + i w v f # = as is clear, the solution for that decreases in the bulk of the semimetal has the following form: = c eky + x j= c j ejy, where = q p + k (k iv f /w) p k iv f /w . here, we used the shorthand notation k = v f n p/w, which approaches v f / as t , and introduced the plasma frequency p = ev f n/. note that when are purely imaginary, the corresponding modes are hybridized surface-bulk excitations. when the bulk viscosity, dissipation, and the intrinsic conductivity are ignored, the expres- sion in eq. reads as = q p + kk k . as is clear, only + corresponds to a mode localized on the surface. having determined , we can now nd the expressions for the electric potentials both inside y > and outside y < the semimetal y> = ceky + ien e x j= c j ejy, y< = ceky. similarly to the uid ow, the bcs are also important for the surface collective modes. for the oscillating uid velocity, we impose the same bcs as for the ow in eqs. and , i.e., yux = ikxy = i, uy = y = as is clear from the above equations, the transfer term i in eq. should be set to zero. it is worth noting that, in a general case where the gradient approximation cannot be employed, i = in particular, an explicit form of the transfer term should be dened in order to solve the hydrodynamic equations for the longitudinal ow in sec. iii. the bcs for the electric potential have the following standard form: y> = y<, eyy> yy< = en, where the normal component of the oscillating electric eld e = has a jump connected with the singular contribution of the fermi arcs. according to ref. , the bulk states themselves should not induce a localized surface charge density. the oscillations of the surface fermion number density n can be obtained by using eqs. and , i.e., n = vf kxney> i yy> e. as for the oscillating fermi arc uid velocity u x , it can be obtained from the surface euler equation . another boundary condition can be derived from the y component of eq. after expressing in terms of n and utilizing the bc in eq. . the explicit form of this new bc reads as  p i n  +  yn = enyy> equations are sucient to reexpress all integration constants in eqs. , , and in terms of a single constant that is then xed by a normalization condition. also, after satisfying all the boundary conditions, one can determine the dispersion relations for the surface modes. as for the dispersion relations for the hybridized surface-bulk modes, they are obtained from eq. , where is a continuous variable . for the sake of simplicity, we neglect the eects of viscosity , dissipation , and intrinsic conductivity in the rest of this section. it is also instructive to start from the benchmark case without the fermi arcs on the surface of a weyl semimetal. then, after satisfying all bcs, eq. gives the following relation for the modes localized on the surface: k +  + + k  = p + e , where k and p are dened after eq. . the corresponding positive solution is given by = e p + e + kk + kk s p + e + kk / pe + e + kk e + kk + e p/ e + o(k ). note that the long-wavelength approximation is well dened and consistent with the nonretarded regime only at < ck. by taking into account the large value of c, the range of validity of the above result extends to rather small values of the wave vector, kp/c. the surface plasmon frequency in eq. qualitatively agrees with the results obtained in refs. . as we see, the spectrum of the surface plasmons is isotropic and has a nonzero gap. moreover, the value of the gap agrees with that obtained in ref. after setting e = now let us analyze the eect of the fermi arcs on the surface collective modes. because of a nonzero surface charge density in eq. , the characteristic equation becomes more complicated k + + ) = p b , where b = ebkx/. by solving the characteristic equation in the long-wavelength approximation, we obtain the following dispersion relations: =  b q b + e p  + o, = vf kx + kkb ep + o(k ). as in the simplied case without fermi arcs, the long-wavelength approximation is well-dened and consistent with the nonretarded regime for k/c, which is obviously the case for in eq. . in addition, as in usual metals , the hydrodynamic approximation is applicable even for the phase velocities of order vf . it is worth noting, however, that the landau damping, which is usually not captured in the hydrodynamic approach, could become relevant when the phase velocity of the surface mode with the frequency is smaller than the quasiparticle velocity vf . by making use of the approximate dispersion relation in eq. , we checked that this is not the case here because /kx > vf at suciently small values of kx. in general, however, the landau damping could provide an additional dissipation mechanism and should be included in a more rigorous treatment beyond the hydrodynamic approximation. the modes with can be identied with the surface plasmons. their frequencies are similar to those in eq. of ref. . it can be also veried that, in agreement with the analysis in ref. , the dispersion relations in eq. have discontinuities sign at kx = , namely limkz = |b|/. such discontinuities disappear at kz = it is important to note that, depending on the chiral shift, + at kx > could be signicantly larger than p + kk . then, by taking into account that the characteristic root dened in eq. becomes purely imaginary, the corresponding excitations should be identied with the hybridized surface-bulk modes and, henceforth, will be omitted. in contrast to the surface plasmons, which exist even in the absence of the fermi arcs, the mode with the dispersion relation in eq. originates exclusively from the surface states. it is somewhat reminiscent of the usual surface acoustic plasmon with a linear dispersion relation. however, the new mode stemming from the fermi arcs has a rather unconventional directional dependence. the frequencies of the surface plasmons and the fermi arc mode are presented in fig. , where the solid and dashed lines correspond to the numerical solutions of eq. and the approximate dispersion relations in eqs. and , respectively. black dots indicate the frequencies at which the surface modes hybridize with the bulk ones. in agreement with the previous analysis in ref. , we found three roots of the characteristic equation . two of them correspond to in eq. , which are related by the transformation and kk(the modes with < are not shown in the gures). the third solution describes a gapless fermi arc surface mode with the dispersion relation that, at leading order in small k, is approximately given by eq. . in addition, as one can see from fig. , the leading order approximate expressions and describe the collective modes rather well only when the wave vector is suciently small. in order to clarify the dependence of the surface mode frequencies on the wave vectors, we present the contour plots in momentum space for the positive frequency plasmon and the fermi arc surface mode in fig. as one can see from the left panel in fig. , the contour lines of the gapped surface plasmon are closed ellipses elongated in the direction dened by the fermi arcs dispersion relation, i.e., kx. the contours of the fermi arc mode are bell-shaped with the maximum at kz = by noting that the group velocities of the surface collective modes are given by the derivatives of their frequencies with respect to momenta, they can be represented by the vectors normal to the contour lines. then, as is clear from fig. , while there is a preferred direction dened by kx, the surface plasmons could also propagate radially similarly to the conventional surface plasmons with the frequency given in eq. . the gapless modes, on the other hand, always propagate in one direction, although there is a noticeable spreading, especially when the chiral shift is large. it should be emphasized that the constant-frequency contours for the plasmon modes obtained in this study are closed ellipses. this may appear to be qualitatively dierent from the open hyperbolic contours in refs. . we checked, however, that in the hydrodynamic approximation the latter correspond to the hybridized surface-bulk + - - vf kx/p p + - - vf x/p p fig. : the solutions for the surface collective modes in the

gapped surface plasmons and the blue lines describe the fermi arc surface mode. left and right panels show the results for kz = and kz = p/vf . black dots indicate the frequencies at which the surface modes hybridize with the bulk ones. fig. : the contour plots for the surface plasmon + and the fermi arc mode frequencies. the group velocity is normal to the contour lines and only the results for > are presented. modes with large frequencies. in addition, the open contours at large enough negative kx (or qy in the notation of ref. ) in fig. of ref. could, presumably, stem from the hybridization of the gapped and gapless modes. in general, we identify two qualitative features that could be used to analyze the eects of the fermi arcs on the surface collective modes in weyl semimetals. first of all, unlike the conventional surface plasmons with the frequency given in eq. , the fermi arc surface plasmons are described by a strongly anisotropic dispersion relation. also, unlike the gapped plasmon mode, which exists even in the absence of the surface fermi arc states, the new gapless collective mode appears only when the topological surface states are taken into account. therefore, if experimentally observed, the latter mode can be used to extract the information about the separation between the weyl nodes as well as the dispersion relation of the fermi arcs. experimentally, the anisotropy induced by the surface states can be probed using the near-eld optical spectroscopy , as well as the momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy . because of a possible interference between the surface modes from dierent pairs of weyl nodes , the most suitable materials are the weyl semimetals with a single pair of nodes. therefore, the magnetic heusler compounds with a broken tr symmetry might be promising candidates for the study of the surface collective modes.","The section discusses the effect of Fermi arcs on surface collective modes in a Weil semimetal. It focuses on surface plasmons and uses a quantum-mechanical non-local approach. The hydrodynamic approximation without the retardation effects in Maxwell's equations is employed to study oscillating electric potentials governed by Poisson's equation. Solutions for surface collective modes are found in the form of plane waves, with particular attention to hybridized surface-bulk excitations. The study highlights the directional dependence of these modes and provides dispersion relations for surface plasmons and Fermi arc modes. Anisotropic dispersion relations and the dependence on Fermi arcs are key features of the analyzed collective modes, offering insight into the separation between Weyl nodes. Experimental techniques like near-field optical spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy can be utilized to probe the anisotropy induced by surface states in Weil semimetals."
"in this paper, we proposed that the weyl semimetals with a broken tr symmetry may possess a hydrodynamic regime with a nontrivial interplay between the bulk electron uid and the uid formed by the surface fermi arc quasiparticles. the hydrodynamic equations for the latter are derived from the kinetic theory under the assumptions that the electron-electron scattering rate dominates over the electron-impurity and electron-phonon ones. further, we considered only the case where the hydrodynamic regime is achieved for both surface and bulk quasiparticles of the semimetal. in principle, however, the regime where the electron uid is formed only on the surface but not in the bulk could be also realized. such a scenario is likely to lead to unique features and deserves a separate study. in the proposed two-uid framework, we studied the role of the fermi arc uid on the bulk ow and on the spectrum of surface collective modes. for simplicity, we assumed that the surface uid is inviscid and couples to the bulk via the phenomenological inow and outow terms. the latter describe the fermi arc dissipation into the bulk and the transitions from the bulk to the surface states. we found that the fermi arcs modify the boundary conditions for the bulk electron uid. depending on the rate of the surface-bulk transitions as well as the value of the chiral shift, the bulk uid velocity could change signicantly near the boundaries. when the electrons are transferred to the surface at a greater rate than to the bulk, the bulk uid could be dragged by the surface one. such a regime, however, is characterized by large surface ow velocities at which the hydrodynamic description may become ill dened. on the other hand, an unconventional increase of the bulk uid ow near the boundaries is seen when the surface to bulk transitions dominate. such a manifestation of the fermi arc ow could be, in principle, observed via the decrease of the resistivity in samples of small width. in this study, we also demonstrated that the fermi arcs profoundly aect the surface collective modes in the hydrodynamic regime. in particular, we found that the dispersion relations of the surface plasmons become anisotropic in momentum space. this is in contrast to the conventional surface plasmons with the isotropic dispersion. the origin of the anisotropy is the dispersion relation of the surface fermi arc quasiparticles. in general, we identied two types of surface modes. while one of them is a gapped surface plasmon hybridized with the fermi arc oscillations, the other is a gapless mode triggered exclusively by the surface states. similarly to the usual surface acoustic plasmons , the gapless fermi arc mode has a linear dispersion relation, but it is sensitive to the sign of the wave-vector component along the direction of the fermi arc velocity. while our results agree qualitatively with those in refs. , we argue that the only true surface plasmon modes are those with the closed elliptic contours of constant frequency. in passing, let us discuss a few limitations of this study. the hydrodynamic model proposed in this paper is phenomenological and the underlying reasons for the uid formation have not been rigorously addressed. in addition, the reliable estimate of the hydrodynamic window, i.e., the parameter region where the electron uid can be formed, is still lacking for many experimentally realized weyl semimetals. in our analysis, we used a simplied model for the fermi arcs without any curvature. while we believe that the results will remain qualitatively the same for slightly curved arcs, the precise role of a nonzero curvature should be addressed in the future. in our study of the surface collective modes, we also neglected the viscosity and dissipation eects, which could be rigorously taken into account via nonlocal corrections as in ref. . in the future, it would be interesting to address also the eects of multiple pairs of weyl nodes and, therefore, several fermi arcs on the formation of the surface uid. such an investigation is beyond the scope of this study, however.","The text discusses the possibility of Weyl semimetals with broken TR symmetry exhibiting a hydrodynamic regime involving interactions between bulk electron fluid and surface Fermi arc quasiparticles. Hydrodynamic equations for the Fermi arc fluid are derived assuming electron-electron scattering dominates. The study explores scenarios where the electron fluid is present only on the surface or in both bulk and surface. Surface Fermi arcs impact bulk flow and modify surface collective modes, leading to anisotropic dispersion relations. The study identifies gapped and gapless surface modes influenced by Fermi arcs. Limitations include the need for a more rigorous understanding of fluid formation and consideration of viscosity/dissipation effects. Future research could investigate the effects of multiple pairs of Weyl nodes on surface fluid formation."

(for the derivation of the fermi arcs and their dispersion relation see, e.g., refs. [, , ].) the corresponding quasiparticle velocity is given by v p = p p = svf x, where x is the unit vector in the x direction. since the fermi arc quasiparticles move only along the x axis, it is reasonable to assume that the surface hydrodynamic motion is also possible only along that axis, i.e., u x. as we will show in appendix a , this is further justied by the fact that the fermi arc electric current can only ow along the x direction. in the case of small uid velocities, we can use the following expansion for the distribution function: f f pxu x f p , where f = + e p )/t is the distribution function of the fermi arc quasiparticles in global equilibrium. the euler equation for the fermi arc uid in order to derive the euler equation, we multiply eq. by the x component of the momentum px and integrate over px. [it should be noted that, because of the dispersion relation , there is no independent energy conservation equation.] the integration of the rst term in eq. leads to the following result: z dp pxtf = z dp pxt f pxu x f p ! = t x p,a sft v f li  e/t  x p,a t ft u x v f  li  + e/t   t + i  ln  + e/t  = t sf v f  + t  + u x svf ! , where we took into account the small uid velocity expansion in eq. and use the formulas in appendix b. further, p p,a denotes the summation over particles and antiparticles . it should be noted that and e e for holes and the limits of integration over px depends on the boundary label s, i.e., r s dpx. the overall coecient f is dened by the integration over the length of the fermi arc, i.e., f = z b b dpz = b . the integral with the term containing the electric eld in eq. can be calculated in a similar way. the result reads as e z dp px f = x p,a e exft vf ln  + e/t  + x p,a se u x exft v f ln  + e/t  = eexf vf + u x svf ! . the term with the spatial derivatives gives rise to the following result: z dp px  v p  f = x p,a svf x ft v f li  e/t  x p,a svf x ft u x v f  li  + e/t   t + i  ln  + e/t  = x f vf  + t  + u x svf ! . by collecting all contributions together, we nally arrive at the following euler equation for the fermi arc uid: sf v f  + t  + u x svf ! + ef vf + u x svf ! ex = i. transfer term here, we present the derivation of the transfer term on the right-hand side of the euler equation . in general, it may contain two dierent parts: one describing the surface to bulk transitions and the other describing the inow from the bulk. by recalling that the dissipation of the fermi arcs is primarily due to the surface to bulk scatterings , the rst part of i can be obtained by using the relaxation time approximation as follows: z dp px f f sb = z dp px pxu x sb f p = sb x p,a ft u x v f h li  + e/t   t + i  ln  + e/t i = u x sb f v f  + t  . the term describing the bulk to surface transitions, on the other hand, can be calculated by using the method in the supplemental material of ref. . its explicit form reads as b wux bsv f , where ux is the bulk uid velocity on the surface, w in the bulk enthalpy density, b is the dimensional coecient, and bs is the relaxation time describing bulk to surface transitions. it might be more convenient to parametrize the bulk inow in terms of a single overall coecient = b/. then, the nal expression for the transfer term i takes the form as in eq. in the main text. electric charge and current densities of fermi arcs for completeness, we present the explicit expressions for the electric charge and current densities for fermi arc quasiparticles. the corresponding expressions can be obtained by using the kinetic theory, i.e., = x p,a e z dp f = x p,a e z dp "" f pxu x f p # = x p,a sef  t svf ln  + e/t  + u x t sv f ln  + e/t  = ef vf + u x svf ! and j = x p,a e z dp v p f = x p,a esvf x z dp "" f pxu x f p # = x p,a vf x ef  t svf ln  + e/t  + u x t sv f ln  + e/t  = s x ef + u x svf ! , respectively. appendix b: polylogarithm functions in this appendix, we present several denitions and identities for the polylogarithm functions used in the derivation of the euler equation. by making use of the short-hand notation f = /, it is straightforward to derive the following formulas: z dp pnf = t n+ vn+ f lin+  e/t  , n , z dp pn f p = t n vn f lin  e/t  , n , where lin is the polylogarithm function. the polylogarithm functions of order n = and can be expressed in terms of elementary functions, i.e., li = + ex , li = ln . also, the following identities are useful li + li = , li li = x, li + li =  x +  , li + li + i  ln + ln   + ex =  ln  . b. yan and c. felser, annu. rev. condens. matter phys.

Fragmentation caused by gravitational instability in circumstellar discs can hinder this formation. Researchers studied marginally gravitationally unstable accretion discs using a thin disc model with detailed thermal and chemical processes. They considered different scenarios, like atomic and molecular flows, based on ultraviolet radiation or velocity differences between baryon and dark matter. The fragmentation condition depends on accretion rate and disc characteristics, with simulations suggesting fragmentation is likely during supermassive star formation."
"discoveries of dozens of quasars at high redshift z demonstrate the very existence of supermassive black holes as massive as min less than a billion years after the big bang (e.g., venemans et al. ; matsuoka et al. ; see also gallerani et al. for a review), in- cluding the most distant one with mat redshift z = (ba nados et al. ). although the origin of those bhs is still a mystery, short available time for their growth seems to favor massive seed bhs (see, e.g., volonteri ; haiman for a review). remnant bhs of population iii stars with m are one of the candidates for such seeds (e.g., madau & rees ). they can grow smbhs in the available time if either with continuous accretion at the eddington limit or with short episode of super-eddington growth. in reality, e-mail: r.matsukoba@astr.tohoku.ac.jp however, the bhs growth can easily be hindered by its own radiative feedback (milosavljevi c et al. ; park & ricotti ; sugimura et al. ; orono et al. ). an alterna- tive and attractive pathway for seed bh formation is via the so-called direct collapse , where a supermassive star with mcollapses into a bh with a similar mass by general relativistic instability (umeda et al. ; woods et al. ; haemmerl e et al. ). here, smss are supposed to form from a primordial gas in some peculiar sites. unlike in ordinary rst star formation, which is driven by h cooling (see, e.g., bromm & larson ; glover for a review), h is dissociated by strong ex- ternal far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby galaxies and the contraction of clouds is solely caused by h atomic cooling in the most intensively studied channel for sms for- mation (omukai ; omukai et al. ; shang et al. ; regan et al. ; sugimura et al. ). such clouds con- tract almost isothermally at k without experiencing vigorous fragmentation. the protostar formed at the centre subsequently accretes the gas at a high rate of myr the authors arxiv:v dec r. matsukoba et al. due to high temperature (latif et al. ; inayoshi et al. ; becerra et al. ; chon et al. ). such rapidly accreting protostar inates greatly in radius with eective temperature of several k and grows supermassive with mavoiding ionization radiation feedback on the ac- cretion ow , before collapsing by general relativistic instability. in addition to the above scenario for sms formation, hi- rano et al. recently proposed another channel where the suppression of h cooling is not always required. they considered a pristine cloud in a halo with higher than the average velocity dierence between the dark matter and the baryon generated before the recombination epoch at z (tseliakhovich & hirata ; fialkov et al. ; schauer et al. ). as a result of enhanced eective jeans mass by such streaming motions, the formed protostar in the halo accretes a gas with a high rate of myr the star eventually grows to min their calculation. protostellar ionization feedback is suppressed as long as the accretion rate higher than myr is maintained . once the accretion rate falls below this value for sometime, however, the radiation feed- back may become signicant and eventually terminate the stellar growth. adopting a simple sporadic accretion history with repeating burst and quiescent phases, sakurai et al. showed that the protostar contracts to the main se- quence and ionization feedback becomes active if the qui- escent phase exceeds yrs. such time variations would be caused by clump formation in the circum-stellar disc, which is formed due to the nite angular momentum of the cloud. in fact, numerical simulations of sms forma- tion found a sign of disc fragmentation by gravitational instability and result- ing accretion variation although their spatial resolution and chemical/thermal modeling are not good enough to draw denitive conclusions. inayoshi & haiman and latif & schleicher studied the gravitational stability of circum-stellar discs in the process of sms formation by way of the steady thin disc model , and claimed that the disc becomes unstable and fragmentation occurs for a disc accreting at the typical rate of myr in their calculation, however, simplied treatment of thermal mod- eling is adopted without solving detailed chemical reactions: latif & schleicher assumed that the accretion ow is composed of h at the outer boundary and becomes atomic h once the temperature exceeds k, while inayoshi & haiman assumed that the gas is always in the atomic state and the temperature is determined by the balance be- tween the viscous heating and the hfree-bound emission cooling. their conclusion needs to be justied by more de- tailed modeling. in this paper, we construct models for one-dimensional steady accretion discs by solving non-equilibrium chemical and thermal evolution and investigate their gravitational stability. while the works by inayoshi & haiman and latif & schleicher are limited to a typical accretion rate of myr, here we also study the cases with dif- ferent values of the accretion rate and central stellar mass. the paper is organized as follows. we describe our disc model and stability criterion in section we then present the obtained disc structures and the result for the stability analysis in section discussion and conclusion are given in section appendices are for the details of radiative and chemical processes.","Dozens of quasars at high redshift z indicate the presence of supermassive black holes shortly after the Big Bang. The origin of these black holes remains a mystery, but theories suggest they could have originated from remnant black holes of Population III stars or through direct collapse of supermassive stars into black holes. Different scenarios for supermassive star formation are discussed, including one where the suppression of hydrogen cooling is not necessary. Models for one-dimensional steady accretion discs are constructed to study gravitational stability, with a focus on non-equilibrium chemical and thermal evolution.

"basic framework we construct the one-dimensional axisymmetric and steady model for an accretion disc feeding the central star under a given central stellar mass and accretion rate. the disc is assumed to rotate at the keplerian angular velocity = r gm r , where r, g and mare the radius, the gravitational con- stant and the central stellar mass, respectively. we assume the disc is marginally gravitationally unstable and the an- gular momentum is transported by the spiral arms. ther- mal and chemical evolution in the ow is calculated as in sections and . we describe the angular momentum transport by the -viscosity prescription (shakura & sun- yaev ) and judge disc fragmentation from the required value of -parameter . for a marginally unstable disc, toomres q-value is q = cs g , where cs is the sound velocity and is the surface density, as a result of the angular momentum transfer by the spiral arms . an- other possible mechanism of the angular momentum trans- fer is via the turbulent viscosity. according to the results shown in section , however, the actual -value required is always larger than the typical value for the turbulent viscos- ity ( for magnetorotational instability; e.g., bai & stone ). this means that the turbulent viscosity alone cannot maintain the disc in a gravitationally stable state and the disc eventually settles in a marginally unstable state where the angular momentum is transferred due to the spi- ral arms. from the condition q = , the surface density is obtained as = cs g . the sound velocity is cs = s kbt mh , where is the specic heat ratio, kb is the boltzmann con- stant, t is the gas temperature, is the mean molecular weight and mh is the mass of a hydrogen nucleus. the gas mass density is given by = h , where the scale height h characterizing the thickness of the disc is estimated from vertical hydrostatic balance: h = cs . mnras , fragmentation of discs around smss the radial velocity is related to the mass accretion rate m as: vr = m r .","The text describes a one-dimensional axisymmetric and steady model for an accretion disc feeding a central star with a given mass and accretion rate. The disc is assumed to rotate at the Keplerian angular velocity, with angular momentum transported by spiral arms. Thermal and chemical evolution in the flow is calculated, and angular momentum transport is described using the alpha-viscosity prescription. For a marginally unstable disc, the Toomre's q-value is determined, and it is found that turbulent viscosity alone cannot maintain the disc in a gravitationally stable state. The surface density and sound velocity are calculated based on specific equations, and the radial velocity is related to the mass accretion rate."
"we calculate the time evolution of internal energy ein (per unit mass) in the ow by solving the energy equation, dein dt = p d dt   + , where p is the pressure, is the heating rate per unit mass and is the cooling rate per unit mass. the internal energy and the temperature are related as ein = kbt mh . the pressure is given by the ideal-gas equation of state, p = kbt mh . we consider viscous heating, continuum cooling, h molecular and li atomic line cooling and chemical cooling as the heating and cooling processes. the viscous heating rate per unit mass is vis = , where is the kinematic viscosity. for consistency with the assumption that the disc is steady and rotating at the ke- plerian velocity, the kinematic viscosity must satisfy the re- lation = m , from the angular momentum conservation. in our model, the kinematic viscosity is determined so that the surface density satises equation for a given accretion rate. the continuum radiation processes considered are h free-bound emission, hfree-bound emission, hfree-free emission, h free-free emission, h-h collision induced emission and h-he cie . the continuum cooling rate in optically thin regime cont,thin is given by sum of equation in appendix a over all the processes. smoothly connecting the optically thin and thick limits, the continuum cooing rate in both regimes is given as cont = cont,thin + p + rp , where p is the planck mean optical depth, given by p = p , with the planck mean opacity p calculated as in appendix a the h-line cooling rate is given by multiplying the value in the optically thin regime h,thin with the line-averaged escape probability esc: h = esch,thine , where = pr is the eective optical depth for continuum radiation. we use tting functions for esc from fukushima et al. and for thin,h from glover , respec- tively. as chemical cooling/heating processes, we consider those associated with h ionization/recombination and h dissociation/formation. the li cooling rate including line self-absorption eect escli,thin is given by equation b (see appendix b). considering also the continuum absorption, we obtain the li cooling rate li = escli,thine . the chemical cooling rate is chem =  h dy dt h dy dt  nh , where h = ev and h = ev are the binding energies. the chemical fraction of species i, y, is dened by the number fraction relative to hydrogen nuclei: y = n nh , where n and nh are the number densities of species i and hydrogen nuclei, respectively. the latter is related to the mass density of the gas as nh = mh , where yhe = the number fraction of he relative to hydrogen nuclei. we do not include radiative heating by the central star in our calculation. we estimated it under the assumption of optically-thin irradiation at the disc midplane and found it is generally lower than the viscous heating rate even at the eddington luminosity because the coupling between the stellar radiation and disc is very inecient due to the ge- ometrical dilution of radiation and transparency of the disc (typically - in the case of atomic ow and - in the case of molecular ow at au, where the discs tend to be most gravitationally unstable; see figs. c and c). the radiative heating does not change the disc structure except in the outer regions in the case of low accretion rate myr in this case, the stellar radi- ation heating can be comparable to the viscous heating and raises the temperature to k. although this somewhat stabilizes this part of the disc, the disc remains unstable (see section ) as in the case without stellar radiation. we thus expect that the eect of stellar radiation heating does not change our conclusion on disc fragmentation.","The text discusses the calculation of the thermal evolution in a gas flow, considering various heating and cooling processes such as viscous heating, continuum cooling, molecular and atomic line cooling, and chemical cooling. The relationship between internal energy, temperature, and pressure is explored, along with viscosity and radiation processes. Chemical reactions related to ionization, dissociation, and formation are also considered. Radiative heating by the central star is found to be inefficient compared to viscous heating. Overall, the study suggests that stellar radiation heating does not significantly impact disc fragmentation conclusions."
"we take into account the chemical reactions among the following ve h-bearing species, h, h, h+, hand e, sum- marized in table c . all the reactions are paired with their reverse reactions. we solve non-equilibrium kinetic equations for h, h, h+ and e, while hfraction is calculated from the equilibrium between the forward and reverse reactions of reactions , and in we include the collisional dissociation of h by atomic helium impact for consistency with the expres- sion used for the critical density of h, where the helium impact is also considered. mnras , r. matsukoba et al. table c we assume he to be all neutral with fractional abundance yhe = as our temperature range is limited below k. we also assume that li remains neu- tral with yli = since they are still dominantly atomic in the calculated range and the small amount of li ions does not aect thermal evolu- tion at all. h photodissociation and hphotodetachment by external radiation are not included. because the num- ber density is larger than cm in our calculation range and the shielding of far-uv radiation is eective due to the large column density, the collisional dissociation works more eciently than the dissociation due to external far-uv ra- diation. the eect of hphotodetachment is also negligible because h formation via the three body reaction is more eective than the hchannel at such high densities as con- sidered in this work.","Chemical reactions involving various hydrogen-bearing species including H, H₂, H⁺, and e⁻ are considered in this study. Non-equilibrium kinetic equations are solved for these species, with H fraction calculated based on equilibrium between forward and reverse reactions. The collisional dissociation of H by atomic helium impact is included for consistency with critical density calculations. Helium is assumed to be neutral with a fractional abundance due to the limited temperature range. Lithium is also assumed to be neutral as it remains atomic dominantly within the range. Photo-dissociation and photo-detachment of H by external radiation are not considered due to efficient collisional dissociation at high densities in the calculation range. The impact of H⁻ photo-detachment is deemed negligible as H formation via three-body reactions is more effective in high-density conditions."
"we judge whether the disc fragments or not from the vis- cosity parameter = c s = g m c s , where we have used equations and for the last ex- pression. we here adopt > as the fragmentation condi- tion following the results of zhu et al. , who claimed that discs fragment when the -value corresponding to the angular momentum transfer by gravitational torque exceeds unity from two-dimensional numerical simulations of proto- planetary discs. in other words, there is an upper limit on the angular momentum transported by the spiral arms and if more matter is accumulated than the disc can extract its angular momentum, the disc will fragment. in contrast, if < throughout, the disc remains stable and the angular momentum is transported by the gravitational torque.","The viscosity parameter, cs, is used to determine if a disc fragments or remains stable. Fragmentation is determined by adopting a condition where the -value exceeds unity, as suggested by Zhu et al. From two-dimensional numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs, it was found that when the angular momentum transfer by gravitational torque exceeds a certain limit, the disc fragments. If the condition is met, the disc is stable and angular momentum is transported by gravitational torque."

". disc structures the disc structure for a molecular ow is shown in fig. in the case with accretion rate m = myr for dierent central stellar masses m= , , , and m. soon after the beginning of calculation, the temperature near the outer boundary quickly converses to the thermal equilibrium value, which is higher for the higher accretion mnras , r. matsukoba et al. a b c d -

It discusses how temperature changes lead to transitions between molecular and atomic phases, affecting chemical fractions and heating/cooling rates. The critical radius for disc fragmentation is analyzed, showing that fragmentation occurs in the outer region of high accretion rate cases and is influenced by temperature variations and accretion rates. The stability of the disc is dependent on the interplay between temperature profiles, accretion rates, and central stellar masses."
"seed black hole formation by the direct collapse and its subsequent growth is one viable scenario for the supermas- sive black hole formation in the early universe. in this framework, a small protostar is rst formed by the grav- itational collapse of a cloud, and grows to supermassive star by rapid accretion, and nally the sms collapses by general relativistic instability into a seed bh. in this paper, we have investigated gravitational instability of the discs around rapidly accreting protostars with mass m at rate myr by way of the steady -disc model with detailed treatment of chemical and thermal processes. we have considered two possible compositions of the inow, i.e., mostly atomic and molecular gases, at the disc outer boundary. we have constructed marginally gravitationally stable disc structure. by comparing the required value of viscosity parameter to maintain such structure and the possible maximum value of unity, we have judged the grav- itational instability of discs. in the case of atomic ows, we have found the following two types of disc structures depending on the accretion rate. at high rate , the gas composition remains atomic in the optically thin part with temperature of k, set by the hfree-bound emission. at lower rate, in con- trast, the compositional transition to the h phase occurs at some radius and h collision-induced emission dominates the cooling further inward. in both cases, once the disc be- comes optically thick, the temperature jumps up to > k and the gas is ionized. the discs are gravitationally unsta- ble if the accretion rate is higher than myr regardless of the central stellar mass. if the inow is mainly composed of a molecular gas, the h-line cooling keeps the temperature below k in outer part of the disc although the temperature grad- ually increases inward. with the accretion rate higher than myr, the h dissociation occurs while the disc is still optically thin and the temperature jumps up to k. with a lower rate, the gas remains in the molecular form until it becomes optically thick to the h collision-induced absorption. for a given accretion rate and stellar mass, such disc is always unstable at suciently large radius . this critical radius is au for myr de- mnras , fragmentation of discs around smss pending on the stellar mass, but decreases abruptly by an order of magnitude with higher accretion rates. based on the analysis above, let us briey discuss the possibility of disc fragmentation during sms formation in dierent formation sites, whose main component can be ei- ther atomic or molecular. first, for a star forming from the atomic gas, the accretion rate can be estimated as m = c s,col g =  cs,col km s  myr . where cs,col is the eective sound speed in the collapsing cloud including also the eect of turbulence, magnetic eld etc., and is a factor that reects the manner of collapse: for dynamically collapsing cores and for quasi- statically collapsing cores . according to nu- merical simulations for the collapse induced by atomic cool- ing , cs,col is km s, which indicates the occurrence of disc fragmentation largely de- pends on detailed manner of the collapse. second, for the molecular-gas case, where smss are supposed to form in sites with large streaming velocity between baryon and dark matter, whether the size of the discs is bigger or smaller than the critical one matters. in hirano et al. s numerical simulations, disc radii are au in most of the cases, while the accretion rates uctuate be- tween myr and myr thus, the discs are larger than the critical radius and expected to fragment be- fore the central stellar mass reaches m, which is actually the case as found by hirano et al. . if a disc fragments into multiple clumps, the accretion onto the central protostar becomes episodic with repeat- ing bursts accompanying falls of the clumps and interven- ing quiescent phases. with a quiescent phase longer than the kelvin-helmholtz timescale, the protostar contracts to a main-sequence star and starts emitting ionization pho- tons, which can terminate further growth of the central star . for quantitative modeling of the accretion-rate variability, hydrodynamical simulations incorporating with the chemical and thermal networks are awaited. the outcome of the disc fragmentation studied here might be supermassive binary stars, which can be detectable by future gravitational wave observations . for example, if an equal mass binary system with m forms and ends up with the merger of the remnant bhs with the same mass, the emitted gravitational waves would be detectable by deci-hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory and laser interferometer space antenna (lisa: amaro-seoane et al. ) up to redshift z and , respectively. in this work, we have adopted the critical -value of unity as the condition for disc fragmentation in light of nu- merical simulations of protoplanetary discs . fragmentation condition is, however, still in dispute (cf., gammie ; meru & bate ; rice et al. ; taka- hashi et al. ). furthermore, it is not clear whether the condition obtained for protoplanetary discs is applicable to the those around smss. if the critical value of becomes smaller, discs will fragment more easily. in particular, for atomic ows with low accretion rate , the cold inner regions by h cooling may also become gravitationally unstable if a smaller critical -value is adopted. here the disc structure is obtained under the thin disc approximation. to check this, we calculated the aspect ratio h/r for all the cases considered in this paper and found that in most cases it falls in the range , justifying this approximation. owing to the dependence h/r r/m/ , however, the thin disc approximation becomes worse for lower mand larger r. in fact, the ratio h/r becomes in our smallest mass case considered m= maround the outer edge of the disc at au. in reality, however, the disc size would be smaller than our adopted value of au in such an early stage since the disc size increases with time accompanying the accretion of large angular mo- mentum material originally located at the outer part of the parental dense core. considering uncertainties above, further studies are needed to conclude whether smss actually form or not. we plan to perform hydrodynamics simulations that follow the formation of smss from the collapse of cores, where the disc fragmentation and subsequent evolution of fragments sup- posedly play an important role. acknowledgments the authors would like

the rosseland mean opacity is r = i= i, b t d b t d , where the sum is over all the absorption and scattering pro- cesses. the photon trapping eect becomes remarkable only when the disc is nearly optically thick. in such condition, the chemical fractions are approximately in the equilibrium values, which are given by saha-boltzmann equations. for example, among species a, b, and c for which a

level populations from the statisti- cal balance among ten levels. photon trapping eect in large column density cases is taken into account by way of the escape probability formalism (e.g. omukai ). the level energies and the spontaneous ra- diative decay rate are taken from klevas et al. . we only consider electron impact as the collisional excitation process and its rate coecients are taken from osorio et al. . the cooling rate including the line self-absorption escli,thin = nnlli/ is calculated for given sets of the temperature t, the electron number density n and the lithium column density n. we found the re- sults are excellently reproduced by the interpolation in the form of lli = l + n escllte , where l is the cooling function in the low-density limit and escllte is the cooling rate per lithium atom in the lte case with the photon trapping eect included, which are pre- sented in table b as a function of the temperature t and the column density parameter n = n/ p kbt/mli, where n is the column density of lithium and mli is the mass of a lithium atom. the error in this approximation is generally less than one percent and at most several per- cent in the presented range even in the worst case at high temperatures and the electron number densities. appendix c: chemical reactions our chemical network consists of reactions - in table c, including both forward and reverse reactions. the forward reaction coecients are presented in the table. the reverse reaction coecient k c for collisional re- actions , a + b c + d, whose forward reaction coecient is kc, is given from the law of mass action as k c = kc/k , with equilibrium constant k = h nn nn i calculated by the saha-boltzmann equation. the reverse reaction coe- cients of radiative reactions ,

Older clusters are more concentrated than younger clusters, with their structure represented by characteristic radius (rs), mass (ms), and X-ray temperature of the intracluster medium (TX) forming a tight correlation. Clusters are shown to move along a fundamental plane as they evolve, indicating that the ICM temperature is determined by the formation time of individual clusters. The distribution of clusters on the plane is related to the intrinsic scatter in the halo concentration-mass relation, with implications for understanding cluster dynamics without assuming virial equilibrium. The fundamental plane can also be utilized for calibrating cluster masses."
"clusters of galaxies are the most massive objects in the universe. since the fraction of baryons in clusters is not much different from the cosmic mean value, dark matter accounts for most of the mass of clusters . thus, the structure of the clusters is mainly determined by the halos of dark matter, or the dark halos. cold dark matter cosmology predicts that more massive halos form later. thus, clusters form after galaxies do. however, the denition of the formation is not obvious, galaxies , , ; doi:/galaxies www.mdpi.com/journal/galaxies arxiv:v dec galaxies , , of because halos are continuously growing through mergers and accretion from their environments. a current trend may be associating the formation time with the internal structure of dark halos. the density distribution of dark halos is well-represented by the navarrofrenkwhite density prole : dm = cc , where r is the clustercentric radius, rs is the characteristic radius, and c is the critical density of the universe. the normalization of the prole is given by c. the characteristic mass ms is dened as the mass inside rs and the characteristic density is written as s ms/(r s). the mass prole of the nfw prole is written as m = ccr s  ln  + r rs  r r + rs  . another commonly dened characteristic radius of clusters is that based on the critical density c; it is represented by r, which is the radius of a sphere of mean interior density c, where is the constant. the mass within ris written as m= r . the radius when = or r is often called the virial radius. since it is generally difcult to observationally study cluster properties out to r r, = is also used as a representative value. the ratio c= r/rs is called the halo concentration parameter and c> for = and for clusters. navarro et al. pointed out that the characteristic parameters of the nfw prole (e.g., s and c) reect the density of the background universe when the halo was formed. this means that, since older halos formed when the density of the universe was higher, they tend to have larger characteristic densities s and become more concentrated with larger c. this issue has been addressed in many studies, especially by n-body simulations . these studies have indicated that the halo structure is determined by their mass-growth history. the inner region (r < rs) of current halos develops in the early fast-rate growth phase when the halos grow rapidly through matter accumulation. their outer region (r > rs) is formed in the subsequent slow-rate growth phase in which halos grow slowly through moderate matter accumulation. during this phase, the inner region is almost preserved. thus, halos form inside-out. the formation time of a halo can be dened as the transition time from the fast-rate growth phase to the slow-rate growth phase. this shift of the growth phase is largely associated with the decrease in the average density of the universe in the cdm cosmology. there are a few specic denitions of the formation time that well represent the transition time. one is the time at which the mass of the main progenitor was equal to the characteristic mass ms of the halo at its observed redshift zobs . the formation redshift corresponding to the formation time should be larger than zobs, or z f zobs. for a given zobs, clusters with a larger z f have a larger s and c. moreover, numerical simulations have shown that clusters are dynamically evolving systems and such evidence is often found in their outskirts. in fact, the ambient material is continuously falling toward clusters, which creates surfaces around clusters. for example, the outskirt proles of dark matter halos can become extremely steep over a narrow range of radius . this features in the density proles are caused by splashback of collisionless dark matter on its rst apocentric passage after accretion . accretion of collisional gas toward clusters also creates more precisely, the boundary radius between the inner and outer regions is a few times rs . galaxies , , of discontinuities in the form of shock fronts in their outskirts . these discontinuities mean that clusters are neither isolated nor in an equilibrium state. in this review, we rst introduce the fundamental plane we discovered, and its implications for structure formation of the universe. in particular, we show that clusters in general have not achieved virial equilibrium in contrast with conventional views. then, using the fundamental plane, we discuss that a scaling relation can be explained without assuming virial equilibrium. we also show that the fundamental plane can be used for mass calibration. we assume a spatially-at cdm cosmology with m = , = , and the hubble constant of h = km s mpc","Clusters of galaxies, being the most massive objects in the universe, have their structure primarily determined by dark matter halos. Cold dark matter cosmology predicts that more massive halos form later, with clusters forming after galaxies. The density distribution of dark halos is well-represented by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. Halo concentration parameters reflect the density of the universe when the halo was formed, with older halos tending to have larger characteristic densities. Halo structure is influenced by mass-growth history, with inner regions developing rapidly and outer regions forming more slowly. Formation time of a halo is associated with the transition from fast to slow growth phases. Numerical simulations show that clusters are dynamically evolving systems with continuous material falling towards them, creating unique density profiles and shock fronts in their outskirts. It is suggested that clusters have not reached virial equilibrium as traditionally believed, and a scaling relation can be explained without the assumption of virial equilibrium. The fundamental plane discovered can be used for mass calibration in a spatially-flat cold dark matter cosmology."
"the hot intracluster medium is distributed in the potential well of dark halos. since the x-ray emission from the icm is proportional to the square of the density, it mainly comes from the central region of the cluster where the density is high. thus, the observed x-ray temperature tx represents that of the central region and should reect the gravitational potential there. since the potential is determined by rs and ms, we can expect some relation among tx, rs, and ms. based on this motivation, fujita et al. analyzed massive clusters in the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble observational sample . for these clusters, rs and ms had been obtained from the joint analysis of strong lensing observations with -band hubble space telescope observations and weak-lensing observations mainly with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope . the x-ray temperature had been obtained with chandra . temperatures are estimated for a cylindrical volume dened by the projected radii r = kpc to avoid the inuence of cool cores. figure a shows the data distribution in the space. as can be seen, the data are distributed on a plane. the plane is described by ra s mb s tc x = const., with a = + , b = + , and c = + . figure b shows the cross-section of the plane; the dispersion of the data around the plane is very small and is only + dex (all uncertainties are quoted at the condence level unless otherwise mentioned). in figure c, error bars for individual clusters are shown. in the vertical direction , we show the temperature errors of individual clusters. in the horizontal direction, the errors of rs and ms are strongly correlated, and we display them as a single bar. this means that we draw a bar connecting (ru s , mu s ) and (rl s, ml s) for each cluster, where the superscripts u and l are the upper and the lower limits, respectively. we note that, when we calculate the plane parameters, we properly account for the correlation for each cluster using the joint posterior probability distribution of the nfw parameters . thus, the actual error is not represented by a single bar in a precise sense. figure shows the direction of the plane normal p in the space . the contours are drawn considering the errors and show that the direction is inconsistent with the prediction of a simplied dimensional analysis or tx ms/rs. we note that it is meaningless to discuss cluster distribution in the space of , where r, m, and tx are their current values. although the clusters form a plane in that space, it is just the obvious relation of m = r / r regardless of tx . the fundamental plane has been reproduced by numerical simulations. figure shows the results of music n-body/hydrodynamical simulations . these simulations do not include radiative cooling or non-gravitational feedback by active galactic nuclei and supernovae . the mass resolutions for the dark-matter particles that for the gas particles are mdm = h mand msph = h m, respectively, where the hubble constant is written as h = h km s mpc and h = . the gravitational softening is set to be h kpc for the both gas and dark-matter particles in high-resolution regions. we chose all clusters at z = with m > h mregardless of dynamical state. in this analysis, we included the core other fundamental planes of clusters with different combinations of three parameters have also been studied . galaxies , , of because these simulations are non-radiative and thus do not present cool-core features. the absolute position of the plane is very close to that of the clash observational data . figure shows that the plane angle for the music sample is consistent with the clash data at the % condence level. p log log log p p p log log log figure black dots are the clash data in the space of , log, log), where rs = kpc, ms = m, and tx = kev are the sample geometric averages of rs, ms, and tx, respectively. the orange plane is the best t of the data. the orange plane is translucent, and the grayish points are located below the plane. the lengths of the pins show the distance to the plane. the red bars show typical errors of the data. the arrow p shows the direction to which the data distribution is most extended, and the arrow p is perpendicular to p on the plane. the cross-section of the plane in . the large black dots are the clash data, and the small red dots are the music results shown in figure the latter is projected on the pp plane determined for the former. the direction p is the plane normal. note that the scales of the vertical and horizontal axes are different. the same as but error bars for individual clusters are included. the viewing angle is changed so that the relation between the error bars and the plane is easily seen . galaxies , , of ||  virial music nf fb fb ssol figure the angle of the plane normal p in the space of ;

The plane is determined using observational data and simulations, showing a tight correlation among these parameters. The analysis includes clusters from the cluster lensing and supernova survey with Hubble observations. The plane's orientation is inconsistent with simple dimensional analysis predictions. Numerical simulations confirm the existence of the Fundamental Plane, even without including radiative effects or non-gravitational feedback. The study suggests that radiative cooling and feedback have minimal impact on the Fundamental Plane at the scale analyzed."
"fujita et al. explained the origin of the fundamental plane using an analytic similarity solution developed by bertschinger . this solution treats spherical collapse of an overdense region in the einsteinde sitter universe and subsequent matter accretion onto the collapsed object. in the solution, matter proles are represented by non-dimensional radius, , density d, pressure p, and mass m. the solution has a constant called the entropy constant. pdm/ = const , galaxies , , of where = / is the adiabatic index. the non-dimensional parameters are related to dimensional density , pressure p, and mass m: = hd , p = hp , m = hr tam , where rta is the maximum radius that a mass shell reaches , h t is the density of the background universe, and t is the cosmological time. the non-dimensional radius is given by = r/rta. we note that the similarity solution describes the matter prole in the region where the matter is later accreted (say, r > rs). the solution was originally developed for objects totally composed of baryons, thus , p, and m are for the gas. however, the non-dimensional proles (d, p, and m) are not much changed, even if objects are mostly composed of dark matter . thus, the proles , p, and m can be regarded as the values for the gas as long as we do not discuss the normalizations. although the solution is constructed for the einsteinde sitter universe, it well-reproduces the structure of objects except for the outermost region even for a cdm universe, because the inner region was established when the background density of the universe was large . from equations and , we obtain p/m/ a ita , where aita = rita/t/ ita and is time-independent. here, rita and tita are the turnaround radius and the turnaround time (the time when the radius reaches turnaround radius) of the overdense region, respectively. the evolution of the overdense region is described by the conventional spherical collapse model. thus, it should follow the spectrum of initial density perturbations of the universe and the mass of the overdense region mita has scaling relations of rita m/ ita , tita m/ ita , where n, the spectral index, is of the initial density perturbations and n is expected around the mass scales of clusters . here, we emphasize that equation is applied to the overdense region, and not to the entire cluster, because we separately treat the initial collapse of the overdense region and the subsequent matter accretion. thus, we obtain p/m/ m/ ita . assuming that p tx, ms/r s and m ms at r rs, it is written as r s m/ s tx m/ ita . the radius rita and the mass mita of the overdense region can be connected to the characteristic radius rs and mass ms of the nfw prole. this is because the evolution of both overdense region in the similarity solution and the inner region of the nfw prole (r < rs) is related to the background universe, and they evolve in a similar way. in fact, the evolution of the former is described by the conventional spherical collapse of an overdense region , and thus the typical density is proportional to that of the background universe at the collapse. the same applies to the latter because the characteristic density s is always times as large as that of the background universe at the formation redshift z f . thus, we can assume that rs rita and ms mita, and that the collapse time of the overdense region corresponds to the formation redshift z f . in summary, the similarity solution has scales such as rita and mita. since rita and mita are proportional to rs and ms, respectively, the solution has scales of rs and ms. these scales represent the border between the initially-collapsed overdense region and the later-accreted region, although the actual transition is gradual. this also means that the initial collapse and the later accretion correspond to the fast-rate growth phase and the slow-rate growth phase, respectively. finally, from equation , we obtain r s m/ s tx = const , note that, although the radius rita is the turnaround radius of the overdense region, it is proportional to the radius of the region after the collapse because the solution is similar. galaxies , , of or tx m/ s /r s. equation forms a plane in the space. the direction of the normal when n = is shown in figure as ssol, and it is consistent with the clash observations and the results of numerical simulations. note that this relation ) is independent of redshift z at least z < , because rs and ms are physical values that have already reected the high density of the background universe in the past. the similarity solution indicates that clusters are not in virial equilibrium, because clusters are growing through matter accretion from their outer environments . that is one reason clusters follow equation instead of tx ms/rs, which could be realized if clusters are in virial equilibrium at their formation. the condition of the virial equilibrium is represented by k + w = , where k is the kinetic and/or thermal energy and w is the gravitational energy. however, according to the virial theorem, which is a higher-level concept of the virial equilibrium, additional terms are required when clusters are growing . one is the term representing the increase of mass and size of clusters and another is the boundary term originating from the ux of inertia through the boundary and the pressure at the boundary. the boundary corresponds to the splashback radius for dark matter and the shock front for gas . note that the similarity solution shows that clusters are almost in hydrostatic equilibrium in the sense that gas motion is negligible within clusters even if they are not in virial equilibrium . the relation between matter accretion and the cluster structure has also been numerically studied . figure shows the projection of the fundamental plane shown in figure on the log rslog ms plane. the solid arrow is parallel to the line of rs m/ s along which the distribution of the music clusters is elongated. this direction is also close to that of cluster evolution in figure projected on the log rslog ms plane . since we assumed that rs rita and ms mita, the line corresponds to the rst relation of equation when n = considering the derivation of the relations in equation , this indicates that the evolution of clusters on the fundamental plane reects the spectrum of the initial density perturbations of the universe and follows ms mita / . figure a also shows that the characteristic density s decreases as a cluster moves in the direction of the solid arrow. while the formation redshift z f is formally related to the collapse time of the overdense region, in reality, it is often related to the time of major cluster mergers. that is, the formation redshift z f is reset when the cluster experiences a major merger, and z f estimated from s for a given cluster at zobs often corresponds to the time when the cluster underwent its last major merger. in fact, numerical simulations have shown that an individual cluster intermittently moves in the direction of the solid arrow in figure every time it undergoes mergers . while the cluster temporarily deviates the general motion in the middle of a major merger, the deviation is conned in the fundamental plane and thus mergers do not much affect the thinness of the plane . in other words, the effect of major cluster mergers introduces some random history that could be different for clusters of the same mass, but since the mergers move cluster properties within the limits of the plane, the scatter of the plane does not increase very much. we would like to point out that in figure simulated clusters are not tightly distributed along the line of rs m/ s , and there is a scatter about the line. this reects the fact that the density perturbations of the universe are described by a gaussian random eld . thus, while the variance of the perturbation eld is a decreasing function of mass scale m, the amplitudes of the perturbations that collapse into objects with a given mass m are not always . owing to this, for example, s and ms are not perfectly in one-to-one correspondence, and s has some range for a given ms, which produces the band-like distribution of clusters in figure and on the fundamental plane . in other words, clusters form a two-parameter family. thus, a correlation between two physical quantities is generally represented by a band rather than a line unless some special combination of quantities is chosen. in that sense, it is natural that the relation between cand mhas a large dispersion , which will be discussed in section on the fundamental plane, different clusters move along nearly parallel but different tracks each of which galaxies , , of approximately follows the relation of rs m/ s . while the temperature of each cluster tx is affected by its formation time, it also depends on the track the cluster chooses. log log s

utilizing an analytic solution developed by Bertschinger to understand the spherical collapse of an overdense region in the universe. This solution provides insight into the matter profiles and their evolution, with non-dimensional parameters representing density, pressure, and mass. The solution also highlights the connection between the turnaround radius of the overdense region and the characteristic radius and mass of the NFW profile. Clusters are shown to be in a growth phase, leading to a deviation from virial equilibrium, and the relationship between matter accretion and cluster structure is explored. Observations and numerical simulations support the presented concepts, emphasizing that clusters are not in virial equilibrium and that major mergers impact the evolution of clusters. The text also discusses the dispersion in the relationship between density and mass, indicating that clusters form a two-parameter family rather than following a single correlation."
"the fundamental plane can be used to relate the cluster structure to the temperature. as an application, we discuss the masstemperature relation in this section. it is well-known that the mass of clusters and the x-ray temperature has a relation of mt/ . this relation is obtained by both observations and numerical simulations . conventionally, this relation has been explained based on the following three assumptions: the typical density of a cluster is = c ; clusters are well-relaxed or virialized, and they are almost isothermal within r; and the x-ray temperature is determined on a scale of r. here, we consider cluster temperature outside cool cores. the density is represented by e, where e is the hubble parameter at redshift z normalized by the current value h equation is associated with assumption . from assumptions and , we obtain tx m/rr er . eliminating rby using the relation rm/tx, the masstemperature relation is obtained: mt/ x /e , which well reproduces the results of observations and simulations . however, the assumptions are clearly inconsistent with the inside-out scenario of cluster formation and the fundamental plane. for example, the inside-out scenario indicates that clusters are not well relaxed and keep the memory of their formation in their structure. the angle of the fundamental plane shows that clusters are not virialized, as discussed in section the nfw prole ) is not an isothermal prole . these are inconsistent with assumption . moreover, the tight correlation of the fundamental plane shows that tx is determined by rs and ms, which contradicts assumption . galaxies , , of in , fujita et al. showed that the relation in equation can be derived using the fundamental plane and the halo concentrationmass relation. the fundamental plane relation in equation is rewritten as tx = tx  rs rs   ms ms / , where corresponds to a representative point on the fundamental plane, and we adopt rs = kpc, ms = m, and tx = kev based on the results of the music simulations . based on the inside-out scenario, there are analytical forms of the concentration parameter represented as a function of mand z. one example is c =  m hm  for = that was obtained by duffy et al. . from equation , we obtain r=  m c / . equations , and indicate that rs is a function of mfor a given z. moreover, equation suggests that ms is also a function of m: ms = m ln / ln c/ . thus, using equation , tx can be represented as a function of mfor a given z. figure a shows the results for n = using a general formula of c developed by correa et al. instead of equation . the slope is = for z = and = for z = (mt x). the slope is close to but slightly smaller than = . however, the derivation of the fundamental plane in section might be too simplied, and there might be some minor uncertainties on n . in fact, if we take n = , the slope becomes = for z = and = for z = note that, even if we assume n = , the direction of the fundamental plane ) is consistent with observations and simulations thus, the relation of mt/ x can be reproduced without the virial assumption or tx m/r. note that figure indicates that the red lines are slightly below the black lines . this may cause some bias about the slope index if clusters with various redshifts are plotted at the same time. for example, if higher-redshift clusters tend to have smaller masses and lower temperatures than lower-redshift clusters , the slope is slightly steepened . we note that voit already addressed this issue. he considered accretion history of clusters and the effects of cluster surfaces as we do. while we focused on the inner structure of clusters, he studied the evolution of global properties of clusters. he concluded that the approximate agreement between the mtx relation derived via the traditional collapse model ) and those of simulations and observations is largely coincidental. although our approach is different, our results support the conclusion. here, we see n as a parameter of the direction of the fundamental plane, and we do not intend to claim that the spectral index of the initial density perturbations is exactly . galaxies , , of figure mtx relation for = derived from the fundamental plane and the cmrelation : n = ;

"the thinness and solidity of the fundamental plane inspires applications in cosmology. here, we show that the plane can be used to calibrate cluster mass . precise estimation of cluster mass is important. for example, when cosmological parameters are derived from cluster number counts, scaling relations among observables are used and they are affected by the calibration of cluster mass . figure a shows the cross sections of the fundamental plane. the red open circles are the clusters of the clash sample , for which rs and ms are derived through gravitational lensing. the black dots are those of an x-ray sample , for which rs and ms are derived through x-ray observations assuming that the icm is in hydrostatic equilibrium. we discuss the fundamental plane formed by the clash sample and the one formed by the x-ray sample separately. fixing the direction of the plane normals at the one shown by ssol in figure , the distance between the two fundamental planes is estimated to be dfp = + dex in the space of . thus, the position of the fundamental planes are consistent with each other. however, the xfp seems to be located slightly above the cfp in figure a. the shift dfp may be caused by a possible systematic difference of observed rs or ms between cfp and xfp because they are obtained through different methods . the plane shift in the direction of rs or ms can be estimated from dfp. then, assuming the nfw prole or ), the shift in the direction of mcan be derived . p p fm figure cross sections of the fundamental plane. red open circles are the clash clusters and black dots are the x-ray clusters . relation between fmand concentration parameter c. solid lines are the ducial relations and the dash-dotted lines show uncertainties. the difference of black and red lines come from the different assumptions of the plane shift (figures are reconstructed from figures and of ). figure b shows the systematic difference of m, which is dened by fmmx/mc, where mx is the mass of a cluster on the xfp, and mc is the mass of the same cluster on the cfp. while the ratio fmdepends on the concentration parameter c, the dependence is weak. figure b shows that fm+ , which means that the cluster mass estimated through x-ray observations assuming hydrostatic equilibrium is % smaller than that estimated through gravitational lensing. since the error is rather large, the current dataset may not be accurate enough for the calibration purpose. however, the error could be reduced by using larger and more accurate datasets in the future. assuming that gravitational lensing mass is solid, the value of fm is consistent with the results of numerical simulations showing that hydrostatic mass tends to be smaller than the true mass .","The fundamental plane can be used to calibrate cluster mass in cosmology, which is crucial for deriving cosmological parameters from cluster number counts. Different methods, such as gravitational lensing and X-ray observations, are used to estimate cluster mass, leading to potential systematic differences. The study compares the fundamental planes derived from these different samples, indicating a slight shift possibly due to observational methods. The systematic difference in cluster mass between the two methods is highlighted, with X-ray observations tending to underestimate mass compared to gravitational lensing. Larger and more accurate datasets may help reduce errors in cluster mass calibration for future studies."
"finally, we would like to make comments on the halo sparsity, which has been proposed recently as a valid alternative to the full description of the dark matter prole. it measures the ratio of halo mass at two different radii and, in the case that the halo follows a galaxies , , of nfw prole, it is directly related to the halo concentration. the advantage in using the halo sparsity is that it has an ensemble average value at a given redshift with a scatter much smaller than that associated to the distribution in mass concentration and does not require any modeling of the mass density prole, which might signicantly deviate from a nfw one in particular in systems still in the process of complete relaxation, but only the integrated mass measurements within two overdensities. the use of the halo sparsity has also been proposed as new cosmological probe for galaxy clusters because it carries cosmological information encoded in the halo mass prole and, at given redshift, the average sparsity can be predicted from prior knowledge of the halo mass function. both the fundamental plane and the halo sparsity reect the halo concentration of clusters. while the fundamental plane gives us the direct information of cluster formation time, it is generally difcult to measure rs and ms observationally, compared with the sparsity. in future study, we will discuss the relation between the fundamental plane and the halo sparsity.","The halo sparsity is a recent concept proposed as an alternative to fully describing the dark matter profile. It measures the ratio of halo mass at different radii and is directly related to halo concentration in specific profiles. Using halo sparsity offers advantages such as having an ensemble average value and smaller scatter compared to mass concentration distribution. It does not require modeling of mass density profile but only integrated mass measurements within two overdensities. The halo sparsity is suggested as a cosmological probe for galaxy clusters as it encodes cosmological information in the halo mass profile. It can predict average sparsity based on prior knowledge of the halo mass function and reflects the halo concentration of clusters. Compared to the fundamental plane, the halo sparsity is easier to measure observationally. Further research will explore the relationship between the fundamental plane and halo sparsity."
"it has been known that the concentration of dark halos reects their formation history. in particular, the halo structure represented by the characteristic radius rs, and mass ms is related to the formation time of the halo. in this study, we showed that rs, ms, and the x-ray temperature tx of observed clusters form a plane in the space of with a very small orthogonal scatter. the tight correlation shows that tx is also affected by the formation time of individual clusters. numerical simulations supported the results and showed that clusters evolve along the plane. the plane and its angle in the space of can be explained by a similarity solution, which indicates that clusters are still growing and have not reached a state of virial equilibrium. in other words, when cluster formation and the internal structure is considered, matter accretion after the initial collapse cannot be ignored. the motion of clusters on the plane was determined by the spectrum of the initial density perturbations of the universe. the spread of clusters on the fundamental plane is related to the scatter of the halo concentrationmass relation. we also discussed applications of the fundamental plane. for example, we showed that the masstemperature relation of clusters (mt/ x ) can be explained by the fundamental plane and the halo concentrationmass relation without assuming virial equilibrium. we also showed that the solidity and thinness of the fundamental plane can be used to calibrate cluster mass. since the fundamental plane associates the structure of dark halos with the gas temperature, other applications may be possible. for example, the gas temperature tx of a dark halo could be estimated from rs and ms obtained through n-body simulations without calculating gas dynamics. author contributions: y.f. coordinated the research, wrote the manuscript, obtained the fundamental plane, and made a theoretical interpretation. s.e. provided the x-ray data and contributed in the interpretation of the ndings. k.u. analyzed the data of gravitational lensing and contributed in the interpretation of the ndings. e.r. and m.m. analyzed the numerical simulations, kindly provided by the computational groups in trieste and madrid, and t the data with the nfw prole. m.d., e.m., n.o., and m.p. contributed in the interpretation of the optical and x-ray results and provided extensive feedback on the study. funding: this work was supported by mext kakenhi no. k . s.e. acknowledges nancial contribution from the contracts naro asi-inaf i///, asi --r. and asi-inaf n.--h. k.u. acknowledges support from the ministry of science and technology of taiwan (grant most -- m---my) and from academia sinica . e.r. acknowledge support from the exanest and euroexa projects, funded by the european unions horizon research and innovation programme under grant agreements no. and no. , respectively. acknowledgments: we thank referees for their useful comments, which were very helpful to clarify explanations. conicts of interest: the authors declare no conict of interest. galaxies , , of komatsu, e.;

"the study of stellar variability has been invigorated by the ad- vent of modern large scale sky surveys in the modern era. recent surveys such as the all-sky automated survey (asas; pojmanski ), the optical gravitational lensing experiment (ogle; udal- ski ),the northern sky variability survey (nsvs; woniak et al. ), macho , eros , the catalina real-time transient survey , e-mail: jayasinghearachchilage.@osu.edu the asteroid terrestrial-impact last alert system (atlas; tonry et al. ; heinze et al. ), and gaia (gaia collaboration et al. a; holl et al. ; gaia collaboration et al. b) have collectively discovered variables. variable stars are excellent astrophysical probes and have been used in numerous astronomical contexts. pulsating variables such as cepheids and rr lyrae stars are commonly used as distance in- dicators owing to the period luminosity relationships seen amongst these variables (e.g., leavitt ; matsunaga et al. ; beaton et al. , and references therein). eclipsing binary stars are ex- cellent probes of stellar systems and with sucient radial velocity the authors arxiv:v feb t. jayasinghe et al. followup, allow for the derivation of useful astrophysical parame- ters, including the masses and radii, of the stars in these systems . variable stars are also useful for the study of stellar populations and galactic structure (matsunaga ; feast, & whitelock ) . until recently, the all-sky automated survey for supernovae monitored the visible sky to a depth of mag with a cadence of - days using two units in chile and hawaii each with telescopes. starting in , asas-sn expanded to units with telescopes. the new units all started with g-band lters and the original units have now switched to g-band as well. the asas-sn telescopes are hosted by the las cumbres observatory (lco; brown et al. ) in hawaii, chile, texas and south africa. asas-sn primar- ily focuses on the detection of bright supernovae (e.g., holoien et al. , a), tidal disruption events (e.g.,holoien et al. , , b) and other transients (e.g., tucker et al. ; rodrguez et al. ), but its excellent baseline allows for the study of variability amongst the million bright sources across the whole sky. asas-sn team members have also studied the relative specic type ia supenovae rates and the largest amplitude m-dwarf ares seen in asas-sn . in paper i , we reported , new variables that were agged during the search for supernovae, most of which are located in regions close to the galactic plane or celestial poles which were not well-sampled by previous surveys. in paper ii , we uniformly analyzed , known variables from the vsx catalog, and developed a robust variability classier utilizing the asas-sn v-band light curves and data from external catalogues. we have also explored the synergy between asas-sn and apogee with the discov- ery of the rst likely non-interacting binary composed of a black hole with a eld red giant and a detailed variability analysis of the apogee sources to identify peri- odic variables . we have also identied rare variables, including very long period detached eclipsing binaries and r coronae borealis stars (shields et al. ) . the transiting exoplanet survey satellite (tess; ricker et al. ) will produce a large number of high-quality light curves with a baseline of at least days for most of the sky. the tess input catalog contains million sources, out of which , selected targets are observed at a min cadence, while the remaining sources are observed with a cadence of min. oelkers et al. recently identied variable sources in a sample of million tic sources, but did not classify these variables into explicit types. these sources were classied in paper ii using asas-sn data. sources closer to the tess continous viewing zone will be observed for a substantially longer period, approaching one year and , epochs at the ecliptic poles. these tess light curves will probe short period variability in great detail. asas-sn provides long baseline light curves sampled at a cadence of days, that complement the tess light curves. we extracted the asas-sn light curves of million sources within deg of the southern ecliptic pole. these sources are within the southern tess cvz and will have well-sampled tess light curves. in this work, we systematically search this sam- ple for variable sources. this is, in part, a test run for carrying out such a search over the entire sky. in section , we discuss the asas-sn observations and data reduction procedures. section discusses the variability search and classication procedures. in section , we discuss our results and present a summary of our work in section all the light curves of these sources are made available to the public through our online database.","The study of stellar variability has advanced with modern large-scale sky surveys, such as ASAS, OGLE, NSVS, MACHO, EROS, ATLAS, and Gaia, discovering variable stars with various astrophysical applications.

ASAS-SN, expanding to units with telescopes since , focuses on bright supernovae, tidal disruption events, and other transients, offering a large baseline for studying variability among millions of bright sources. Recent work includes identifying new variables close to the galactic plane, developing a variability classifier, and exploring rare variables like detached eclipsing binaries and R Coronae Borealis stars. The TESS mission is expected to produce high-quality light curves for millions of sources, with ASAS-SN providing complementary long baseline light curves that will be made publicly available."
"we started with the aavso photometric all-sky survey (apass; henden et al. ) dr catalog as our input source catalog. we selected all the apass sources with< mag in all the asas-sn elds with central eld coordinates within deg from the southern ecliptic pole . this resulted in a list of m sources spanning a total of , deg asas-sn v-band observations were made by the brutus"" and cassius"" quadruple telescopes between and each asas-sn eld has - epochs of observation to a depth of mag. each camera has a eld of view of deg, the pixel scale is and the fwhm is pixels. asas-sn nominally saturates at mag, but light curves of saturated sources are sometimes quite good due to corrections made for bleed trails . the light curves for these sources were extracted as described in jayasinghe et al. using image subtraction (alard & lup- ton ; alard ) and aperture photometry on the subtracted images with a pixel radius aperture. the apass catalog was used for calibration. the zero point osets between the dierent cameras were corrected as described in jayasinghe et al. . figure illustrates the relationship between the measured mean asas-sn v-band magnitudes and the apass dr v-band mag- nitudes. sources with mean mag have similar v-band magni- tudes, but a large fraction of the sources with mean mag show a discrepancy between the asas-sn and apass measurements. this is due to blending in elds with signicant stellar densities . the relatively large asas-sn pixel scale of as compared to the smaller apass pixel scale of makes asas-sn photometry more susceptible to blending. thus, asas-sn v-band measurements are systematically brighter for most sources in the lmc due to blended light. the light curve extraction provides a statistical error estimate, but the scatter in the light curves of apparently non-variable sources is generally larger than expected given the nominal statistical un- certainties. in jayasinghe et al. , we used the reduced statistic, dof = = mean  , where is the v-band magnitude for epoch , and mean is the mean v-band magnitude to determine the typical total uncertainty as a function of magnitude. in this work, we update our approach to estimating the systematic uncertainties in the asas-sn photometry. we can view the photometric errors as the quadrature sum of the estimated statistical uncertainty stat and a systematic sys , with = sys + stat . we can measure as the root-mean-square scatter in the light curves of non-variable stars, and then subtract the estimated statistical errors to derive sys, with the results shown in figure for the m sources in our sample. for sources with mean < mag, the photometric uncertainties approach an asas-sn error oor of mnras , asas-sn catalog of variable stars iii asas-sn v-band magnitude residual apass dr v-band magnitude figure comparison of the mean asas-sn v-band magnitudes to the apass dr v-band magnitudes. the red dashed line illustrates a perfect calibration. vmean log polynomial fit binned median: sys number of sources figure the distribution of sys for the m sources. the red points are the binned median values of sys for this sample in bins of mag. the blue curve shows a third order polynomial model for sources with > mag . mag. for the sources with mean > mag, we t a third order polynomial, log sys = + + , with = , = , and = to the median of the sys versus mean distribution. the polynomial smoothly joins to mag at = mag. to correct the errors in the light curves, we replace the formal magnitude errors by using equation and either equation or mag for sys. we also identied a systematic issue that aects the light curves of certain sources due to malfunctioning shutters. the shutters in j- hjd- v magnitude figure top: examples of images that are aected by a malfunctioning shutter for the non-variable source j-, with the reference image shown in the bottom right, bottom: the light curve for the source j- with the aected epochs highlighted by the red boxes. the asas-sn cameras periodically start to fail. degraded shutters do not close completely, and stray light from neighboring bright sources can impart trails on the images during readout . this systematic is illustrated in the light curve for the non-variable source j- . we see that after the mal- functioning shutter is replaced, the light curve returns to normal, but after days, the shutter begins to fail again. some fraction of our asas-sn light curves will be aected by this systematic.","The text describes the observations and data reduction process for the ASAS-SN project. It used the APASS catalog for input, with V-band observations made by the Brutus and Cassius telescopes. Light curves were extracted using image subtraction and aperture photometry. Calibration was done using the APASS catalog, with corrections made for differences between cameras. Systematic uncertainties in ASAS-SN photometry were estimated by separating statistical and systematic errors. A systematic issue was identified with malfunctioning shutters affecting certain sources' light curves, causing stray light trails in images. This issue impacted a fraction of ASAS-SN light curves."

This involved cross-matching apass sources to external catalogues, identifying candidate variable sources, classifying variables using a random forest classifier model, and implementing corrections to mitigate blending effects on the candidate variables."
"we identify cross-matches to the apass sources with gaia dr using the pre-computed cross matches from marrese et al. . the sources were also cross- matched to the probabilistic distance estimates from bailer-jones et al. . we also crossmatch the sources with mass (skrutskie et al. ) and allwise using a matching radius of we used topcat mnras , t. jayasinghe et al. to cross-match the apass sources with the mass and allwise catalogs . the large magellanic cloud lies within the tess southern cvz. we used gaia dr to identify , sources from our source list that are lmc members. for sources in the lmc, we use a distance of = kpc in our variability classier. variability cutos there are numerous methods to identify variable sources from a sample of light curves. the most commonly used method involves correlating the variations observed in multiple bands to pick out true variables from the false positives . the asas- sn observations used in this work are made with a single lter, which makes the use of multi-band variability statistics impossi- ble. in this work, we used several methods, including periodogram statistics, light curve features and external photometry to identify variable sources. we used the astropy implementation of the generalized lomb-scargle periodogram to search for periodicity over the range days for each of the m sources. we utilize the false alarm probability and the power of the best gls period as means of identifying signicantly periodic sources. sources with log < and gls power > were selected for further analysis . we calculated the laer-kinmann (laer & kinman ; clarke ) string length statistic on the temporal light curve using the denition = n = n = from clarke , where the are the magnitudes sorted tem- porally and is the mean magnitude. we can also calculate this statistic sorting the light curve based on phase for a given period, which we will call . to identify red variables, we empir- ically isolate sources with < and the gaia dr color > mag . red variables typically have long periods that result in noticeable structure in their temporal light curves. this structure results in smaller values of for the light curves of long period variables when compared to sources with short term variability . we also compute the ratio of magnitudes brighter or fainter than average (hl; kim & bailer-jones ; jayasinghe et al. b) for all the sources. we found in paper ii that eclipsing bi- naries have larger values of hl than most variables, so we ag sources with hl > for further analysis. this variability cut is expected to improve the identication of detached eclipsing bina- ries. we also identify sources with a light curve rms larger than the th percentile for the other stars in magnitude bins of mag in order to select sources with signicant ux variations. the variability cuts and the number of variable candidates iso- lated through each cut are summarized in table the combination of these cuts help identify dierent variable sources and increase our completeness when compared to relying on just one or two pa- rameters. through these variability cutos, we identied , unique candidates. this amounts to % of the sources on the initial list. variability classication we derived periods for the , variable candidates follow- ing the procedure described in jayasinghe et al. . the astrobase implementation of the gener- alized lomb-scargle (gls, zechmeister & krster ;

It also details the methods used to identify variable sources, including periodogram statistics and light curve features. The text explains the use of variability cuts to select variable candidates, with specific criteria such as period ranges and magnitude variability ratios. The variability classification process involves deriving periods for variable candidates and visually reviewing their classifications. Corrections are made to incorrect classifications, and sources with spurious variability are removed. The final list of variable sources is refined through these processes, resulting in an initial false positive rate of %."
"the large pixel scale of the asas-sn images ( ) and the fwhm ( ) results in blending towards crowded regions. the apass catalog was constructed with images that have a signicantly smaller pixel scale ( ), and as a result of this, multiple apass sources can fall into a single asas-sn pixel. we do not correct for the contaminating light in the photometry of the blended sources, but we identify and correct blended variable groups in our catalog. since we extracted light curves for the positions of apass sources, we can have two or more such sources inside a single asas-sn resolution element. if we select the sources with another apass neighbor within , we nd that of the , vari- ables had a neighbor within we compute the ux variability amplitudes for these sources using a random forest regression model . the majority of the variable groups con- sisted of two sources, with a few groups consisting of up to three sources. for each variable group, we consider the source with the largest ux variability as the true variable, and remove the other overlapping sources from the nal list. following this treatment, our list of variables consisted of , sources. mnras , asas-sn catalog of variable stars iii figure the distribution of the gls false alarm probability , and the distribution of gls power for the m sources and the set of known variables from jayasinghe et al. . variable candidates had to lie in the shaded regions with log < and gls power > . gbp grp tt number of variables figure the distribution of with for the m sources. the red shaded box encloses the sources that meet the criteria of < and > mag used to identify red variable sources.","The text discusses the issue of blending corrections in the context of ASAS-SN images with large pixel scales. Due to the smaller pixel scale of the APASS catalog, multiple APASS sources can fall into a single ASAS-SN pixel, leading to blending in crowded regions. While contaminating light in blended sources is not corrected for in photometry, blended variable groups are identified and corrected in the catalog. A random forest regression model is used to compute flux variability amplitudes for sources with APASS neighbors within a specified distance. Variable groups typically consist of two sources, with some having up to three sources. The source with the largest flux variability in each group is considered the true variable, with overlapping sources removed from the list. The final list contains a total of [number] sources. The analysis involves evaluating variables based on false alarm probability and power, as well as identifying red variable sources based on specific criteria for magnitude variability."
"the complete catalog of , variables is available at the asas- sn variable stars database along with the v-band light curves for each source. table lists the number of sources of each variability type in the catalog. in paper ii, we used the reddening-free wesenheit magnitudes = grp , and = ks for variability classication. the wesenheit vs. color-magnitude diagram for all the variables is shown in figure we have sorted the variables into groups to highlight the dierent classes of variable sources. owing to the magnitude limit of asas- sn, we are only able to detect suciently bright sources ( mag, mag) in the lmc. this is evident in the wesenheit color-magnitude diagram for the lmc sources. for the sources outside the lmc, we probe a wider range of magnitudes ( mag), including rr lyrae, rotational variables and scuti variables. we have also plotted the wesenheit vs. color-magnitude diagram for all the periodic variables in figure , with the points colored according to the period. this essentially highlights the large dynamic range in period probed by the asas- sn light curves. we note that the identication of mira variables in the lmc is hindered by blending. due to blended light, the observed asas-sn amplitudes of these sources fall below the amplitude threshold of > mag that is used to dene a mira variable in our pipeline. in reality, some fraction of the lmc semi-regular variables in this catalog are actually mira variables. from the sample of known semi-regular variables in the lmc, we estimate that the fraction of mira variables classied as semi-regular variables is %. mnras , t. jayasinghe et al. figure the distribution of hl , and the distribution of log rms with mean magnitude for the m sources. the sources with hl > are shaded in blue and the sources with log rms > th percentile in each magnitude bin are shaded in red. the distribution of hl for the set of known variables from jayasinghe et al. is plotted in red. table summary of the variability selection cuts variable cut used to identify sources gls power > periodic variables gls log < periodic variables and > and < red variables hl > eclipsing binaries log > th percentile large variations table variables by type vsx type description lmc not lmc new discoveries cwa w virginis type variables with > d cwb w virginis type variables with < d dcep fundamental mode classical cepheids dceps first overtone cepheids dsct scuti variables ea detached algol-type binaries eb lyrae-type binaries ew w ursae majoris type binaries ell ellipsoidal variables hads high amplitude scuti variables rot rotational variables rrab rr lyrae variables rrc first overtone rr lyrae variables rrd double mode rr lyrae variables rva rv tauri variables sr semi-regular variables l irregular variables gcas cassiopeiae variables yso young stellar objects rot: uncertain rotational variables dsct: uncertain scuti variables gcas: uncertain cassiopeiae variables var generic variables mnras , asas-sn catalog of variable stars iii gbp grp wrp not lmc cassiopeiae stars cepheids delta scuti eclipsing binaries rr lyrae rotational variables semi-regular/irregular variables gbp grp wrp lmc figure the wesenheit vs. color-magnitude diagram for the variables, outside the lmc , and in the lmc . using the same color scheme, the combined wesenheit plr diagram for the periodic variables is shown in figure the plr sequences for the cepheids and semi-regular variables in the lmc are well dened . most of the eclipsing binaries identied in the lmc are either detached or semi-detached systems, and do not follow the well dened plr for contact binaries that is observed in the plr diagram for the sources outside the lmc. we also show the sky distribution of the variables identied in this work in figure we see that the distribution of eclipsing binaries and rotational variables is random, but the distribution of cepheids is strongly clustered towards the lmc as is expected. we also note the clustering of semi-regular/irregular variables towards the lmc and the galactic disk. we matched our list of variables to the vsx (watson et al. ) catalog available in october , with a matching radius of to identify previously discovered variables. the variables discovered by the all-sky automated survey (asas;

"f. tr[ ] sector f. tr[ ] sector introduction quantum conformal eld theories in various space-time dimensions attracted recently a considerable attention, due to their phenomenological importance in physics, for subjects ranging from the description of critical phenomena to the fundamental interactions beyond the standard model, but also due to their beautiful mathematical structure allowing to get a deep insight into the basic features of quantum field theory and, via ads/cft duality, of quantum gravity. in spite of the considerable simplications in the properties of cfts w.r.t. the massive qfts, the non-perturbative structure of strongly interacting cfts in d > dimension is very complicated and in general not very well studied analytically. a considerable progress in this direction has been achieved due to the conformal bootstrap methods based on the basic properties of cfts following from the conformal symme- try, such as crossing symmetry in various channels for the four-point correlation functions. but this approach stays to a great extent experimental, based on heavy numerical com- putations rather than on explicit analytic formulation of the nal results. a great progress in the understanding of analytic structure of cfts in d > dimensions has been achieved for various superconformal qfts, often due to the ads/cft correspondence. in a special case the n = sym the analytic study of ope data was greatly advanced due to the planar integrability of the theory . in particular, the spectral problem exact, all-loop calculation of anomalous dimensions of local operators found its ultimate formulation in terms of the quantum spectral curve a system of algebraic relations on baxter-type q-functions, supplied by analyticity properties and riemann-hilbert mon- odromy conditions . the integrability appears to persist for a class of -parameter -deformations of the r- symmetry of n = sym if one tunes the so-called double-trace terms, generated by the rg of the model, to their critical, in general complex values . the - deformed n = sym appears to be a family of non-sypersymmetric and non-unitary four-dimensional cfts labeled by t hooft coupling g and three -deformation angles j, j = , , the ope data of n = sym has been studied in numerous papers, using the integrability properties, as well as ads/cft correspondence for the strong coupling regime g , or a direct feynman graph calculus at weak coupling g apart from the spectral problem, an impressive progress has been achieved in a more dicult problem of computation of structure constants and correlation functions , as well as of /n c corrections . however, the ecient all-loop solution of these problems is still hindered by outstanding technical complexity. we also have to admit that integrability of n = sym is still a somewhat mysterious phenomenon, not very well understood, especially on the cft side of this ads/ cft duality. in , one of the authors and o. g urdogan proposed a family of non-unitary, non- supersymmetric cfts , based on a special double scaling limit of -deformed n = sym combining weak coupling limit of small t hooft coupling, g , and strong imaginary twist, j i, with three nite eective couplings j = geij/ the gauge elds and the gaugino decouple in this limit and one is left with three complex scalars and three complex fermions with certain chiral structure of interactions (see the lagrangian of the theory ,). these cfts, on the one hand, helps to shed some light on the origins of integrability in n = sym , and on the other hand, the double scaling limit signicantly facilitates the computations of interesting physical properties, such as ope data and certain multi-loop feynman graphs, revealing rich and instructive dynamical properties of the theory. it was further studied in , in particular, by the asymptotic bethe ansatz methods. this full three-couplings double scaled version of n = sym was dubbed in the chiral cft, or, shortly, cft. we will employ this name in what follows. in the single coupling reduction, = = , = , the theory reduces to two interacting complex scalar matrix elds ). the planar feynman graphs for typical physical quantities in such a bi-scalar theory appear to have, at least in the balk, the shnet structure where the massless scalar propagators form a regular quadratic lattice . this theory will be called in what follows the bi-scalar, or shnet cft. the shnet graphs of simple shape, such as a torus, appear to represent an integrable statistical mechanical system . remarkably, there exists also an integrable generalization of the fishnet cft to any dimension d . many results recently obtained for the biscaler shnet cft, would be too dicult to achieve for the analogous quantities in the full -deformed n = sym . among the studied quantities are anomalous dimensions of the operators tr[l ] dominated by wheel- type shnet graphs. they were computed explicitly, in terms of mzv values, at two wrappings and, iteratively, to any loop order for l = another remarkable example of exact computations, unique in d > cfts, are the all- loop four-point correlation functions of the shortest protected operators . the biscalar shnet cft gives a unique opportunity of the study the single-trace multi-point correlators and of the related exact planar scalar amplitudes, revealing their explicit and well-dened yangian symmetry . one is even able to compute exactly, using the above mentioned exact four-point correlators, the simplest non-planar (/n c ) scattering amplitude . all this shows that this integrable theory resulting from the double-scaling limit of planar -deformed n = sym allows a unique insight into the non-perturbative structure of strongly interacting cfts and a closer look at them could reveal many general properties of cfts in d > dimensions. it is also worth mentioning the existence of dimensional analogue of these cfts, obtained by a similar limit from the three-dimensional -deformed abjm model dominated by shnet graphs with regular triangular structure, as well as the d version of shnet cft , where the shnet graphs have a regular hexagonal structure. the bulk integrability of all three cases of regular shnet planar graphs was predicted in . whether as a big progress already has been done in the study of the bi-scalar shnet cft has been done, little is known about the most general version of the double-scaled -deformed n = sym mentioned above. until very recently, apart from the original formulation and the study, in , of asymptotic bethe ansatz equations for anomalous dimensions in certain sectors of this very interesting theory, as well as the computations of related unwrapped and single-wrapped feynman graphs, no serious attempts had been undertaken, at least until very recently, to understand deeper the physical properties and the feynman graph structure of the full cft. it is worth noticing that, unlike the bi-scalar shnet cft, the reasons for the integrability of this model remain mysterious. a few days before the completion of the current paper, a very interesting study of the one loop perturbative properties of this cft was undertaken , and especially of its two reductions: the bi-scalar shnet cft, as well as -deformed n = supersymmetric case, when all three couplings are equal . the paper explores an interesting subject of study of non-unitary spin chains, having a rich and complicated structure of the spectrum, including the jordan cells as specic multiplets of states. the jordan multiplets leading to the logarithmic behavior in non-unitary cfts , are noticed and studied perturbatively in the shnet cft . the notion of one-loop integrability in cft appears to be quite dierent from the one-loop integrability of its mother theory the n = sym . the non-unitarity of the studied cft represents an obvious drawback from the point of view of the physical interpretations: the presence of complex ope data violating var- ious basic quantum-mechanical axiomes and usual analyticity constraints. on the other hand, the non-unitary theories are curious objects in themselves, having interesting ope properties, such as a logarithmic behaviour of certain correlators cft is an example of logarithmic cfts). in addition, they share many basic common features with unitary cfts and help to understand their general features. we attempt in this paper to answer some of the questions posed above about the cft. first of all, we will give the complete description of the bulk structure of feynman graphs . it appears to be much richer than in the shnet cft, though much simpler than in the full n = sym conserving a certain lattice regularity. a pictorious way to describe these graphs is to introduce the regular triangular lattice and the to do all possible baxter moves of all three types of lines, as shown on fig. these lines should represent sequences of bosonic and fermionic propagators and the mixed intersections (where both bosonic and fermionic propagators meet) should be disentangled, in a unique way, into pairs of yukawa vertices). these congurations should be summed up, so that the collection of such graphs could be called the dynamical shnet. the integrability of these graphs, or the sum of them, remains to be proved, though we demonstrate it in this paper in a simpler case of the two-coupling reduction of cft ), with two bosonic and one yukawa coupling. then we will compute exactly the -point correlation functions of certain short, pro- tected scalar operators, similar those obtained in shnet cft . for that we identify all the graphs contributing these quantities and sum them up using the bethe- salpeter approach helped by the conformal invariance. in comparison to the shnet cft, the two-coupling dependence of these correlators in the full double-scaled cft reveals a rich phase structure in the coupling space. we study in detail the related perturbative expansions of these correlators, as well as their strong coupling limits. feynman graphs and correlators of cft the strongly -deformed n= sym theory in this section, we will study the generic structure of planar feynman graphs and discuss their integrability properties, in the full three-coupling chiral cft proposed in . this cft was obtained as a double scaling limit of -twisted n = sym described above. it is dened by the lagrangian for three complex scalars and three complex fermions transforming in the adjoint representation of su: l = nctr  jj + i j ( ) j  + lint , where the sum is taken with respect to all doubly repeated indices, including j = , , , and the interaction part is lint = nc tr h + + +i p ( + ) + i p ( + ) + i p ( + ) i . we suppressed in the last equation the spinorial indices assuming the scalar product of both fermions in each term. we will refer to this theory as cft theory. the double scaling procedure and the derivation of this action from -deformed n = sym can be found in papers ,. in the next sections, we will study the four- point functions obtained by point splitting of elds in coinciding points, in the two-point correlation functions of local operators of three types: tr[ j] , tr , tr[j k] . since the lagrangian depends on three arbitrary couplings, for some particular values of these couplings, interesting reductions of this cft emerge. for example, in the limit , one fermion decouples and we obtain the following action lint = nc tr  + + i p ( + )  . we will refer to this theory as cft theory. another interesting case of occurs when all three couplings are equal = = = and corresponds to the doubly-scaled -deformed sym . it has the following interaction lagrangian lint = nc tr  + +  + inctr  + + + + +  . figure : the chiral vertices of the ds theory . the graphs of the rst line represent the quartic scalar interactions and the ones in the second line are the yukawa interactions. tick solid lines and dashed lines represent scalar and fermionic propagators respectively. colors stand for the various avour of the particles i and i: black for i = , red for i = and green for i = arrows symbolize the xed orientation of the vertices and, according to our notation, it points always to the elds with bars or daggers. the second chirality of yukawa interactions i.e. the one with i i and i i with i = , , , can be represented as the second line of vertices with ipped arrows. in this case, one supersymmetry is left unbroken, as in the original -deformed n = sym. most of the papers on this relatively young subject were devoted to the abovementioned single coupling reduction of this model: = = , = , i.e. the bi-scalar, shnet cft dened by the action : l = nc tr  + +  . our paper is devoted to generalization of some of these results of to the full chiral model cft and to its various limits presented above. this represents a step forward, w.r.t. the bi-scalar model , in understanding the non-perturbative structure of physical quantities of the full n = sym . we will also describe the general bulk structure of the underlying planar graphs. in- deed, one interesting feature of those models is the drastic simplication of their weak coupling expansions in terms of feynman diagrams in the planar limit. in general, any di- agram of cft can be built as a collection of the vertices in fig., connected by scalar and fermionic propagators the arrows indicate the xed orientation of the interac- tions, i.e. in a propagator it is directed from a eld to its hermitian conjugate. an essential feature of is the absence of the hermitian conjugate of every interaction vertex, or of the vertices obeying the reality condition. the chirality of this theory makes it non-unitary apart from the double-trace vertices whose role will be discussed below and plays a crucial role for the underlying conformality and integrability in the t hooft limit. in fact, in the absence of the hermitian conjugate vertices, all the graphs which could renormalize the couplings and the mass are non-planar. as a consequence, we will see in sec. that the planar weak coupling expansion of physical quantities w.r.t. interactions in cft is dominated, at least in the bulk and for high enough perturbative order, by a specic class of planar diagrams having a kind of a lattice structure, much more rigid than the structure of graphs in the original n = sym . this lattice structure is richer, and more dynamical than in the bi-scalar theory where the unique regular square shnet structure dominates at any order in perturbation theory. in the full cft, due to the presence of yukawa interactions and quartic scalar vertices, there are more planar graphs contributing at each perturbative order, but the chirality still dramatically reduces their number. we can dubb the structure of full cft graphs as dynamical shnet. double-trace interactions and conformal symmetry the -deformed n = sym theory and its doubly-scaled version are not conformal in a strict sense, not even in the planar limit . indeed, the renormalization group calculations show that the new, scalar double-trace interactions are generated ldt = x j= h ,jtrtr[ j j]+ ,jtr[j j+]tr[ jj+]+ ,jtrtr[ j j+] i , where in our notation j+ = j + with the constraint + = the double-trace couplings k,j generically ow with the scale. they are needed to renormalise the -point correlators of the local operators tr, tr[j j+] and tr respectively. for any of these planar correlators only one double-trace term contributes, that is the -function of each k,j depends only on couplings {, , } and k,j itself. due to permutation symmetry of avour indices j = , , in the lagrangian , the functions k,j show the same symmetry in the coupling dependance, namely k,j = k,j(k,j, j, j +, j ) , thus will drop in what follows the specication of subscript j in double-trace couplings. the double-trace terms appear in the theory already at one-loop renormalization and the -functions associated to the couplings k are not zero. in -deformed n = sym the one-loop -function associated to the double-trace interaction trtr[ j j] of is k = g sin + k sin k + k + o(g, k) , where k are linear combinations of the deformation parameters j of the theory dened in . let us turn to the theory with the double-trace terms . in contrast to the bi-scalar theories, where the invariance under exchange ( j j+ j+ j allows to identify and , the presence of yukawa interactions in cft specically breaks this symmetry, and operators tr[j j+] and tr show dierent behaviour. when only one k coupling is running, the corresponding -function has the following form k = a + b k + c k , where a, b, c are functions of the couplings = {, , }. this quadratic behavior of as a function of k was encounter for the rst time in as an example of non- supersymmetric orbifold theories with double-trace interactions and established in for a generic deformed theory in the t hooft limit. if the running coupling k is associated to the double trace interaction trotro of length-two scalar operators o, the functions a, b and c are related to the normalization coecient of the two-point function of o, the contribution of the single-traces to the anomalous dimension of o and the coecient of the induced double-trace terms. to make the theory conformal at the quantum level, one needs to tune the double- trace couplings to a xed point. in the original -deformed n = sym , the t hooft coupling g is not running, so the critical point for double-trace couplings can be computed imposing the vanishing of their -functions. in the case of a single running coupling, has the following xed points k= ig sin + k sin k + o . similarly, the coupling constants i of the theory are not running in the t hooft limit and one can ne-tune the double-trace couplings i to critical values in terms of their i dependence, imposing the vanishing of the underlying -function as follows k ! = k= b b ac c . at the two xed points , it is possible to write the anomalous dimension of the operator o in terms of the discriminant of k = o= b ac . at the xed points for all double-trace couplings of -deformed n = sym , the theory becomes a genuine non-supersymmetric cft. this conformal theory appears also to be integrable and its spectrum of anomalous dimensions can be treated by such a powerful tool as quantum spectral curve . the same statements hold for the double-scaling limit of the d cft theory , to which we have to add the double-trace lagrangian . integrability of the full cft is still a conjecture, as it is for the full -deformed n = sym . it was demonstrated explicitly only for the simplest reduction of cft the bi-scalar cft , where the shnet planar graphs have an iterative regular lattice structure , shown to be integrable long ago by a.zamolodchikov . we extended the proof of integrability to a larger, two-coupling sector of cft in sec., by methods of conformal su quantum spin chain. in the case of cft we also have good chances to prove full integrability on the level of planar feynman graphs since, as we show below, these graphs preserve a certain rigid lattice structure. the obvious physical defect of such cfts is the loss of unitarity. indeed, as it will be clear with the explicit example below, the discriminant of the equation i = is negative, inducing complex values for the xed points and anomalous dimension . moreover in the ads/cft context, this fact can be interpreted as the presence of true tachyons in the bulk on the string theory side . the one-loop anomalous dimension of the length-two operator tr in -deformed n = sym at the xed point is jj= ig sin + j sin j + o. notice that both the xed points and the anomalous dimensions are complex conjugate, as expected. those relations are actually valid in the full -deformed n = sym theory, but in the double-scaling limit under analysis it is simple to obtain some predictions for the one-loop , the associated critical points and the anomalous dimensions. in particular we have jj ds limit = i( j+ j) + . . . and ds limit = i j+ j + . . . . in sec. and sec. we will verify these results computing the exact spectrum of the operator tr with the bethe-salpeter method, and the rst order of the xed point using feynman diagrams. non-unitary cfts are usually logarithmic , i.e. with an interesting, logarithmic behavior of certain correlators. the -deformed n = sym and its double-scaled version the cft are not exceptions: they show the same logaritmic properties due to the non-hermiticity of their dilatation operators . the bulk structure of large planar graphs let us try to describe the general structure of an arbitrarily big feynman graph in the bulk, far from the boundaries. the generic picture is illustrated on fig. the theory contains complex scalars i and complex fermions i labelled by i = , , we chose to represent scalar propagators with thick solid lines and fermionic propagators with dashed lines , while the label denoting their u avour ) is mapped into colours: . in fig., coloured dotted lines in a particular direction represent a generic propagator, both scalar or fermionic. in this framework, a set of parallel lines represents any combination of fermionic and scalar propagators of a given avour. this system of three dotted lines forms a lattice which combines the features of both regularity and irregularity. any such lattice can be obtained from the regular triangular lattice (or a more general kagom e lattice) by arbitrary baxter moves of all lines: displace- ments in the direction orthogonal to the line, i.e. conserving its direction. the links of the resulting lattice are propagators while nodes are quartic eective in- teractions. these interactions are of three kinds, depending on which lines are crossing and figure : general dynamical shnet bulk structure of a planar graph for -coupling chiral cft . dotted lines represent scalar or fermionic propagators (the rules for the choice of propagators will be explained below and demonstrated in fig.) the colors and directions of the lines stand for the three avours of the particles i = , , with the same notation as we used in fig. the intersections correspond to six dierent eective vertices that can be written in terms of the usual ones following the map given in tab. which propagators enter the corresponding crossing . they can represent a set of or various yukawa vertices, according to the rules listed in tab. indeed in this framework, a quartic vertex involving fermions can be though of as a couple of yukawa vertices, or similarly, as a split quartic vertex in which we have added a propagator in the remaining direction, according to the rules in tab. the quartic interaction can involve four scalars, four fermions or two of each. moreover, we chose the directions of the arrows to be consistent with the feynman rules in fig. depending on the orientation of the mixed interactions we will refer to them as crossing or scattering interactions as in tab. given three sets of parallel lines crossing each other with quartic interactions, the resulting irregular lattice is formed by a nite set of convex polygons. the smallest possible n-gon is a triangle and the largest one is a hexagon. those convex polygons can be constructed locally by the abovementioned moves of lines in two or three dierent directions: directions : we can discard the lines in one of the directions. the local interaction of lines with only two directions forms a square lattice as in . since we are considering three colors, we can have three dierent squares depending on their directions. directions : in this case there are more possibilities to build convex polygons. indeed lets start with the crossing of three lines with three dierent directions. locally, they form a triangle that can have two dierent orientations. adding another line, parallel to one of the previous three, and cutting the triangle, we will end up with a square. since we can add a line of any color and there are two possible triangle orientations, we can draw dierent squares. iterating this cutting procedure by adding one and two lines we obtain pentagons and the hexagon. in the following table we recap all the possible n-gons and their multiplicity, that is the eective real eective real eective real -scalar -fermion crossing scattering table : substitution rules for the eective vertices appearing in the shnet bulk structure of fig. in terms of the feynman rules of fig. any eective vertices is associated with a combination of the coupling constants i with i = , , of order number of dierent ways the same polygon can appear in the graph. figure : one of the possible congurations in terms of eective vertices of tab. for the bulk topology represented in fig. the diagrams at the two sides of the gure represents the parts of the graph in the light-blue circles in terms of real vertices of fig. according with the rules given in tab. we stress that given a set of eective vertices, the translation in real vertices is unique. n-gon d multiplicity it follows that for a given set of lines, the resulting lattice can be seen as a tiling of the plane with dierent tiles. the structure of the shnet bulk is very rich, indeed once the topology of the lattice is dened as in fig., some information is lost, as any quartic dotted-vertex can be associated to six dierent physical vertices, as listed in tab. the number of possible feynman diagrams nd which can be associated to a given close n-gon, dened by n quartic dotted- vertices, can be computed considering rst all possible combinations of fermionic and scalar propagators for the edges of the polygon and then cancel out those vertices which does not t in any conguration. after this tedious combinatorics we obtain the following table n-gon d nd this result can be written in the following compact formula nd = + n . now we can estimate the number of feynman diagrams for a given topology of the dotted- shnet bulk. this number has the sum of all the nds for all the polygons as an upper bound and we can estimate its order of magnitude. then the number of possible feynman diagrams for the topology of the shnet bulk given in fig. is around moreover, since any vertex is associated with a combination of the couplings i with i = , , of order , we know that the diagram in fig. is of order one of those congurations is represented in fig. figure : the result of drawing a disc on the lattice of fig. can be inter- preted as one planar graph contributing to an n-point functions of the kind , drawn in terms of eective vertices. in this example we present tr[ ], and the graph is of or- der as it results from tab., each eective vertex can be replaced in a univocal way in terms of structure made of real vertices. single-trace correlation functions we can realize the above mentioned bulk graphs as a single-trace operator of the form: k = tr , {j, j, j , j }, (j = , , ; , = , ), i.e. each under the trace is one of elds of the cft model -. of course must have zero overall r-charge, to have a non-zero answer. this implies a condition on the elementary elds under trace, namely if we dene nj and mj as the dierences be- tween the number of j, respectively j and the conjugated elds, the mentioned condition reads nj + mj x k=j nk = , j = , , . to describe the feynman graph content of this quantity, let us remind that a similar single-trace correlator in bi-scalar shnet cft , consisting only of scalar elds, was given by a single shnet graph of the disc topology where the disc was cut out across the edges of a regular square lattice. the ends of the cut edges represented external xed coordinates and the integrals were taken over all vertices inside the disc. similarly, for each of the quantities there exist a collection of graphs of the disc shape cut out of the lattice of the type drawn on fig. the types of external legs the cut edges along the boundary dene the species of elds from the set following in the same order under the trace in . we present an example in fig., where the disc is drawn on the concrete realization of the lattice as given in fig. a big dierence w.r.t. the bi-scalar single-trace correlators is that in the full cft such a quantity is dened by the sum of all graphs with the same order of elds on the boundary (same sequence of external figure : other possible planar graphs for the same -point function of fig.

legs) which are related to each other by the orthogonal moves of three types of parallel lines described in the previous subsection ). furthermore, even at xed topology, one can change the interaction vertices inside the graph, namely switching some dashed lines to solid lines and vice-versa ). this corresponds to dierent realizations of a disc segment of the dotted-lattice in fig. with boundary conditions xed by the external legs. the number of possible graphs can be estimated by considerations of the previous subsection. this single-trace correlator can be used to dene the scattering amplitudes via lehmann-symanzik-zimmerman procedure, by going to the dual momentum space and taking on-shell external momenta, in the spirit of the papers . it is worth noticing that not all the planar single-trace correlators are obtained out of this procedure. indeed certain external states can be cut out only drawing a circle on the actual feynman graph where all propagators are explicitly drawn. moreover, for a given correlation function, there are lower order graphs in the coupling which cannot be cut out of the planar lattice, but from two or more sheets of such lattice as explained in . it would be interesting to show the yangian invariance of these single-trace correlators, in the same spirit as it was done in for bi-scalar case. namely, to dene the monodromy around the boundary for which each of these graphs, or sum of all graphs, is an eigenfunction. this is one of the ways to show the integrability of the full cft. in this paper we will limit ourselves by the proof of integrability of the model which will be given in the next subsection. integrability of wheel graphs in cft a statement of integrability, milder than the lattice integrability of the bulk of large pla- nar graphs, can be made for the scaling dimension of tr[l j ] operators at any l. these operators, protected in the original n = sym due to supersymmetry, are described in the planar limit of bi-scalar theory by a perturbative expansion in globe-like shnet graphs with an integrable square-lattice bulk . these graphs can be built up by the action y y y x x x figure : an example of bulk of planar diagram appearing in the perturbative expansion of tr[ j]tr[ j]. it mixes together a square lattice structure of quartic scalar interactions and the brick-wall domain made by yukawa interactions. this case cor- responds to the operatorial expression h b ( h f ) h b . of an integral graph-building kernel h b [ h b ] = l z l y k= dyk , yl+ y . it represents one of the conserved charges generated by the transfer matrix of the inte- grable quantum su spin chain of l sites in the scalar = represen- tation . similarly, in the two-coupling version of cft the perturbative expansion can be described by graphs which, in spite of more complicated structure , can be still built by integrals of motion of the conformal spin chain. namely, every planar graph in the j expansion is a certain permutation of multiple action of operators h b and h f , where the latter operator is responsible for fermionic loops contribution. as we will see, the order in the permutation doesnt matter, since any fermionic loop can be moved through scalar wrappings, due to their commutativity, and this fact lays at the basis of integrability of these graphs. the action of h f reads [ h f ] = z l y k= dyk dzk h f h f = tr[ l l] l z l y k= dzk kk |zk yk||zk+ yk| , and it builds up an integrable brick-wall domain . its commutation with h b can be proven directly by star-triangle relation , as shown in fig. in order to show that h f is a conserved charge of the conformal scalar spin chain, we should prove its commutation with the transfer matrix at any value of the spectral x

limit u , as pointed out in , since the rst propagator under the integral in disappears and the last one eectively becomes a -function. now we introduce the transfer matrix for the brick-wall domain t f = tr[ r r rl], rj end l c) [( rij) ]= u z dxidxj ( ) x ij x ij (x i, x j) (x ij)u(x ji)+u(x ij)+u(x ij)u+ , and we check, similarly to the above scalar case, that limu t f = h f . the nal step to prove is to show that [t, t f ] = u, v , here we implicitly mean the trace over spinorial indices of the fermionic loop.

means of a yang-baxter type relation r ij r ik rjk = rjk r ik r ij . graphically represented in fig. indeed follows immediately from . first of all we can introduce the monodromy operators = h r rl i and = r rl , then iterating we can write h r i = h r i , and we nally trace over space l l and over spinorial indices getting tr,   = tr,  r r  tr   tr   = tr   tr   , which is equivalent to . our derivation straightforwardly shows that from the point of view of integrability the regular square lattice and the brick-wall lattice built by yukawa vertices can be combined into the same integrable structure and form a mixed lattice. this concludes the demonstration of integrability of the two-coupling model . the proof of integrability of the full cft is a more tricky exercise and we leave it for the future. bethe-salpeter equation for four-point correlators and conformal data in this and the next sections of this paper, we will exploit conformal symmetry and the bethe-salpeter method to obtain the exact -point correlations functions goo = trtr[o o ], where the operators oi are protected operators in the double-scaled -deformed n = sym theory, the cft. then we will extract from it the ope data, anomalous dimensions and structure constants, for length- unprotected operators exchanged in the s-channel of . in the current section, we present the generalities of conformal bethe-salpeter approach, generalizing the one applied in to the bi-scalar shnet cft, to sum up the feynman graphs for these quantities in cft. at the xed point and in the planar limit, the correlation function is a nite function of the couplings i with i = , , the correlation functions can be remarkably written as a geometric sum of primitive divergencies in the perturbative expansion. for this reason, we will study those diagrams with the help of the bethe-salpeter equation. in the following we will review the bethe-salpeter method pointing out how to extract the spectrum and the ope data from the four-point functions . in sec., we presented the bulk shnet structure of large planar diagrams in the general double-scaled deformed n = sym theory. in this section we will focus on the correlation functions dened by for matrix operators with bare dimensions o and o since to preserve the renormalizability of the theory we have to supplement it with double-trace counter-terms , diagrams in the perturbative expansion of will take the following chain structure b b f f where the black dots are insertions of the double-trace operator and the links of the chain are periodically repeating congurations of propagators (a special case of the topologies presented in sec.) generated by the kernel of integral operators. we will refer to this set of operators as hamiltonian graph-building operators hi. in the family of theories we are considering, hi hamiltonians can be of three dierent kind: the double trace operator v, the bosonic operator hb and the fermionic operator hf . the operators v, hb and hf separately produce divergent integrals. however, at the xed point, their combination is nite due to conformal symmetry . these integral operators commute among themselves and they are diagonalized by the same basis of conformal triangles the - point correlators of the protected operators with un protected operator with spin, described below. such insertions should always split a graphs, and its color structure, into two disconnected pieces. the correlation function can be written in general as a geometric series of a linear combination of the hamiltonian graph-building operators as follows goo =  cb x o+od x = hb(v v + b hb + f hf ) =  cb x o+od hb v v b hb f hf , where cb = / is the normalization factor of the free scalar propagator, v, b an f are combinations of the couplings i and i with i = , , , which will be introduced later . the spacetime dimension d in this paper is always taken to be d = the correlation function can be obtained from the operator goo as follows goo = x, x| goo|x, x, where the hamiltonian operators are represented by the corresponding integration kernels such that x, x| hn i |x, x= z n y k= dykhihihi . in order to compute the correlators goo, given the set of hamiltonian graph-building operators hi, we need to compute their eigenvalues and decompose goo over a complete basis of their eigenfunctions. to compute the eigenvalues of hi, we can use the fact that these integral operators transform covariantly with respect to the conformal spin chain gen- erators. this property completely xes their eigenstates to be the conformal triangle ,s,x, the three-point function of two operators in x and x with an operator o,s with scaling dimension , spin s at the position x ,s,x = tro,s =(x )p o+o (x ) oo p(x ) oo p  x x s , where p = s and n an auxiliary light-cone vector. in the case s = , the conformal triangle is composed by simply three scalar propagators that we can graphically represents as follows ,,x x x x . it is possible to generalize the bi-scalar shnet theory to any integer dimension d, as in , at the cost of losing locality. it is not evident that such a generalization is possible for the full cft. in particular, dening the inversion i[x i ] = x i /x i , we have, for a conformal triangle xin the representation , i = x(x/x , x/x ) = ux(x/x , x/x ), and u = x x xs . we can check that for every integral operator: i[ hi] = u hiu finally, given the eigenstate , we can compute the spectrum of the hamiltonian oper- ators hi as follows h hi ,s,x i z dydy hi ,s,x = hi,s ,s,x, where hi,s is the eigenvalue. more specically, given the hamiltonians operators dened in , we have h v ,s,x i = hv,s ,s,x, h hb ,s,x i = hb,s ,s,x, h hf ,s,x i = hf ,s ,s,x in sec. and sec., we will verify that diagonalizes these hamiltonians and perform a direct computation of the eigenvalues. the scaling dimension appearing in is dened as = + i , with a non-negative real number. for such values of , the state ,s,x belongs to the principal series of type-i irreducible representations of the conformal group labelled by and the discrete compact spin s and satises the orthogonality condition z

,s,x forms an orthonormal basis for implying the following representation for the identity = x s= s (x )oo z d c z dx,s,x,s,x , that, together with the denition , leads to the diagonalized representation hi = x s= s (x )oo z d hi,s c z dx,s,x,s,x , where hi stands for the set of hamiltonians {v, hb, hf } and hi,s for the set of eigenvalues {hv,s, hb,s, hf ,s} respectively. plugging the representation for the graph-building operators hi into , we obtain the representation of the -point function in terms of their eigenvalues hi,s goo = x s= s (x )oo z d c hb,s vhv,s bhb,s f hf ,s z dx,s,x,s,x the integral over the auxiliary point x can be expressed in terms of the four-dimensional conformal blocks g,s z dx,s,x,s,x =  x x  o+o x x  oo c cg,s + c cg,s  , where the cross-ratios are u = z z = x x /(x x ) and v = ( z) = x x /(x x ) and we recall from that g,s = s z z z z [kk(s , z) k(+ s, z)k] , where k = x/ f  , + , , x  . inserting into , we obtain goo =  c b x x o+o x x oo goo , where we dened goo = c b x s= s z d c hb,s g,s vhv,s bhb,s f hf ,s . notice that we extended the integral over on the full real axis with the change of variable in the second term of . this is allowed by the symmetry of eigenvalues appearing in the spectral equation hi ,s = hi ,s , and can be interpreted as the fact that, for a given spin s, states with dimension and belong to a unitary equivalent representation of the conformal group. this symmetry is indeed satised for every studied case, , and . before studying the integral in , we want to focus on the role of the double- trace hamiltonian and its eigenvalues in the perturbative and bethe-salpeter approaches. to nd the correlation function , we have to sum up diagrams of the kind shown at the beginning of this section. these diagrams contain an involved scalar and fermionic structure generated by the operators hb and hf interspersed with the contributions of the double-trace vertices introduced in . since in general the integrals over the positions of the single-trace vertices develop ultraviolet divergencies at short distances, one needs the double-trace interactions to produce other uv divergent contributions which cancels against them. therefore, the weak coupling expansion of the four-point correlation function remains uv nite at any order as expected for protected o and o in the context of the bethe-salpeter equation the story is slightly dierent. indeed consider the hamiltonian operator v associated to the double-trace kernel dened as follows h v i = c b z dydy , where is a test function. we have to compute its spectrum by means of that, when applied to , reads h v ,s,x i = s, ,s,x hv,s = s, . first of all, due to the form of the eigenvalue, the double-trace term can aect only the contribution to the sum in with spin s = then we expect that the contribution to given by the hamiltonian operators hb and hf are well-dened for s = but in principle we have to take into account the double-trace term for s = since we want to write goo in the standard ope form, we will consider the limit in which two of the external points are approaching, i.e. |x| (or u and v ). since the conformal block scales as ups decaying exponentially for re , one can close the contour in the integral over in lower-half plane and then com- pute it by residues. at short distances, the eigenstate scales as ,s,x (x ) oo and thus it vanishes in the lower-half plane (which is true in our case, since o = o = and > ). in this case, the bosonic and fermionic operators do not develop uv divergencies (one can verify it in the two special cases that we study in detail in sec. and sec.). moreover, given the denition and the formula , the double-trace operator v annihilates ,s,x with im < for any s and therefore, it does not contribute. with this argument, we are able to neglect the double-trace contributions when we compute the four-point function goo with the bethe-salpeter method. then we can rewrite as follows goo = c b x s= s i c d c hb,s bhb,s f hf ,s g,s , where cis the close path in the lower-half plane. in order to compute the integral over in with residues, we have to identify the poles of the integrand. the physical poles are given by the zeros of denominator under the integral, i.e. by solutions of the equation hb,s f hf ,s hb,s = b . we will refer to as spectral equation: indeed given the eigenvalues hi,s and the constants i, solving the equation we will obtain the scaling dimensions as functions of the couplings i with i = , , and the spin s. in the integrand of , two series of spurious poles are generated by the measure c and the conformal block g,s. in app.e we will prove that the contribution of those poles cancel under the condition hi +s+k,s hi +s,s+k = k = , , . . . , which happens to be satised. finally goo is given by the sum of only the residues at the physical pole . then we can rewrite the correlation function in the standard form of a conformal partial wave expansion as follows goo = x ,s c,s g,s , with the ope coecients c,s dened as c,s = s c b res  c hb,s bhb,s f hf ,s  . the sum over in runs over the solutions of the spectral equation for scaling dimensions of exchanges operators with re > in the following sections, we will focus on the computation of the point-split four-point correlation functions of the operators introduced in , establishing the hamiltonian operators hi and the constants i appearing in from their feynman diagram ex- pansion. we closely follow in our analysis the logic of , but in contrast to this paper which treats the bi-scalar shnet cft, we have to introduce new types of diagrams into the bethe-salpeter procedure, reecting a richer structure of the full three-coupling cft. to write the correlation function in the standard ope representation requires, as the only dynamical input, the knowledge of eigenvalues hi,s of the hamiltonian operators. we will diagonalize hi to extract the conformal data, i.e. the scaling dimensions of the ex- changed operators and the ope coecients. in what follows we consider only single scalar elds as protected external operators and then we should set o = o = since the four-point correlator constructed from the second operator of is trivial , in the following two sections we will analyze the remaining two. exact four-point correlations function for o = o = in this section we consider the four-point correlators associated to the rst operator of , namely when o = o = j with j = , , since the computation of the correlators is the same for any j, we will consider the case j = and then the four-point function we want to study takes the following form g = trtr[ ]. this condition in the ope is equivalent to the restriction

and fermionic propagators respectively. the colors represent dierent avors j of the particles j and j: in particular black for j = , red for j = and green for j = the propagators are not crossing and are curved to stress the fact that they have a cylindrical topology. this correlation function was extensively studied in in the simplest case of the family of theories we are inspecting, i.e. the bi-scalar theory . in the planar limit nc , once chosen j = , the weak coupling expansion of in terms of feynman diagrams is given by a combination of the following bosonic vertices tr[ ] , tr[ ] , tr tr , and the following yukawa vertices i p tr[ ] , i p tr . in the following we will study the correlation function with the bethe-salpeter method. the bethe-salpeter method for the correlator g the perturbative expansion of can be written in the following form g = x = g , where g at any perturbative order contains contributions from the bosonic and fermionic integrals with dierent coupling dependencies. in fig., we present an exam- ple of an arbitrary feynman diagram contributing to g the black dots represents insertions of the double-trace vertex in the last line of that in the bethe-salpeter picture are associated with the operator v dened in . then it is straightforward to x the normalization of its coupling constant in as follows v = . in sec., we discussed the role of the double-trace terms in the computation of the four- point function, discovering that they are not contributing to the spectral equation. then, similarly to observations of , as far as we consider

point-splitting x = x and x = x, we need only to sum over the single trace contributions, namely the diagrams inside the chain link of fig. in sec. we will present in detail how the relation between single- and double-trace terms is crucial for the setting of the xed point . the rst two orders of the perturbative expansion are given by the diagrams repre- sented in fig. and they can be written as follows g = c b x x , g = c b( + ) z dydy (y ) c bc f z q i=dyidyi tr [] y y y y y y y y , where each scalar propagator brings in the factor cb/x ij and each fermionic propagator the factor cf / xij/x ij, where / x can be x or x. since the fermionic propagator can also be written as cb / xi/x ij we conclude that cf = cb = /. these functions can be expressed in terms of a combination of the hamiltonian graph-building operators hi. indeed dening the following kernels hb = c b x x x , hf = c b c f z dxdx tr [] x x x x x x x x x x , represented in fig., we can rewrite as follows g = x c b hb , g = x c b z dydy  ( + ) hb hb + hf hb  . the kernels transform covariantly under conformal transformations, then the cor- responding hamiltonian integral operators commute with the generators of the conformal group. when carrying on the perturbative expansion, it becomes clear that an arbitrary dia- gram at order is given by g = x c b hb h ( + ) hb + hf i . then the correlator can be presented in the following operatorial form g = x = g = x c b hb ( + ) hb hf . comparing it with the denition we x the values of the constants i (in this case v is not contributing) b = ( + ) , f = . eigenvalues of the hamiltonian graph-building operators writing the four-point correlation function in the standard ope form, as presented in detail in sec., involves the computation of the spectrum of the graph-building operators . the eigenstate that diagonalize the hamiltonians is dened in for o = o = and the eigenvalues are dened by means of equations and . substituting in the latter the kernels and using the denition , we will end up with a set of integrals that can be computed with the help of the star-triangle relations presented in app.c (also known as uniqueness method). the fact that all the integrals that we have to compute can be computed by means of the star-triangle relations is a consequence of the underlying conformal symmetry. bosonic eigenvalue: the bosonic eigenvalue

that the integrand is antisymmetric in the exchange y y for odd s, then the eigenvalue hf ,s is non-zero only for even s. in the s = case, the integral is known as a massless two-loop self-energy

graph-building operator associated to the -magnon correlation function. the -magnon hamiltonian is h-magnon = x /x hf but, when applied to the eigenstate ,s,x, that has in this case o = o = , it leads to an eigenvalue with the same integral representation as . the strategy to compute the eigenvalue is to write the following recursion relation for the integrals hf ,s = s + s hf ,s + s . solving the

suggests that the equation has solutions with bare dimensions + s and + s, in analogy with the same quantity in the bi-scalar theory . there are six such solutions, but only half satises the physical requirement re : one of them corresponds to the scaling dimensions of exchanged operator with bare dimension = + s and two to the scaling dimensions of operators with bare dimensions = + s. the remaining three solutions are related to the rst ones b the transformation and describe shadow operators, with re < in addition to that, there is an innite series of physical solutions around the bare

exchange of an innite tower of local primary operators in the ope of . writing as a function of the two couplings and expanding around the physical pole = is/ at weak coupling , , we obtain the

rst few terms since the following ones are cumbersome. we notice that the weak coupling expansions of , are divergent but, as it will be pointed out later in the analysis of sec., the sum of the two corresponding ope contributions has a well dened expansion similar considerations can be made for the solutions at higher twist t = s = , , . . . = t + s i t p t + . . . . the twist- solution corresponds to the operator tr + permutations , namely the traceless symmetric s-tensor obtained by insertion of light cone derivatives = n, n = into the operator tr[ ]. at twist- the matter content of the theory allows to nd several s-tensor operators satisfying the condition s = and having the right u quantum numbers ). twist- operators start mixing with each other. we perform an introductory analysis of this phenomenon for the simple scalar case s = in appendix f. at this stage the log-cft eects due to chiral interaction vertices in show up. the analysis suggests the presence at twist- of only two non-protected physical operators, which should be identied with the two solutions and at s = , in contrast to the bi-scalar shnet cft where only one type of twist- operators appears .similar considerations apply to the higher twist operators . indeed also for value of twist t > it is possible to nd several s-tensor primary operators with the correct set of cartans charges. the detailed study of these operators and their mixing would be an interesting insight in the structure of operator algebra of cft. we will restrict from here on most of our analysis to solution of twist two and four, whose contribution to the ope expansion appears to be enough for complete description of the rst non-trivial order of the weak coupling expansion, conrmed by direct computations in terms of feynman diagrams. we are grateful to g. korchemsky for the enlighting discussion about this point. recalling the denition , the weak coupling expansion for the twist-two operator goes in powers of of the original couplings which is exactly the expected behavior considering that the perturbative expansion in fig. alternates bosonic and fermionic wheels attached to the diagrams with two quartic or four yukawa single-trace vertices. on the contrary, the weak coupling expansions for the twist-four operators goes in power of of the original coupling. this fact can be understood looking at the expansion of around the physical pole located at = i/ indeed this expansion starts from //) and as a consequence the four-point correlation function is convergent when i/ if is nite while it produces a divergence when we consider the weak coupling limit , such that g the zero-spin case presents some peculiar behaviours. indeed, expanding for s = around the physical poles = , i at weak coupling, we obtain the following expansions for the solutions of s= = i + i + i [ + ] + . . . s= = + + + + + . . . s= = + + + . . . s= = t i t p t + . . . t = , , . . . . where the one-loop order of the scaling dimension s= is in agreement with the predic- tion . this twist- solution is the scaling dimension of the operator tr[ ], while the two solutions of twist- arise from the operatorial mixing in a similar way as to s = case analysed in appendix f. notice that the weak-coupling expansion of the twist-two operator is drastically dier- ent as compared to the s = case, indeed it goes in powers of the same behavior was noticed in and the reason is similar to the one explained above . we observe that, ex- panding around the physical pole = , the spectral equation goes as / then, when , the correlation function is convergent if is nite, but it produces a square-root divergence when we expand at weak coupling, as in the previous case. the fact that the weak-coupling and s limits are not commutative is related to this divergence. the divergence in the expansion of the scaling dimension of the twist-two operator is not a surprise. in fact, as noticed also in some dierent contexts in , in order to write the correlation function in the ope form as in , we assumed that in the integral no physical poles are located on the real -axes. however the poles that at weak coupling and when s = are situated at = is/ pinch the integration contour at the origin when s = , thus producing a divergence. hence, the contribution of the double-traces is needed in this case to produce a non-vanishing term that cancels this divergence at weak coupling. again, we stress that at nite couplings the solutions of are well-dened even at zero spin. strong coupling expansion: at strong coupling, , , we consider the four solutions of eq. of lowest twist. the solutions are related to the physical poles of the spectral equation located at = ei k + + . . . with k = , , , but only two of them satisfy the condition im < , the remaining solutions being associated to the shadow operators. however we stress that we are neglecting all the innite non-algebraic solutions of higher twist, purely generated by hf ,s. then we have = ei k p + + + + ei k h + i + . . . notice that, if all couplings scale as j , the strong coupling expansion is growing linearly with . this becomes clear if one expands the eigenvalues appearing in . indeed both of them decay at large as hb,s , hf ,s / then, since in the spectral equation the couplings appear in power of , it is evident that the expansion will contain terms linear in . the s limit is not singular at strong coupling and one can compute s= directly from . the spectrum of exchanged operators in reductions of cft in sec., we presented the -deformed n = sym theory in the double-scaling limit as a family of theories. in fact, playing with the three couplings j with j = , , it is possible to describe dierent lagrangians with dierent matter contents and symmetries. thus we want to obtain the spectrum of exchanged operators for each theory of this family simply taking the limit on the couplings in the spectral equation of the most general doubly- scaled theory. first of all, we recall the well-known result for the spectrum for the simplied lagrangian also known as d bi-scalar shnet cft. in this theory the only non-trivial four-point correlation function is g, and it can be written in the same ope form as the one we are considering as . by the bethe-salpeter method it is possible to compute the correlator at all-loops, since its perturbative expansion is generated only by a bosonic graph-building operator hb of , then we can extract the non-perturbative scaling dimension of the exchanged operators in the ope s-channel. the corresponding spectral equation is the same of with = and = (indeed the bi-scalar theory has only one coupling ) and it has two solutions corresponding to the twist-two and -four operators with the following scaling dimensions bi = + q + p + , bi = + q + + p + , together with two shadow solutions with = for re < the analytic properties of those solution and their weak- and strong- coupling expansions have been studied in detail in . the scaling dimensions of the exchanged operators in the correlation function g for theories dened as a reduction of cft as in sec., can be computed as solutions of the spectral equation in which we are applying some limits on the couplings, or limit cft bi ( ) bi ( ) t + s bi-scalar bi ( ) bi ( ) t + s +s +s t + s -deformed = = = +s table : in this table we summarize the operator and dimension content of exchange operators in three reductions of cft. even directly on the weak- and strong-coupling expansions. in the tab. we present the summary of our results. cft: since the spectrum of the exchanged operators for the four-point function g doesnt depend on , the limit in which one of the couplings of the full cft is going to zero is not unique. indeed if we set = , the scaling dimensions of the exchanged operators in the cft are the same of the full cft. on the contrary, if we set or to zero, the spectrum reduces to that of the bi-scalar theory depending on a single coupling. notice that in this case the number of solution of twist-four operators reduces to a single one, while the higher-twist operators get protected. bi-scalar theory: the reduction to bi-scalar theory corresponds to the limit in which two couplings of cft vanish. if one of the vanishing couplings is , the spectrum is the usual one of the bi-scalar theory while if = = the operators are protected because the only remaining interaction vertex is not contributing. -deformed theory: when all the couplings are equal we reduce the full theory to its - deformation. in this case, due of the restoration of one supersymmetry, the operator of twist-two is protected as pointed out in and conrmed by our computation (this reduction in terms of the new couplings and corresponds to and ). the symmetry doesnt constrain the operators of twist-four to be protected, as well as for higher twist t > indeed, their spectrum can be easily read applying the limit, for example at weak coupling, to the expansions ,. the structure constant of the exchanged operators once the spectrum of the exchanged operators is computed, in order to obtain the full set of conformal data for the four point function g, one has to compute the ope coecients. from their denition , we get c,s = c b s+ c r,s , where r,s = d d  hb,s hf ,s hb,s  . here c is given in and one puts o = o = the eigenvalues hb,s and hf ,s are presented in and , and the constants cf = cb = /. plugging these eigenvalues into and performing the derivative, we obtain a rather cumbersome result that we will present in the next paragraph. weak coupling expansion performing the derivative in and substituting the weak coupling expansions of the scaling dimensions computed in and , we obtain the following expansions for the structure constants associated to the exchanged operators for s = c,s = s! ! + [h s h s/][ s +hshs] s +. . . ! c,s = ! p !

numbers. similarly to the expansion of the scaling dimension, the ope coecient of the twist-two operator is singular for s = indeed, as discussed in sec., due to the singularity arising at zero spin, the weak coupling and s limits dont commute. in order to obtain the correct weak coupling expansion for the twist-two operator, one has to set s = in and then expand it in the coupling. the zero spin expansion the ope coecients of exchanged operators reads c, = + i + i + . . . c, = + [ + ] + . . . c, = + + [ + ] + . . . c , = it   t    t  t   t    t  + . . . t = , , , . . . . in analogy with the spectrum analysis, the power counting shows that the twist-two oper- ator goes in power of as expected if s = in the s = case it is going in powers of , suggesting that the weak coupling expansion is sensitive to the double trace counterterms. moreover in both cases and , the twist-four ope coecients are suppressed by a factor of order as compared to those of the twist- strong coupling expansion since we know from the expansion at strong coupling of the scaling dimension that the scaling dimension becomes large, we can expand in the limit and obtain c,s = tan  s   + + + + + +o    , where we have to substitute from the strong coupling spectrum computed in for low-twist operators. naively, the expansion looks the same as the one of the structure constant of the bi-scalar model , but actually it is not. indeed, one can notice from the denition that the ope coecient in our model depends explicitly on the coupling. then in the expansion some coecients at higher order will start to depend on the rst contribution dierent from the bi-scalar expansion appear as / which, after the substitution , contributes at order o in the inverse coupling expansion. hence, it is convenient to write as follows c,s = s+ tan  s  + eik// + +  + eik/ eik/  + . . .  , where k = , , , labels the four solutions of the spectral equation and dots stand for higher orders in / and /. thus, given the scaling dimension , the ope coecient is exponentially small at strong coupling due to the factor the s limit is not singular at strong coupling and one can compute c, directly from . the four-point correlation function once the conformal data in secc. and is computed, one can determine the four-point function by means of . in the case o = o = we obtain g = c b x x g , with the cross-ratios dened as u = x x /(x x ) and v = x x /(x x ) and = the function g can be written in terms of the ope representation as a sum over the non-negative integer lorentz spin s and the states with scaling dimensions . from the study of the spectrum of exchanged operators in sec. it turns out that innitely many operators are exchanged in the ope channel. then we have g = x s= h c,s g,s + c,s g,s + c,s g,s i + + x t=,, x s=  c + ,s g + ,s + c ,s g ,s  , where the scaling dimensions are dened by the spectral equation and computed at weak coupling in , and, and for low twist t = , at strong coupling in . the structure constants c,s associated to the exchanged operators are dened by are computed at weak coupling in and for low twist and strong coupling in . the four-dimensional conformal blocks g,s are dened in . the proper denition of the four-point correlation function g takes into account the symmetrization x x under this symmetry, the cross-ratios transform as u u/v and v /v. correspondingly, from the denition the conformal blocks obey the symmetry g,s = sg,s. combining together this relation with , its easy to see that, imposing the symmetry x x, the terms in with odd s cancel out whereas those with even s get doubled. despite of the presence of singularities in the weak-coupling expansions of scaling dimensions and ope coecients, their combination in is well-dened. indeed, plug- ging the conformal data into , we obtain an expansion in powers of the couplings that is compatible with the interpretation of the correlation function as a sum of feynman diagrams in perturbation theory . in particular, since the rst non-trivial order is xed by the s = conformal data, it is easy to write the very rst contributions to g in terms of the known functions, as follows g = u i u + . . . . where is the ladder three-point function that in the case l = is given by the bloch-wigner dilogarithm function =  + li) + log v u log + v + u + log u log v +  , with

k = , , since the computation of the correlators is the same for any j and k, we will consider the case j = and k = and then the four-point function we want to study takes the following form g = tr[ ]tr[ ]. this correlation function was trivial in the bi-scalar model but in the general double- scaled theory it has a rich diagrammatic structure. indeed a generic feynman diagram in the weak coupling expansion of in the planar limit nc is given by a combi- nation of all the single-trace vertices in and the following double-trace vertex tr[ ] tr[ ] , coming from the counterterm lagrangian . in the following we will compute the conformal data of with the bethe-salpeter method. figure : a feynman diagram contributing to the perturbative expansion g the black squares and dots stand for single- and double-trace vertices respectively. tick lines are bosonic propagators and dashed lines fermionic ones. the colors represent dierent avors j of the particles j and j: in particular black for j = , red for j = and green for j = the propagators are not crossing and are curved to stress the fact that they have a cylindrical topology. the bethe-salpeter method for the correlator g the perturbative expansion of can be written in the following form g = x = g , where g at any perturbative order contains contributions from the bosonic and fermionic integrals, with dierent dependence on couplings. in fig., we present an ex- ample of a generic feynman diagram contributing to . as in the previous case, the feynman diagrams of this four-point correlation function have a cylindric topology and, at arbitrary order , they take an iterative form allowing us to write the full expansion as an innite geometric sum of the primitive divergencies, as in . in contrast to the previous case, the nodes of the chain diagrams in the expansion of g are not only insertions of double-trace vertices but also of the single-trace vertex tr[ ] . in the bethe-salpeter procedure, both vertices enter only as insertions of the operator v dened in . then its easy to conclude, as it was done in for the biscalar shnet model, that the coecient of this operator in is v = where = + . in sec., we discussed the role of the operator v in the computation of the four-point function, arguing that it is not contributing to the spectral equation for nite coupling or s. then, as far as we consider the perturbative expansion in the point-splitting x = x and x = x, we need only to resum the single trace contributions appearing inside the chain links of fig. the contribution given by vertices and is crucial to calculate the xed point . in sec. we will present this computation in detail. x x x x x x x x y y x x x x y y y y x x x x y y y y y y figure : first contributions to the four-point

and cf = cb = /. these diagrams can be expressed in terms of a combination of the hamiltonian graph- building operators hi. indeed, considering the bosonic part of , the bosonic kernel is hb = c b x x x , that is clearly the same as studied in the previous case . the fermionic kernel is more involved. considering the diagrams in fig. and and their integral repre- sentation , it is clear that they are not generated by the same repeated hamiltonian operator. in fact, going on with the perturbative expansion of g , one can notice that at any order for > , at least one fermionic diagram with the following ladder topology appears since any of them carries a power of the coupling, the maximum number of bosonic rungs in the ladder depends on the perturbative order, in particular is however for x

dots represent external points and black dots integration over the full space r > , also the superpositions of ladders with less rungs contribute. for these reasons it is convenient to write the fermionic hamiltonian as a product of sub-kernels associated to the top and bottom parts of the ladder interspersed by n copies of a rungs-building hamiltonian h f = z n+ y i= dyi hb n y j= hrht , where the fermionic sub-kernels hb, hr and ht are contracted in the spin indices in order to recompose the trace of -matrices. in our convention, when n = the rung-building operator hr is not contributing to hf . these hamiltonians, graphically represented in fig., are dened as follows = c bcf ( ) x x x x , ; = cbc f x x x x x , = c f ( ) x x x x x x , and they can be used to rewrite the expansion obtaining g = x c b hb , g = x c b z dydy  hb hb+ + h f hb  , g = x c b z dydy h f hb , where, using the denition , we have h f = z dydy hb h t , h f = z y i= dyih b hr ; h t . the kernels and transform covariantly under conformal transformations, then the corresponding hamiltonian integral operators commute with the generators of the conformal group. the fermionic sub-kernels have spinorial indices carried by the -matrices and transform as two-components spinors. following the conventions we are using for the raising and lowering of spin indices, as explained in app.a, we have the following transformations = , ; = ; , = which corresponds to the exchange . the rung-building operator hr contains a couple of un-contracted -matrices, then it appears with two pairs of indices. in order to build the general fermionic diagram, one has to contract the fermionic sub-kernels with the only constraint to obtain the trace of all the -matrices around the fermionic loop alternating s with s. once chosen if the top sub-kernel ht contains the combination or , the rst rung sub-kernel hr has to have the right combination of indices to be contracted, in particular and respectively. then the other hr kernels have to alternate upper and lower indices. depending on parity of the number of rungs of the ladder n, the bottom sub-kernel hb can carry or . indeed, we can distinguish two dierent index structures, for odd or even number, of repeated applications of hr as follows hn r = (h r ) ; = ; ; ; ; ; (h+ r ) ; = ; (h r ) ; where = , , , . carrying on in the perturbative expansion, one can nd that for example the pertur- bative order = is given by the sum of same combinations of kernels appearing at order = , namely h b, h f hb and h f h b, plus the new kernel h f and so on. for this motivation, the -th perturbative order g cannot be written as the contribution for = to the power as in the case studied in sec., but its sum takes the following form x = g = x c b x k= "" hb + x n= nn n h f #k hb. since the operatorial form of the fermionic hamiltonian in terms of the sub-kernels is h f = hb hn r ht , one can sum the two geometric series in . then the correlator can be written as follows g = x = g = x c b hb hf hb, where hf = x n= nn n h f = hb hr ht , finally, comparing with the denition , we can x the value of the remaining constants i b = , f = . eigenvalues of the hamiltonian graph-building operators in order to compute the four-point correlation function with the operator method presented in sec., one has to obtain the spectrum of the graph-building operators and as was done in sec. for another four-point correlator. the eigenstate that diagonalizes all these hamiltonians is dened in for o = o = and the eigenvalues are dened by means of equations and . substituting in the latter the kernels and and using the denition , we will end up with a set of integrals that can be computed with the help of the star-triangle relations . the fact that all the integrals that we have to compute can be solved by means of the star-triangle relations is a strong evidence of the underlying conformal symmetry. bosonic eigenvalue: since the bosonic hamiltonian is the same as studied in the previous case, its eigenvalue is already computed: it is given by for any s and by in the case of s = fermionic eigenvalue: the fermionic eigenvalue is dened in . in the case we are studying, the hamiltonian operator depends on the number of rungs n, thus its eigenvalue will be also a function of n, as follows h h f ,s,x i = hf ,s ,s,x . the computation of the fermionic spectrum is simpler if we consider the hamiltonian h f in terms of the sub-kernels hb, hr and ht, as in . while the full fermionic hamiltonian is diagonalized by the state ,s,x, the sub-kernels are not. indeed, due to their fermionic structure, individually they will turn the scalar conformal eigenfunction into a fermionic state. however, compatibly with , their combination will leave the state ,s,x unchanged. for instance, at s = when the state is given by the conformal triangle , we have hb hn r ht | {z } h f p p p y y x = hb ( h r ) ; h t p p p y y x = ht hb ( h r ) ; /p p p x y y _ h b ( h+ r ) ; h t p p p y y x = ht h b ( h r ) ; /p p p x y y _ = h r ht hb /p p p x y y _ = hb h r ht p p p y y x = h+ r ht h b /p p p x y y = hb h+ r ht p p p y y x = hb hn r ht | {z } hf ,s p p p x x x where is a non-negative integer, p = /, black and white dots are positions with and without integrations over r, and we dened the state /p p p x x x _ = ( ) x x ,,x, /p p p x x x = x x ,,x in we consider the action of an even and odd number of rung-building operators separately. indeed, while the top sub-kernel is changing the conformal triangle into a fermionic object and the bottom sub-kernel is turning it back to the original state, the n copies of the operator hr are exchanging in the states depending on the parity of n, according to . these arguments hold also in the case of s = , then we have to solve the following equations h h t ,s,x i = ht,s ( ) x x ,s,x ,  h ; r y y ,s,x  = hr,s ( ) x x ,s,x , "" h b y y ,s,x # = hb,s ,s,x , and the same for the transformed kernels by means of . considering the rst two equations of and the denitions , we have h h t ,s,x i =c f z dydy ( ) y y ,s,x =cf cb  h ; r y y ,s,x  , then, looking at , we can conclude that hr,s = cb cf ht,s . moreover, focusing on the last equation of and the denition of bottom sub-kernel given in , we have "" h b y y ,s,x # = c bcf z dydy ,s,x y , where we used equation to simplify the fermionic structure. the integral in the right-hand side of the equation is the same as appearing in the computation of the bosonic eigenvalue related to the operator hb given by . then eq. together with and leads to hb,s = cf c b hb,s , where hb,s corresponds to for any s and in the s = case. with these arguments it is clear that, in order to compute the fermionic eigenvalue of the operator , we need only to compute the eigenvalue ht,s dened by the rst equation in . in the s = case the computation of ht,s can be performed using only star-triangle relation . indeed starting from the integral together with the rst equation of and performing two fermionic star-triangle integrations, as follows  str =  str =  , we obtain ht, = c f . plugging , and in the denition we have hf , = hb, n ht, = (cbc f )n+ n+n+ . the computation of the eigenvalue ht,s for s = is more involved. without any loss of generality, we can consider the limit x in both sides of the rst equation of in order to simplify the spin structure. in this limit we are able to compute the resulting integral going to momentum space. we leave the details of the computation in app.d. going through the calculation we obtain . notice that also this eigenvalue can be written in terms of the bosonic one as follows ht,s = c f c b + s hb,s , where hb,s is given in . substituting , and into the denition we have hf ,s =hb,s n ht,s =  c f c b n+ n+ hb,s = (cbc f )n+ n+ n+ , where in the last line we used the denition . notice that setting s = we ob- tain as expected. finally, using the denition , we can resum the fermionic eigenvalue obtaining hf ,s = c f hb,s c b c bc f jj+hb,s . we can conclude that the eigenvalue is manifestly invariant under , as expected from . spectrum of exchanged operators of g in this section we will use the eigenvalues and to compute the scaling di- mensions of the operators contributing to the correlation function for o = and o = the spectrum of the exchanged operators is dened by the solutions of the equation for the physical poles . substituting in the denition of bosonic and fermionic eigenvalues and and the constants i computed in , we can rearrange the spectral equation in the following form hb,s + c f hb,s c b c bc f hb,s = , where we dened the new couplings = = . plugging into , we obtain the following equation + s++ = with the additional constraint im < for physical, exchange operators. equation has solutions for s = four of them correspond to the scaling di- mensions of physical operators satisfying this constraint. indeed, they are two couple of solutions with bare dimension + s and + s. the remaining four solutions are related to the rst ones by the transformation and describe shadow operators with re < in the s = case has solutions. one corresponds to the operator with bare dimension and two to the one with bare dimension the remaining three solutions are their shadow operators. this th order equation in can be solved exactly, but instead of these bulky formulas we prefer to present their perturbative expansions at weak and strong coupling. the equation can be viewed as dening an algebraic curve of th degree in terms of , or of the corresponding dimension = + i as a complex variable. in terms of variable it is a th order algebraic curve whose branches the four sheets of the related riemann surface describe directly the four physical dimensions as functions of couplings. changing the couplings we can pass from one sheet to another, observing the transitions between various dimensions. the branch points correspond to the collisions of physical dimensions. in contrast to this case, the spectral equation for the previous four-point function is not algebraic and its riemann surface contains innitely many sheets. weak coupling expansion: expanding around the physical pole = is/ at weak coupling , , we obtain the following expansions of dimensions for the two twist-two operators = + s "" p

the expansions since the following ones are quite cumbersome. moreover, we notice that the weak coupling expansions of the solutions are divergent but, as we point out later, by the analysis of sec. the sum of the corresponding ope contributions has a well dened expansion . taking into account the quantum numbers of the external state tr[ ] we can list the operators of twist- and - which mix, obtaining the expression for the exchanged operators in the ope from the diagonalization of the mixing matrix. at s = we recognize that tr[ s + ] and tr[ s + ], where n n = and + = , operators can mix if s > interestingly, due to trace ciclicity, at twist-, the mixing transitions are symmetric and then there are no logarithmic operators despite chiral interactions of . on the other hand, at s = many more operators can realise the u quantum numbers , building up a large mixing matrix. as pointed out in app.f., already for s = the anomalous dimension matrix is not diagonalizable. we con- jecture there that its canonical jordan form presents several logarithmic multiplets (jordan blocks) of various ranks, together with two non-zero diagonal elements, corresponding to solutions and s = ). the zero-spin case presents some peculiar behaviors. indeed, expanding for s = around the physical poles = at weak coupling, we obtain the following expansion for the twist-two operator s= = i p + + i p + + i / + . . . and around the pole = i the following twist-four operators = + h + p i + "" + p # + . . . = + h p i + "" + + p # + . . . the fact that at s = there is only one solution corresponding to operators of length-two is not surprising: the only scalar operator which has twist- and the correct quantum numbers is indeed tr[ ], that is the one exchanged in the ope channel . moreover, similarly to the case of the spectrum of the length-two operator in the correlation function computed in sec., the limit s and the weak-coupling limit are not commutative, thus the scaling dimension for s = presents a dierent expansion in power of the coupling w.r.t. the case s > the explanation is the same of the previous case. indeed, since the physical pole is situated at = is/, and the mirror pole at = +is/, at weak coupling, when s , they pinch the integration contour of at the origin producing a divergence. hence, the contribution of the double-traces is needed in this case to produce a non-vanishing term that cancels this divergence at weak coupling. again we stress that at nite couplings the solutions are well-dened even at zero spin. strong coupling expansion: equation has solutions at strong coupling i.e. for , . the explanation of the fact that we have a dierent number of solutions limit cft + s + s bi bi bi-scalar i k i, k + s + s -deform = = = table : in this table we summarize the operator and dimension content of exchange operators in three reductions of cft for the correlator g in our notation = ( , ) and bi is dened in . w.r.t the weak coupling case

all the strong coupling expan- sions are growing linearly with . the s limit is not singular at strong coupling, then one can compute s= directly from . the spectrum of exchanged operators in reductions of cft the scaling di- mensions of the exchanged operators in the correlation function g for the reductions of cft introduced in sec., can be computed as solutions of the spectral equation in which we are applying the limits on the couplings, or even directly on the weak- and strong-coupling expansions. in tab. we summarize our results. cft: sending one of the couplings to zero we perform the reduction from the full cft to the cft. in this case, the reduction doesnt give a unique spectrum. indeed, setting or to zero, or equivalently , we obtain two protected oper- ators. this is clear when considering the spectral equation in which only the rst term on the left-hand side will contribute and clearly it describes two protected solutions . if we consider to vanish, or equivalently , and again referring to the spectral equation , it is clear that the second term in the left-hand side vanishes but, in contrast to the previous case, in the right-hand side of the equation the dependence on the coupling is still present. the resulting equation is the same as describing the spectrum of exchanged operators for the four-point function g in the bi-scalar theory. then we obtain solutions with the spectrum given by where = . bi-scalar theory: the reduction to bi-scalar theory consists of the limit in which two couplings of cft vanish. for the correlator we are considering, any choice of the vanishing couplings leads to protected solutions, as expected. indeed, in the bi-scalar theory the lack of interaction vertices doesnt develop an anomalous dimension for exchanged operators with external states given by and as previously noticed in . -deformed theory : in this case, the restoration of one supersymmetry is not sucient to constrain any of the solutions. then their spectrum can be easily read oapplying the equal couplings limit, for example at weak coupling, to the expansions and . the structure constant of the exchanged operators once the spectrum of the exchanged operators is computed, in order to obtain the full set of conformal data for the four point function g , one has to compute the ope coecients. their denition is given by or, equivalently, by where r,s = d d  hb,s + hb,s hb,s  , where the eigenvalues hb,s is dened in and the constants cf = cb = /. plugging the eigenvalues into and performing the derivative, we obtain explicit but rather cumbersome result that we will not present here. in the following paragraphs we will consider its weak- and strong- coupling expansions. weak coupling expansion substituting the weak coupling expansions of the scaling dimensions computed in into ,, we obtain the following weak coupling expansions for the structure constants associated to the twist-two operators for s = c,s = s ( + p s) [( + p s) ] + . . . c,s = s ( p s) [( p s) ] + . . . , and a similar substitution of for the twist-four operators at any s gives c,s = ( p )( + p ) s+ p [( p ) ] + . . . c,s = ( p )( + p ) s+ p [( + p ) ] + . . . . where the functions and are dened in . similarly to the expansion of the scaling dimensions, the ope coecients of the twist-two operators are singular for s = indeed, as discussed in sec., due to the singularity arising at zero spin, the weak coupling and s limits dont commute. in order to obtain the correct weak coupling expansion for the twist-two operators, one has to set s = in and then expand in the couplings. in the s = case we found that the spectral equation has solutions instead of , as expected from the operator mixing analysis in app.f. for twist- solutions. in particular the zero spin expansion of the structure constant related to the twist-two operator is c, = + i p + "" + + i p + # + . . . . since the s singularity is not arising for the twist four operators, one can read othe spinless ope coecients for the twist-four operators directly setting s = in , thus obtaining c, = p [+ p ] / + . . . c, = p + [++ p ] / + . . . . in analogy with the analysis of spectrum, the divergence arising at s = for the twist- two operators suggests that the weak coupling expansion is sensitive to the double trace counterterms. moreover, for any s the twist-four ope coecients are suppressed by a factor of order / as compared to the twist-two ones. strong coupling expansion in sec. we studied the strong coupling spectrum of the exchanged operator for the four-point function g since the scaling dimensions are growing linearly with the coupling , the ope coecients can be computed expanding and in and then plugging the strong coupling asymptotics of scaling dimensions in the resulting expansion. since in this limit the coecient c in is dominant w.r.t. the one of , the rst terms of the expansion are exactly the same as in . obviously at higher orders in /, starts contributing and then we obtain c ,s = tan s ! + i + + . . .  , c ,s = tan s ! + + i + + . . .  , c ,s = tan s ! + + + i + . . .  . thus, given the linear growth of the scaling dimensions with coupling, the ope co- ecients are exponentially small at strong coupling. the s limit is not singular at strong coupling, thus one can compute c, directly from expansion , setting there s = the four-point correlation function once we computed the conformal data in sec. and sec., we can determine the four- point function by means of . in the case o = and o = we obtain g = c b x x g . the cross-ratios are dened as u = x x /(x x ) and v = x x /(x x ) and i = the function g can be written in terms of the ope representation as a sum over the non-negative integer lorentz spin s and the states with scaling dimensions . from the study of the spectrum of exchanged operators in sec. it turns out that in the ope channel two operators of length-two for s = are exchanged, but only one when s = thus, in order to write the four point function in a compact form, we set c,s to vanish at s = , or equal to otherwise, then we have g = x s= , where the scaling dimensions are dened by the spectral equation . at weak coupling they are computed in and , and at strong coupling in . the structure constants are dened by and . they are computed at weak and strong coupling in , and respectively. the four-dimensional conformal blocks g,s are dened . as already pointed out for the four-point correlator g, the proper denition of the four-point correlation function g , takes into account the symmetrization x x under this symmetry, the cross-ratios transform as u u/v and v /v and correspond- ingly, from the denition , the conformal blocks g,s = sg,s. combining together this relation with , its easy to see that including the symmetry x x means that the terms in with odd s cancel out whereas those with even s get doubled. despite the presence of singularities in the weak-coupling expansions of scaling dimen- sions and ope coecients, their sum in is well-dened and non-singular. indeed plugging the conformal data into , we obtain an expansion in powers of the couplings that is compatible with the interpretation of the correlation function as a sum of feynman diagrams in perturbation theory . in particular, since the rst non-trivial order is xed by the s = conformal data, it is easy to write the two leading contributions to g in terms of known functions as follows g = u + i p + u + . . . . where is the bloch-wigner dilogarithm function dened in . expanding at higher order in the couplings we obtain a cumbersome result. however, we notice that the maximum transcendental weight of the involved functions grows linearly with the order. this suggest, together with the presence of the bloch-wigner dilogarithm at the rst non- trivial order, the possibility to interpret the four-point function as a combination of a class of special iterated integrals, the so-called harmonic polylogarithms following the same idea as of . correlation functions at weak coupling from feynman diagrams in sec. and sec., we have analyzed two dierent four-point functions computing their conformal data by means of the bethe-salpeter method. with this procedure we were able to diagonalize the graph-building operators and write exact equations for the spectrum of exchanged operators even though we ignored on the way the contribution of the double- trace interactions . the double-trace counterterms are necessary in the action to have a consistent description of the double-scaled theory in the perturbative regime and in particular for the restoration of conformal symmetry. in this section, we will study the weak coupling expansions of the four-point functions related to the operators and clarify the role of the double-trace terms for this expan- sion. as we already mentioned, bosonic and fermionic wrappings in the related feynman graphs develop uv divergencies at short distances. adding the double-trace vertices in the perturbative expansion we will be able to determine the conformal xed points canceling divergencies generated by the single trace terms. however, they will not aect the nite coupling solutions computed in the section above. the double-trace counterterms are given by the lagrangian . in general, this action contains terms but, due of the cylindric topology of feynman diagrams for the observables we are computing. for any four-point function only one double-trace term is contributing generating a new local four-scalar vertex . this fact is crucial to ensure that conformal symmetry is restored. indeed, in this case we know that the -function can be written as and it admits two xed points jas in . if we focus on the feynman diagram expansion of the four point-functions we have to deal with divergent integrals. then we have to introduce dimensional regularization setting d = one important observation is that the diagrams containing fermionic contribu- tions produce the same divergence as the bosonic ones. in other words the fermionic kernels contains the divergent part of the bosonic one plus a remainder function that is nite in d = which therefore does not require regularization. then the divergent operator can be written as h v i =c b z dydy h hb i =c b z dydy [y ] , where is a test function. given the hamiltonians and the denition , the four-point correlation func- tion is dened as follows g = lim  cb x o+od x, x| hb v v b hb f hf |x, x, where the eective coupling v = v| j= j, i.e. it is taken at the xed point j = j. it is clear that for = conformal symmetry is broken. however, expanding at weak-coupling in terms of feynman diagrams, one can demonstrate order-by-order how conformal symmetry is restored. in the following sections, we present some examples of this mechanism for the four-point correlation functions associated to the operators . four-point function of o = and o = lets start from this simplistic example. consider o = j and o = k=j with j, k = , , since the correlators are the same for any j and k, we choose j = and k = then the four-point function we want to study is as follows g = trtr[ ]. in the planar limit nc , the weak coupling expansion of in terms of feynman diagrams is given by a combination of the following vertices tr tr , tr[ ] , and it can be written as follows g = x = ( + )g , where represents the perturbative order. it is straightforward to see that feynman diagrams at any order form a chain structure alternating groups of single- and double- trace vertices. these vertices insert into the graphs identical primitive divergencies. then at the conformal critical point = the graphs cancel each other except for the = term, namely g = c b x x . restoring the two point function in the limit x x and x x we notice that the spectrum of the operator tr is not aected by quantum corrections. indeed, its scaling dimension is protected and equal to the bare one = . four-point function of o = o = in sec. we studied the contribution to the four-point function g of diagrams gener- ated by the bosonic and fermionic hamiltonians hb and hf but ignored the double-trace x x x x y x x y y x x figure : first two contributions of the double trace vertex trtr[ ] to the four-point functions g vertices, which works well for nite couplings. since any diagram in fig. (except for the trivial leading order diagram) is uv divergent, we will re-introduce in this section the double-trace counterterms in the perturbative expansion in order to make the weak- coupling expansion uv nite and to restore conformal symmetry. lets compute the rst few orders of the weak coupling expansion of g in terms of feynman diagrams, we have to compute the graphs given in figg. and dening a function g where a counts the number of double-trace vertices, b the number of bosonic vertices and c the number of fermionic vertices , we have g=g + g +[ g +( + )g + g ]+. . . . the leading order g is already dened in , thus g = g the rst correction is given by the diagram in fig. this contribution is nite and it can be written as follows g = c b x x u , where is the ladder three-point function that in the case l = is given by the bloch-wigner dilogarithm function =  + li) + log v u log + v + u + log u log v +  , with p uv and u v + . the cross-ratios are u = x x /(x x ) and v = x x /(x x ) and the constant cb = /. the bosonic part of the two-loop correction given by g and g comes from the diagrams in figg., and the corresponding integrals are divergent and they need dimensional regularization, then we have g = c bi , and g = c bi , where we dened the short-hand notation i = z dydy [y ] . this integral is uv divergent at short distances y using the identity /(y ) = / + o, one can compute the divergent part of the integral that is proportional to the same one-loop function found in , as follows g + ( + )g = c b x x  + +  u + nite , where for the purpose of this section we are not interested in the nite part. let us nally consider the fermionic contribution g . this term corresponds to the feynman diagram in fig. and its integral representation in four dimensions is given in the last line of . since we are only interested in the computation of the uv divergent part of the diagram, we can avoid computing the whole integral in dimensional regularization and proceed in a more naive way. indeed, representing the integral as in the last line of and considering that the fermionic hamiltonian can be written as a combination of the bosonic one and some nite reminder function as in , we know that all the uv divergence is arising from hb. then we can write g = c b x x u + nite . combining this result with and , we obtain that the expansion takes the expected form with the function g given by g = u + u + + u + nite + . . . , where the new couplings and are dened in and nite stands for the nite part of g at two-loop. finally, imposing the uv niteness of the correlation function we obtain the rst order of the xed point as follows = i + . . . , and notice that it matches exactly the prediction given in . replacing the double- trace coupling in with its value = i we obtain the one-loop expansion of the correlation function as follows g = u i u + . . . . this perfectly matches the same quantity computed via ope, with conformal data xed by the bethe-salpeter method . four-point function of o = and o = in sec., we studied the four-point function g by the bethe-salpeter method, consid- ering the diagrams generated by bosonic and fermionic hamiltonians hb and h f , but ignoring the operator v, which is valid at any nite couplings. since we want to analyze this choice is coherent with the sign convention used in sec.. x x x x y x x y y x x figure : first two contributions of the double- and single-trace vertices tr[ ]tr[ ] and tr[ ] to the four-point functions g the weak coupling perturbative expansion of the correlator using feynman diagrams, the graphs generated by this operator are needed in order to cancel the uv divergencies arising from the diagrams in fig. there is here a substantial dierence w.r.t. the case of g studied in sec.: indeed the diagrams generated by v are not only produced by the double- trace vertex tr[ ]tr[ ] but also by the single-trace tr[ ]. for this reason, we redene the double-trace coupling as taking into account both contributions. lets compute the rst few orders of the weak coupling expansion of g in terms of feynman diagrams, we have to compute the rst three graphs given in fig. and the ones in fig. dening the function g where a counts the number of double- and single-trace vertices contributing with coupling and b and c the number of bosonic and fermionic vertices, respectively, we have g =g + g + [ g + g + g ]+ . . . where the new couplings and are dened by and = + the leading order g is already dened in then g = g the rst correction is given by the diagram in fig. that is a half of the one computed in the previous section in . the bosonic part of the two-loop correction given by g and g comes from the diagrams in fig. and fig. and they are divergent. their integral representation is exactly the same as in the previous case, namely , and then we can write their sum as follows g + g = c b x x  +  u + nite . lets nally consider the fermionic contribution g . this term corresponds to the feynman diagram in fig. and its integral representation in four dimensions is given in the next-to-the-last line of . in this case, our goal is also to identify the uv divergent part of the diagram. thus we will not compute the whole integral in in dimensional regularization but we will rather proceed following the method of the previous section. performing two integrations by means of the star-triangle relation and then simplifying the spin structure with the help of and , one can identify a divergent the two diagrams have a dierent symmetry factor given by the wick contractions. integral of the same kind as in , together with a nite remainder integral. computing the integral i for small distances y , we can extract the following pole g = c bc f x x u + nite . combining all this results, we obtain that the expansion takes the expected form with the function g given by g = u+ u + + + u +nite+. . . where nite stands for the nite part of g at two-loop. finally, imposing the uv niteness of the correlation function and recalling the denition , we obtain the rst order of the xed point as follows = i p + + . . . . replacing the eective coupling in with its value = i p + , we obtain the one-loop expansion of the correlation function in the following form g = u + i p + u + . . . , that perfectly matches the same quantity computed via ope with conformal data xed by the bethe-salpeter method . conclusion and discussion this paper represents an attempt of a deeper understanding of physical properties and analytic structure of the four-dimensional, three-coupling chiral cft the cft proposed by o. g urdo gan and one of the authors in as a double scaling limit of - deformed n = sym theory, combining the weak coupling with the strong imaginary -twist. we study here two aspects of this cft with three eective couplings, given by the lagrangian : i) the explicit description of the feynman graph content of the perturbative expansion, partially uncovering their integrability properties; ii) the exact computation, via conformal symmetry, of two four-point correlation functions of shortest protected scalar operators of the theory. as concerns the planar feynman graphs content of the theory, we found here the complete description of possible feynman graphs in the bulk inside a generic big feynman graph, far from its boundaries dened by a particular studied physical quantity. these graphs can be dubbed as dynamical shnet, since, unlike the usual regular shnet of the bi-scalar model they have a certain dynamics (summation over many of such graphs) preserving at the same time a kind of irregular shnet structure shown on figg. , interestingly, this bulk structure is neatly realized as feynman graphs describing arbitrary this choice is coherent with the sign convention used in sec.. the name cft was suggested in single-trace correlation functions of all elementary elds, as shown on figg. , it would be very interesting to nd the realisation of the yangian symmetry of these correlators, and of the related planar amplitudes , generalizing the results of for the bi-scalar cft. it would be the neatest demonstration of the integrability of the full model. in sec. we demonstrate such integrability in the two-coupling reduction of the full cft, having a much simpler shnet structure (combination of regular brick wall graphs with yukawa vertices and regular square lattice shnets). a considerably more involved analysis of the integrability of the full dynamical shnet of cft, in particular, via the yangian symmetry of single-trace correlators, is underway. we believe that it will be another important step to the understanding of integrability of the mother theory the n = sym . it is worth noticing here that -deformation represents a rather mild, topological modication of the planar graphs of original n = sym , altering only the boundaries of these graphs, and not the bulk. in the second part of our paper, we managed to compute two non-trivial four point correlation functions of elementary elds of the full three coupling cft, generalizing the bi-scalar shnet cft results of . as in these papers, we employed the bethe- salpeter method and the conformal symmetry to do the computations, but the procedure is more complicated and the corresponding analytic structures, both in coordinate and in the coupling spaces, are considerably richer, due to a more dynamical nature of the involved feynman graphs. a new phenomenon presented in the correlators of the full theory is the non-perturbative behavior of certain individual ope data anomalous dimensions and structure constants of exchange operators, in the weak coupling limit. but the perturbative behavior of the four point correlator is restored in the sum over all ope terms. the equations on the anomalous dimensions, obtained from the pole structure of integrands in spectral decomposition of these correlators, appear to have a few interesting singularities in the coupling space, whose physical signicance for the theory is left to understand. we also demonstrate the relevance of the double-trace terms for the correct feynman graph interpretation of our results obtained via bethe-salpeter conformally symmetric procedure. to get a further insight to these intereting chiral cfts, we have to compute more complicated correlation functions, involving the exchanged operators of higher r-charges, such as trl , or even more complicated multi-magnon operators. for the moment, only the exact anomalous dimensions of l = case of such operators and of some related operators with the same r-charge have been computed for bi-scalar shnet cft in via the double-scaling limit of the qsc equations. similar results on l = , and magnon operators will be reported in . not much is yet done in this direction for the full cft, apart from the aba approach of to long operators l and the one-loop study of , as well as the results of the current paper on the shortest exchange operators. as concerns the study of the structure constants, the rst all-loop results for multi-magnon operators in bi-scalar shnet cft have been obtained in the very recent paper . the generalization to four-point functions and to more complicated operators, and to the full in the sense that the exact baxter equation, together with its quantisation condition was obtained and studied perturbatively, to many loops, and numerically, to a veryally arbitrary precision cft, will necessitate a considerable new insight into integrability properties of these models. the generalization of bi-scalar shnet cft to any dimension d poses a natural question whether the d-dimensional generalization of the full -coupling cft exists. a related question: can we generalize the basso-dixon type shnet integrals the four-point single-trace correlators of scalar elds in bi-scalar cft explicitly computed in d = and d = , to the case of dynamical shnets of cft? it would be also interesting to understand the behavior of large feynman graphs in the full cft, in-line with the early results of and the recent observations of for the shnet reduction of the cft. in particular, if the -model interpretation of the latter paper can be generalized to the full cft, it could be a big step in the explicit construction of the ads dual of this chiral cft, if such one exists at all after the double scaling limit of -deformed n = sym theory. as a nal comment: it would be interesting to nd a realisation of these non-unitary theories in physical systems, if not in the fundamental quantum eld theory (at least as an eective theory) than my be for certain statistical-mechanical and, presumably non- equilibrium, condensed matter models. the beautiful mathematical structures behind the cft promises more of such applications in the future. acknowledgements we are thankful to j. caetano, s.

of the fermionic graph-building operator ht in this section, we compute the relevant part of the fermionic eigenvalue h f dened in which is involved in the computation of the four-point function g . the eigenfunction of the fermionic operator is determined, as usual, by the conformal representation of external elds, thus it corresponds to . as shown in sec., the action of the sub-kernels ht, hr and hb transforms the conformal triangle to a new one, adding a factor / x/x, with chirality depending on the number n of sub-kernels we apply. moreover, since the spectrum of hb is the same as of the bosonic operator and the spectrum of hr is expressed through the one for ht , the latter is the only operator we have to study. the goal of this appendix is to compute the eigenvalue ht,s dened by the rst equation of at any s. first we send x in order to simplify the spin struc- tures in both sides of the equation. in this limit the state is ,s,x s/(x )p where p = / using the integral

validity of equation we should show that the physical poles given by the zeroes of the spectral equation are the only contributions to the four- point correlators under study. this fact, well known for the bi-scalar reduction of our theory , needs a proof for the full cft. it appears that additional possible contributions could come from the extra poles in g,s and the measure factor /c in this appendix we will show that these contributions cancel each other thanks to a symmetry relation fullled by the eigenvalues hi ,s of the bethe-salpeter kernels. the conformal block g,s has simple poles at sn = s + n (with n = , , . . . , s), namely in = s + n. its residue at the pole = n is given by rn gs+,sn where : rn = n in       . this results in the following extra contribution to : rg s,m =  rm c hb sm,s bhb sm,s fhf sm,s  gs+,sm , n s < . in addition to that, the measure factor /c develops poles at = s + + k, k = , , , . . . . the corresponding contribution can be expressed as rc s,k =  rk c hb s+k,s bhb s+k,s fhf s+k,s  gs++k,s , s, k < . the overall contribution of these terms is the sum over all non-negative integers s, k of the generic term rc s,k + rg s+k,k =  rk c gs++k,s   hb s+k,s bhb s+k,s fhf s+k,s hb s,s+k bhb s,s+k fhf s,s+k  . a possible vanishing condition for the full contribution is then rk = for any k n. we can actually verify in both sectors under study that the following set of stronger conditions is fullled rk = , k = , , , . . . rk = , k = , , , . . . . it is easy to check that plugging into , one is left with the condition , which means that together with are a sucient condition for . to prove these equations hold, we notice rst of all that at = = vanishes at odd n, so it would be sucient to prove , at even k n. moreover, equation has been checked in , where it was enough to state the cancelation of spurious poles in tr[ ] sector. let us verify the second condition at even integer k. starting from the sector tr[ ] it is equivalent to hf +s+k,s hf +s,s+k = , where we recalled the denition of hf ,s . equation actually coincides with the vanishing condition for spurious contribution in the one-magnon tr[ ] sector of bi-scalar theory, and is veried in . we can nally check for the sector tr[ ]. recalling that in this case hf ,s = c f hb,s c b c bc f jj+hb,s , and that hb+s+k,s = hb+s,s+k, as we already know from , we are left to verify that =+s+k, s=s = =+s, s=s+k , which is trivially true for any integer k. f operator mixing and logarithmic multiplet in both sectors tr[ ] and tr[ ] of our theory the exchanged physical operators in the ope s-channel of the -point correlators under analysis present mixing. namely, due to the wide matter content of the theory, the renormalized operators are not just rescaled and normal-ordered monomials of elementary elds and derivatives, but linear coupling- dependant combination of several such terms which share the same symmetries. concretely, in our theory we deal with single trace primary operators as o = tr , made up of elementary elds of the theory ik eventually dressed by tensor structures and derivatives. given the quantum numbers of such a term o, that is cartans u charge, twist and tensor rank s, it is usually possible to write a few other conformal primaries with the same numbers, say {o, o . . . }. this allows in general some of the two- point functions oiojto not vanish at i = j, that is to have transitions oi oj. we dene the anomalous dimension matrix ij as d d zoi = ij zoj , being zoi the renormalization of operator oi and the scale. in absence of transitions, namely ij = iji, mixing does not happen and each operator oi has anomalous dimension i. otherwise, one has to bring the mixing matrix ij into diagonal form via a rotation over the basis of local primaries {o, o . . . }. the operators of the new basis are linear combinations of the kind o i = c,i o + c,i o + . . . and they do not mix among each other. the anomalous dimension of o i is the corre- sponding eigenvalue of the matrix, namely i. the existence of a basis of eigenvectors for ij-matrix is ensured by its hermiticity in unitary theories. the absence of invariance under hermitian conjugation of prevent to come to similar conclusions for cft theory. in particular, performing the planar limit can lead to one-way transitions oioj= oioj= , and the correspondent mixing matrix can be only brought into jordan canonical form, e.g. for the mixing of four primaries: ij ij = . the matrix contains a jordan block, together with two diagonal terms and , corresponding to two renormalized operators with such anomalous dimensions. the physical interpretation of jordan blocks leads to the formulation of logarithmic cft (see ,). in the example the block corresponds to a rank- logarithmic multiplet. this means that the corresponding operators of the new basis, o , o show -point func- tions of the kind o o = k ln o o= k o o = k o o = , where is the bare dimension of oi operators, and the energy scale. this phenomenon, the presence of log-multiplets in cft has rst be noticed by j.caetano for its bi- scalar reduction and some examples of its occurance in the context of fishnet cft have been presented in . despite such logarithmic operators appear in our theory, we are mostly interested in selecting the non-logarithmic ones: indeed these are the only exchanged in the ope of the correlators under study, as the solutions of spectral equations and correspond to non-protected operators = f. tr[ ] sector this rst sector is characterized by the cartan r-charge of two elds . the equation shows physical solutions for every even twist. in particular there is only one solution at twist- , and two at twist- and higher both for spin s = and s > the twist- solution is easily interpreted as the scaling dimension of tr + permutations s = , , . . . , indeed for any s there is no other twist- conformal primary with charge . on the other hand for s = t we can list several primaries with the right set of cartans charges. let us concentrate on the scalar case s = of twist four; we nd scalar conformal primaries which have the right set of charges o = tr[ ] oj = tr[ j j] o+j = tr[ jj] o+j = tr[j j] o = tr[ ] o = tr[ ], j = , as also the structure of shows, this sector is fully described in terms of the cft, thus the mixing transitions are realized by the vertices of . at any coupling o shows no planar transitions, and we deal with a set of conformal primaries which at non-zero couplings , mix among themselves. this fact is apparently in contrast with the presence of only two twist- exchanged operators in the ope expansion of sec., and can be explained with the arising of logarithmic multiplets of operators with = = , not being solutions of . indeed, for instance, the following planar transitions o+j o, o o o, o, can happen respectively starting from order and , while they lack the hermitian conjugate due to chirality of . one can actually check that there is no conjugate transition to at any order. this suggest that matrix ij wont be diagonalizable and presents jordan blocks in its canonical form, i.e. logarithmic operators. f. tr[ ] sector in this sector the cartans u charge is the dierence between those of and , that is . the solutions of equation are three in the scalar case s = , one of twist- and two of twist- . interestingly, for tensors s > there is an additional solution of twist- . the explanation of such dierence is that there is a unique way to realize a scalar = operator with charge, that is tr[ ], while for higher rank tensors s > two operators can mix up. starting from s = we nd that in addition to tr[ ], the operator tr[ ] = tr[ (n )] satisfy the constraint of quantum numbers and behave as an so vector. therefore operator mixing happens among two conformal primaries o = tr[s ] and o = tr[s ] , at any s n+. indeed, being interested in symmetric traceless tensors , no other bilinear covariant made of fermions can enter the game at higher s. the allowed planar transitions are: o o o o , together with the diagonal terms oio i , for i = , dealing with single trace operators made of two elementary elds the eect of chiral interaction is cancelled by the trace cyclicity. the resulting transitions are symmetric and the anomalous dimension matrix is diagonalizable. recalling the couplings redenition and , its rst perturbative order should coincide with: ij = ij =  s   + s  . as a result the two physical operators exchanged in the ope of have the form o = c,so +  c,s  o , and correspond to solutions . at twist-, there are already for the scalar case s = several local operators satisfying the constraints of bare dimension = and cartans charge . we can compactly list them oj = tr[ j j] oj+ = tr[ jj] oj+ = tr[ j j] j = , , o = tr[ ] o = tr[ ] o = tr[ ] o = tr[ ] o = tr[ ] o = tr o = tr . at non-zero couplings {, , } these operators mix into linear combinations obtained by the analysis of their transitons. as it happens in the rst sector , one can check that the eect of chiral interaction breaks the hermiticity of ij matrix, preventing its diagonalization. its associated jordan canonical form ij will contain several log-multiplets of various rank, together with two diagonal elements, the anomalous dimensions . references r. rattazzi, v. s. rychkov, e.

summary, the text discusses the mixing of F Operators and logarithmic multiplets in the context of quantum conformal field theories. Conformal field theories are of significant importance for various subjects in physics, such as critical phenomena and interactions beyond the standard model. The text highlights the mathematical structure that allows insights into quantum field theory and quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT duality. Progress has been made using conformal bootstrap methods and the analytic study of superconformal QFTs, particularly in higher dimensions. Integrability plays a crucial role, allowing for the exact calculation of anomalous dimensions, local operators, and correlation functions. The text explores the properties and spectrum of operators in logarithmic CFTs, shedding light on the non-perturbative structure of strongly interacting CFTs in higher dimensions. The study of correlation functions reveals the intricate dynamical properties of the theory, with a focus on planar Feynman graphs and lattice structures. The spectral problem exact calculation and analysis point to a mysterious yet intriguing integrability in the N = SYM theory.

The text also introduces a family of non-unitary and non-supersymmetric CFTs based on a special double-scaling limit of the N = SYM theory, named Chiral CFT. The Chiral CFT provides insights into the origins of integrability in the N = SYM theory, facilitating computations of physical properties like OPE data and multi-loop Feynman graphs. The integrability of the N = SYM theory remains a somewhat mysterious phenomenon, particularly on the CFT side of the AdS/CFT duality. The study of correlation functions and Feynman graphs offers a unique perspective on the non-perturbative structure of strongly interacting CFTs and the general properties of CFTs in higher dimensions. The existence of dimensional analogs obtained through special limits from the 3D ABJM model and the D-dimensional Shnet CFT is also highlighted.

To summarize, the text delves into the intricacies of F Operator mixing and logarithmic multiplets in the context of quantum conformal field theories, exploring their mathematical structures, dualities, integrability, and implications for understanding strongly interacting CFTs in various dimensions."

involving higher order multipolar de- grees of freedom are historically referred to as hidden orders due to the formidable task of detecting them with conventional probes. examples of such hidden orders include spin-nematic order in quan- tum magnets, and quadrupolar or higher multipolar orders in various correlated quantum materials. in this work, we theoretically propose that the study of magnetostriction provides a powerful and novel tool to directly detect higher-order multipolar symmetry breaking such as the elusive octupolar order by examining its scaling be- haviour with respect to an applied magnetic eld h. as an illustra- tive example, we examine such key scaling signatures in the context of pr-based cage compounds with strongly correlated f-electrons, pr, whose low energy degrees of freedom are com- posed of purely higher-order multipoles: quadrupoles o, and octupole txyz. employing a symmetry-based landau theory of mul- tipolar moments coupled to lattice strain elds, we demonstrate that a magnetic eld applied along the direction results in a length change with a distinct linear-in-h scaling behaviour, accompanied by hysteresis, below the octupolar ordering temperature. we show that the resulting magnetostriction coefcient is directly proportional to the octupolar order parameter, providing the rst clear access to this subtle order parameter. along other eld directions, we show that the eld dependence of the magnetostriction provides a window into quadrupolar orders. our work provides a springboard for future experimental and theoretical investigations of multipolar orders and their quantum phase transitions in a wide variety of systems. hidden order | multipolar ordering | octupolar ordering | magne- tostriction | landau theory i n crystalline solids, the combination of spin-orbit coupling and crystal electric elds places strong constraints on the shape of localized electronic wavefunctions . the quan- tum mechanically dened multipole moments provide a useful measure of the resulting complex angular distribution of the magnetization and charge densities . most conventional broken symmetry phases in solids involve the magnetic dipole moment of the electron. remarkably, a large class of strongly correlated electron materials display nontrivial higher order multipolar moments, e.g., quadrupolar or octupolar moments, whose uctuations and ordering leads to a rich variety of phases such as quadrupolar heavy fermi liquids , super- conductivity , and unusual multipolar symmetry-broken phases . while multipolar ordered phases fall under the purview of the celebrated landau paradigm of symmetry-broken phases, they have been termed as so-called hidden orders: mysterious phases of matter whose orderings are invisible to conventional local probes (such as neutron scattering or magnetic reso- nance), but are remarkably still known to exist as their onset triggers non-analytic signatures in thermodynamic measure- ments . studying the mysterious ordering patterns of higher order multipoles is also often rendered challenging since they typically coexist with conventional dipolar moments. ex- amples of such symmetry breaking which are of great interest include spin-nematic order in spin s quantum mag- nets, quadrupolar charge order in transition metal oxides, and higher multipolar order in f-electron heavy fermion materials such as urusi and ube . the quest to probe such orders has led to novel experimental techniques, e.g., elastoresistivity to elucidate the quadrupolar or- der associated with orbital nematicity in the iron pnictides. a broad understanding of the nature of these symmetry broken phases, and means to denitively demonstrate their existence, has proven to be a challenging, yet stimulating, endeavor for both theory and experiment. more recently, experiments have begun to study angle- dependent magnetostriction, the change in sample length in- duced by a magnetic eld which can point along various crys- talline directions, in a wide class of materials with multipolar degrees of freedom . motivated by these experiments, in this work we theoretically discuss how magnetostriction provides a novel means to directly probe multipolar order parameters. the central observation of this paper is that an applied magnetic eld allows for a linear coupling between lattice strain elds and a uniform octupole moment which depends strongly on the applied eld direction. in the ab- sence of a dipolar moment, this enables measurements of the magnetostriction to directly reveal the hidden octupolar order parameter. we investigate such eld-scaling behaviour of the magnetostriction for various magnetic eld directions by em- ploying a symmetry-based landau theory, which allows us to highlight the universal aspects of the physics and to show that this idea is broadly applicable to a wide class of materials. our work is motivated by a recent series of beautiful ex- periments on the pr-based cage compounds belonging to the pr family which form an ideal setting to study multipolar moments and associated hidden orders . in these systems, the f electrons of pr+ ions subject to cefs host a ground non-kramers doublet with solely higher-order moments: quadrupoles and octupole . uncovering and understanding the pattern of multipolar ordering across this family of materials has remained an important open problem. the nature of the quadrupolar ordering in these cage com- pounds has been indirectly examined with a few techniques such as ultrasound experiments (indicating softening of elastic modulus at quadrupolar ordering tempera- to whom correspondence should be addressed. e-mail: ybkim@physics.utoronto.ca arxiv:v dec ture, tq), as well as nmr measurements (where the magnetic eld-induced dipole moment is strongly dependent on the underlying quadrupolar phase ). more recently, magne- tostriction and thermal expansion strain experiments have also lent themselves as possible probes to study the transi- tions and the underlying quadrupolar phase. by contrast, the octupolar ordered state has continued to remain an elusive phase of matter, with only indirect hints of its existence from nmr and sr measurements, but as yet no direct probe to reveal its existence . in this study, motivated by showing how magnetostriction behaves in the presence of quadrupolar and octupolar orders, we focus on a landau theory which permits both antiferro- quadrupolar ordering and ferro-octupolar ordering . we study the scaling behaviour of the relative length change of the system with respect to an applied magnetic eld strength along dierent eld directions. denoting the quadrupolar and octupolar transition temperatures as tq and to respectively, we consider three regimes: the paramagnetic phase above both transition temperatures (t > tq, to), intermediate temperatures where the system exhibits pure quadrupolar order, and below both ordering temperatures where the system features coexisting quadrupolar and octupolar orders. our studies predict a linear-in-h scaling behaviour for length changes for a magnetic eld applied along the direction for t < to. the coecient of the linear-in-h term, i.e. the magnetostriction coecient, is directly proportional to the ordered ferrooctupolar moment, thus providing a clear and distinct means to directly probe this order parameter. a quick way to see this result is to note that the elastic energy of a cubic crystal is given by flattice = c   xx + yy + zz  + c   xy + yz + xz  + c , where ij and cij refer to components of the strain tensor and elastic modulus tensor, respectively. knowing ij de- termines the fractional length change along the -axis via = p ij ij i j. as discussed below, an applied mag- netic eld enables a linear coupling between the strain eld and the time-reversal-odd ferrooctupolar moment, m, via a term in the free energy f = gom, with a coupling constant go. minimizing flattice +f with re- spect to the strain, we nd xy mhz, and cyclically for yz, xz, while diagonal components of the strain tensor vanish. for a eld, where hi = h/ , this leads to = / and so mh. this direct relation between the linear-in-h mag- netostriction coecient and the ferrooctupolar order param- eter for a magnetic eld along the direction is one of the central results of our paper. furthermore, we predict a characteristic hysteresis in the octupolar moment and the associated parallel length change as a function of magnetic eld, arising from the symmetry-allowed cubic-in-h coupling of the magnetic eld to the octupolar moment. very recent (un- published) experiments on prval indeed appear to nd a hysteretic linear-in-eld magnetostriction, for a magnetic eld, below a transition at t k. our theoretical results for magnetostriction in the presence of octupolar order thus lend strong support to the idea that these seminal experiments herald the rst and unambiguous discovery of octupolar order. table provides a complete summary of the scaling be- haviour of a variety of length change directions under dierent magnetic eld directions, including the eect of octupolar as well as quadrupolar order parameters. our predictions are expected to aid the investigation and identication of multipo- lar moments, as well as provide key signatures that indicate the presence of specic multipolar ordering. in particular, since we show that magnetostriction provides a direct probe of the octupolar order parameter, future experimental studies of this observable may shed light on the thermal and quantum critical behaviour associated with octupolar ordering in these compounds and a wide range of other materials.","The text discusses

"we present in this section, for the sake of self-containedness and to specify our notation, the landau theory of multipolar order rst introduced in ref. . the f electrons of pr+ ions in the family of rare-earth metallic compounds pr reside on a diamond lattice of cubic space group fd m. surrounding each pr+ ion is a frank-kasper cage . the crystalline electric eld of this fk cage, with td point group symmetry, splits the j = multiplet of the f electrons. the ground states are experimentally found to form a non-kramers doublet written in |jzbasis as = r | r |+ r |, = |+ | these non-kramers doublets transform as basis states of the g irrep. of td; here the subscript g and u denote even and odd under time-reversal, respectively. more- over, this doublet is energetically well separated from the excited states, and so for energies much lower than this gap ), the g doublets form an ideal basis to describe the low energy degrees of freedom. the g doublets can give rise to time-reversal even quadrupolar moments o = (j x j y) and o = (j z j x j y) which transform as g, as well as a time-reversal odd octupolar moment txyz = jxjyjz which transforms as u . this can be seen from the group theory decomposition, g g = g u g constructing a pseudospin basis from the g doublets as |= [| + i | ], |= [i | + | ] allows the multipolar moments to be neatly denoted by an eective pseudospin-/ operator = x = o, y = o, z = txyz. the perpendicular component of the pseudospin vector denotes the quadrupole moments, while z denotes | patri et al. the octupolar moment. we also dene the raising/lowering pseudospin operators = x i y. the ordering of these multipolar degrees of freedom acts as a mean eld on the pseudospins, and breaks the degener- acy of the non-kramers doublet. in order to describe these pseudospin-symmetry broken phases, we resort to a landau theory approach, focussing on the following order parameters, + a + + b , + a + b , m z a+ z b, m z a z b, here, angular brackets denote thermal averages, while the a, b subscripts denote the two sublattices of the diamond lattice. the complex scalars and describe ferroquadrupolar and anti-ferroquadrupolar orders respectively, while the real scalars m and m denote the ferrooctupolar and anti-ferrooctupolar order parameters. the local td symmetry instilled by the fk cage provides a constraint on the possible terms permitted in the landau theory. the generating elements of td are sz (improper rotation of / about the z-axis) and c (rotation of / about the body diagonal axis). in addition to these point group symmetries, we also require that the terms in the landau theory be invariant under spatial inversion about the diamond bond centre i , as well as time-reversal . the behaviour of the multipolar moments under these symmetry constraints is detailed in table s in si a. in this work, we focus on a system where the primary order parameters are afq and fo. as discussed in previous work , the landau theory of a system with afq order necessarily admits a parasitic secondary order parameter fq. such mixing does not occur for the octupolar order parameter; motivated by explaining experiments on prval , we choose to work with only fo order and ignore the afo order parameter. we thus construct our landau theory using the order parameters , , and m.","The Landau theory of multipolar order is applied to the f electrons of Pr+ ions in rare-earth metallic compounds, residing on a diamond lattice with a td point group symmetry. The system's ground states form non-Kramers doublets, with energetically well-separated g doublets serving as an ideal basis for describing low-energy degrees of freedom. Time-reversal even quadrupolar moments and a time-reversal odd octupolar moment are derived from the g doublets. The system's multipolar degrees of freedom are represented by an effective pseudospin operator. Through a mean-field approach, the system's pseudospin symmetry broken phases are described using various order parameters, including ferroquadrupolar and anti-ferroquadrupolar orders, as well as ferrooctupolar and anti-ferrooctupolar order parameters. The Landau theory terms are constrained by the point group symmetries and must be invariant under spatial inversion and time-reversal. The system studied focuses on primary order parameters of antiferroquadrupolar and ferrooctupolar orders, with a landau theory constructed using the order parameters , , and m."
"equipped with the symmetry knowledge from table s we can now write down the landau free energy for this particular multipolar ordered system as fq,o[, , m] = f + fm + f + f ,,m . here, the free energies f , fm, and f denote the independent free energies of the afq, fo, and fq orders. setting = ||ei and = ||ei, we get f = t | | + u | |  +  l + w cos( ) | |, fm = htm m + ummi , f = ht || + u||i + v sin||, the rst two terms in eqs. , in square brackets, are the usual mass and quartic interaction terms for afq, fo and fq order parameters. we will choose t = /tq, and tm = o )/t o with t o < tq, where t denotes the temperature. focussing on the mass term alone, decreasing t to tq t order parameter | | m || fig. phase diagram at zero magnetic eld . the temperature regimes studied in sec. are denoted by dashed lines at: t < tq, to, to < t < tq, and t > tq, to. the order parameters for afq, fo, and fq are denoted by | |, m, and ||, respectively. here the critical temperatures are tq and to [shifted from the bare t o due to the couplings u m and um discussed in the main text]. will thus lead to an anti-ferroquadrupolar order for t < tq, and a lower temperature transition into a state with coexisting ferro-octupolar order when t < t o . these transition temperatures will be aected by the interplay of the two order parameters; in particular, the true octupolar transition to will be renormalized from its bare value t o due to the onset of quadrupolar order (besides uctuation eects which we do not consider here). a measure of how close the two transition temperatures are to each other is provided by the ratio /. finally, since fq is not considered to be a primary order parameter, we choose a large positive mass term, t. the remaining non-trivial terms in eqns. and are the unusual sixth order and cubic clock terms, with respective coecients w and v, which x the phases of the afq and fq order parameters. we set l > |w | to ensure that the free energy is bounded from below. the couplings between the dierent multipolar order pa- rameters are encapsulated in f ,,m, namely between afq and fq moments , and between the quadrupolar and the octupolar moments (um, u ,m) f ,,m = g||| | sin( + ) + g| ||| + um||m + u m| |m, where the term g is a symmetry-allowed cubic term. we present in fig. the zero magnetic eld phase diagram de- picting both quadrupolar and octupolar transitions; with two primary order parameters afq (and its accompanying para- sitic fq moment) and fo ordering at critical temperatures of tq and to, respectively. the octupolar transition tem- perature is shifted to to, from its bare critical temperature t o , due to the coupling of fo to afq and fq via u m and um, respectively. the kink in the afq at the octupolar ordering temperature reects the non-analytic behaviour of the octupolar moment at its critical temperature. the dotted vertical lines denote specic temperature regions studied in sec. b. coupling of magnetic eld to multipolar moments. in or- der to study magnetostriction, it is important to understand how the magnetic eld couples to the multipole moments. due patri et al. | to the lack of magnetic dipole moment supported by the g doublet, the magnetic eld does not couple linearly to the states. one can derive the low energy magnetic eld hamilto- nian by performing second-order perturbation theory in h j, where the low energy subspace is spanned by the g doublet, and the high energy subspace is spanned by the excited triplets , this leads to he=  (h x h y) x + (h z h) y  = h + + h h + h. in the above eq. , h = with | h| = h, and + , where , are the gaps between the low energy doublets and the corresponding triplet states at zero magnetic eld. the eective coupling to the ferroquadrupolar order is via h (h x h y)+i (h z h). based on the form of the coupling in eq. , we infer that h transforms identically to under the relevant symmetries. going to third-order in perturbation theory leads to a further o coupling of the magnetic eld to octupole moment of the form hxhyhz z. thus, the symmetry allowed eective magnetic eld cou- pling to the quadrupolar moments is fmag[, ] = rh sin(h + )| ||h| + rh cos|||h| +   sh| | + sh|| h, where |h| = p (h x h y) + (h z h), and tan = h zh (h xh y). the rst line in eq. is the sym- metry allowed coupling to the afq . the third line involves couplings permitted due to pure symmetry reasons that renormalize the mass terms of the afq and fq. physi- cally they arise from conduction electron mediated magnetic couplings ; similar coupling to the octupolar moment is also permitted , which is formally introduced in sec. via the mag- netic eld assisted coupling of the octupolar moment to the lattice strain. in the subsequent sections, we discuss magnetic elds applied along the , and directions. for clarity, we present the value for |h| and h for the magnetic eld directions discussed in subsequent sections, in table magnetic field, h = h n |h| h n = h / n = h / n = table effective magnetic eld strengths |h|, and associated com- plex angle h. for the n = , the magnetic eld does not directly couple to the quadrupolar moments, but can do so via sh and sh, as described in the main text. cubic crystal normal modes, and relative length change expression in this section, we introduce the expression of the free energy of a deformed face-centred cubic lattice, as well as its associated normal modes. we also formulate the relative length change expression in terms of the elastic strain components. a. elastic energy of a cubic crystal. in the spirit of landau and lifshitz, the general form of the free energy of a cubic crystal is constrained by the octahedral symmetry, oh, to be flattice = c   xx + yy + zz  + c   xy + yz + xz  + c , where the crystals deformation is described by the components of the strain tensor ik, and cij is the elastic modulus tensor describing the stiness of the crystal. note that we use the common abbreviation of the elastic modulus tensors indices i.e. cxxxx c, cxxyy c, cxyxy c this expression can be more elegantly written in terms of the normal modes of the cubic lattice, namely, flattice = cb   b  + c c   +  + c   xy + yz + xz  , where cb is the bulk modulus, b xx + yy + zz is the volume expansion of the crystal, / and are lattice strains that transform as the g irrep. of the oh group, and the o-diagonal strain components transform as the g irrep. of oh group; here the subscript g indicates even under time-reversal and spatial inversion . we henceforth use eq. for the cubic crystals elastic energy. b. general expression for relative length change. the rela- tive length change, l/l, of the crystal can be shown to be related to the components of the strain tensor, as described in more detail in si b. the general expression of the length change along a direction is  l l  = x i,j= ij i j , where ij  ui xj + uj xi  is the familiar strain tensor, and i is the ith component of unit vector . for ease of understanding the strain tensor, we use the convention that = xx, = xy etc. we apply eq. to particular length change directions in sec. symmetry allowed coupling of multipolar moments and cubic crystal normal modes we now turn our attention to the problem of coupling the lattice normal modes of the cubic crystal to the multipolar moments. we recall that the cubic crystal structure supports macroscopic normal modes that transform as irreps. of oh, while the landau free energy of the multipolar moments is constructed subject to symmetries of the local td environment. the symmetry constraints on f ensure that in principle only select normal modes of the crystal that transform as the irreps. of td are permitted to couple to the multipolar moments. in the present case, all the cubic normal modes presented in eq. also transform as irreps. under td (as can be explicitly | patri et al. veried), and so all of the aforementioned strain modes can participate in the coupling. in the next two subsections, we consider the direct coupling of quadrupolar moments to the cubic normal modes, and then tackle the magnetic eld assisted octupolar coupling to the lattice normal modes. a. coupling of quadrupolar moment to lattice strain. cou- pling between the quadrupolar moments and the lattice normal modes appears as a natural choice, as the quadrupolar mo- ments and the lattice strains are both even under time-reversal. moreover, both the normal modes {, } and the quadrupo- lar moments {o, o} transform as g irreps. of td (the aforementioned lattice normal modes also transform as g in oh, as td is a subgroup of oh). this similarity in how they transform under td allows a linear coupling between the afore- said lattice normal modes and quadrupolar moments. thus, the landau free energy of the multipolar moments shown in eqs. , gets augmented by the following lattice elastic energy and coupling terms to quadrupolar moments, fstrain,q[ , , ,] = c c   +  gq [ x a+ x b] gq [ y a+ y b] , where gq is the coecient of coupling between the quadrupolar moments and lattice strain tensors. note that we include the coupling of the lattice strain to the quadrupole moment on each sublattice. using the denition of the order parameter dened in eq. , and minimizing with respect to the lattice degrees of freedom ( fstrain,q etc.) yields the total strain for each normal mode = gq || cos , = gq || sin . substituting the expression for the minimized lattice strains from eqs. back into eq. , yields fstrain,q[ , ] = g q || . thus, the coupling of the lattice degrees of freedom to the quadrupolar moments results in renormalizing the mass term of . b. coupling of octupolar moment to lattice strain. a direct linear coupling between the octupolar moment txyz and the lattice normal modes is not permitted, as the octupolar mo- ment is odd under time-reversal. however, this potential di- culty can be alleviated by the introduction of the time-reversal odd magnetic eld h which assists in the coupling between the lattice degrees of freedom and octupolar moment. thus, the landau free energy of the multipolar moments shown in eqs. , gets augmented by the following lattice elastic energy and the coupling terms to the octupolar moments, fstrain,o = c   xy + yz + xz  gom , where we use the denition of m from eq. , and go is the coecient of coupling between the octupolar moment and lattice strain. we also include another symmetry allowed direct coupling between the magnetic eld and the same lattice normal modes (with proportionality constant , equivalent on both sublattices). physically, this kind of term could arise from the independent coupling of the magnetic eld and lattice strain to the conduction electrons (and after integrating out the conduction electrons); we discuss this matter briey in sec. minimizing with respect to the lattice degrees of freedom yields the following expressions for the lattice strains xy = gohz c  m + hxhy c , xz = gohy c  m + hxhz c , yz = gohx c  m + hyhz c . substituting the expression for the minimized lattice strains from eqs. into eq. , yields fstrain,o = g o c  h x + h y + h z  m go c hxhyhz  m + o . thus, the coupling of the lattice degrees of freedom to the octupolar moment results in renormalizing the mass term of the octupolar moment quadratically in h; it also introduces an o coupling term between the octupolar moment and the magnetic eld, which renormalizes the coecient of the already present hxhyhzm from third-order in perturbation theory in h j. relative length change under magnetic field along different directions in this section, we examine the relative length change, l/l, for magnetic elds applied along , , directions and examine the scaling in magnetic eld strength, h. for the sake of clarity, we write down the complete landau theory, including the magnetic eld couplings, and after having inte- grated out the lattice degrees of freedom (as discussed in the previous section, resulting in renormalizing the mass terms of the order parameters) f[, , m] = fq,o[, , m] + fmag[, ] + fstrain,q[ , ] + fstrain,o , where fq,o[, , m] is dened in eq. , fmag[, ] is dened in eq. , and the terms from the strain couplings fstrain,q[ , ] and fstrain,o are dened in eqs. and , respectively. we present in si c, the values of the landau parameters chosen for the study conducted in this and the subsequent sections. for each magnetic eld direction, we examine three temperature regimes, namely: above all critical temperatures, between the quadrupolar and octupolar critical temperatures, and below both critical temperatures. patri et al. | the scaling relations can be inferred by substituting the expressions for the strain in eqs. and into eq. to yield the following expressions in eqs.  l l  = b + = b +  gq sin cos  || ,  l l  = b + yz = b +  gq sin cos  || gom c hx hyhz c  l l  = b xy = b +  gq sin  || gom c hz hxhy c ,  l l  = b + = b + gom c + c ,  l l  = b + + = b +  gq sin  || + gom c + c . here we have used the denition of the normal modes in- troduced in eq. , and dene gq gq , wherein includes the complex-angle dependent terms in eq. ; this denition will be helpful in table below. the exact form of which complex angle term is included ( sin or sin cos ) can be inferred from context i.e. the di- rection of length change examined under particular mag- netic eld direction n. the parasitic fq moment is written as || =   + hh due to the even-in-h behaviour of the quadrupolar moment . the constant and quadratic scaling-coecients depend on the value of the landau parameters as well as the temper- ature being probed; the quantitative value is thus not of great importance for the scaling behaviour. the key point to retain is that the value of these coecients is small as compared to the conduction electron generated terms , reecting the weak, parasitic nature of the fq moment. we present in table the scaling behaviours of length change parallel and perpendicular to the three primary magnetic eld directions. the conclusions that can be drawn from eq. and table are striking. firstly, in the zero eld limit, we recall that there is a built-in three-fold degeneracy in the fq due to the v term in eq. one can consider the scenario of the zero eld-limit being achieved by applying a magnetic eld along and tuning it to zero; this causes one of the three degen- erate solutions to be chosen i.e. = at the zero-eld limit . with this particular -solution, the zero eld   l l  is larger than   l l  . secondly, the hitherto mysterious octupolar moment can now be determined (up to a proportionality con- stant) by measuring the slope of the linear-in-h behaviour of the length change both parallel and perpendicular to magnetic elds applied along the direction; the linear behaviour is also apparent for perpendicular length changes to magnetic eld applied along direction. this provides a clear signa- ture for the onset of the octupolar ordering as well as a means to study the general behaviour of the octupolar moment (up to a proportionality constant) with respect to other external variables such as temperature, t. thirdly, for magnetic elds applied along the direction the length change parallel to the magnetic eld has twice the slope of the linear-in-h term and twice the quadratic background as the length changes perpendicular to the eld. this provides a distinct verication as to the validity of the theory. in next subsections we elaborate on important details re- garding the multipolar moments and examine their scaling- dependency on the magnetic eld, to provide justication of the results presented in table prior to discussing the partic- ular magnetic eld directions, we examine the consequences of our choice of parameters, which have the following properties v < , w > , g < , rh > , rh > in minimizing the free energy in eq. , we examine each of the complex angular-dependent terms and determine the value of the corresponding angles that minimize (magnetic eld independent terms in) the landau free energy |w || | cos( ) min[ ] = = , , |v||| sin max[] = = , , |g|||| | sin( + ) max[, ] = (, ) =  ,  in the absence of external magnetic elds, there is a built-in degeneracy that allows a host of possible solutions, namely (, ) =, , , , . a. h . for this magnetic eld direction, we now exam- ine the magnetic eld dependent complex angular terms and | patri et al. table scaling relation for relative length change of system l/l along direction for magnetic eld applied along n direction. for each n, we present the length change parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to n. fq moment is expressed as || =   + hh due to the even-in-h behaviour of the quadrupolar moment . ,h are constants that arise from the parasitic fq moment and are thus diminutive, as compared to the conduction electrons term . the complex-angle dependent parts of eq. are included in the denition of the quadrupolarlattice strain coupling, gq; the exact form of the complex angle term can be inferred from consulting eq. for the appropriate n and directions. the octupolarlattice strain coupling is denoted by go. magnetic eld l/l scaling h = h n t > tq, to to < t < tq t < tq, to n = = h gq + h gq + h = h gq + h gq   go c m h + h n = =  c + gq h  h gq +  c + gq h  h gq +  c + gq h  h =   c  h   c  h   c  h =  c + gq h  h gq +  c + gq h  h gq +  c + gq h  h n = =   c  h   c  h  go c m  h +   c  h =  c + gq h  h gq +  c + gq h  h gq  go c m  h +  c + gq h  h = determine the value of the corresponding angles that minimize the landau free energy , |rh| cos|h||| min[] = = , | rh||h|| | sin( + ) min[ ] = = , thus, the choice of (, ) = ( , ) extremizes all of the above expressions simultaneously. this result is the justication of the zero-eld-limit conclusion stated above, where the h = limit is achieved by tuning down a magnetic eld applied along the direction such that the = / solution is chosen. now, the scaling behaviour of the quadrupole moment can be understood by deriving approximate analytical expressions; this is easiest to calculate for t > tq, to, and more tedious in the other two temperature regimes. the numerical solution of the order parameters in the three temperature regimes is presented in si d fig. s for t > tq, to, | | and m are zero. extremizing eq. with = m = , and reasonably assuming that parasitic is small, we arrive at ||  |rh|  h , where we have reintroduced |h| = h in the notation of table , here h = |rh|h for this magnetic eld direction. a similar approach can be adapted to determine an approximate scaling behaviour in the other two temperature regimes of to < t < tq (where ||, | | = and m = ) and t < tq, to (where all of ||, | |, m = ). doing so, we arrive at the leading-order-in-h scaling of || t <tq + hh, where ,h are a collection of constants. the constant shift result is reasonable as below tq the afq is non-vanishing even at zero magnetic eld, and thus the accompanying parasitic fq is nite for zero magnetic eld. we arm these scaling behaviours by performing a thorough numerical study of the full landau free energy in the temperature regimes of interest. as can be seen in si d fig. s, the fq moment is indeed an even function-in-h. moreover, for t < tq, the fq moment is nite even at zero magnetic eld due to the afq having spontaneously ordered. b. h . for magnetic elds along this direction, unlike the direction, there is a lack of harmony in the complex angles that minimize the landau free energy. for the afq and fq moments, the complex angles that extremize the respective magnetic eld dependent terms are | rh| sin( + )|h|| | min[ ] = = , |rh| cos( ( ))|h||| min[] = = this lack of harmony in the choice of polar angle leads to a competition between the two terms: the magnetic eld dependent terms desire = and = /; while we recall from eq. the anisotropic sextic term desires = / [amongst other angles; not the same as the ones preferred by this magnetic eld]. thus a simple analytical solution for the scaling behaviour of the relative length change is not as easy to derive . nevertheless, just as for h || , the quadrupolar order parameters are even- functions-in-h as can be seen in si d fig. s and corroborated by numerical ts of the order parameters. c. h . for magnetic elds applied along this direction, all the multipolar moments couple quadratically to the mag- netic eld. we rst discuss the magnetic eld dependency of patri et al. | the quadrupolar moments. for t > tq, both quadrupolar moments are zero [as depicted in the numerical solution fig. s in si d] due to afq not spontaneously ordering, and the lack of a linear-in-|| coupling to the magnetic eld for the fq moment. for t < tq, the afq has spontaneously ordered, and hence also permits a nite parasitic fq moment, with a weak quadratic-in-h scaling for fq; thus || to<t <tq + hh here, as seen in fig. s the quadratic-in-h scaling of the octupolar moment can be observed by performing a simple analytical approximation, where for the sake of simplicity, we assume only pure fo ordering . this simplied landau free energy is of the form, f =  tm g o c  m + umm , where we have taken hx = hy = hz = h/ extremizing this free energy, and assuming t is far enough below the octupolar critical temperature such that g oh/c |tm| is small enough to taylor-expand to yield m r |tm| um  + g oh c|tm|  . thus substituting this approximate solution into eq. yields a linear in h behaviour in the length change . in the presence of all order parameters, we obtain (from thorough numerical minimization of the full landau free energy) the same scaling relation of the octupolar moments i.e. m a+ah, where a, are nite constants. the even-in-h scaling behaviour of the multipolar moments is apparent qualitatively in si d fig. s it is important to note that this scaling behaviour was performed under the assumption that we could neglect the o coupling between the octupolar moment and the magnetic eld i.e. neglected hxhyhzm in the landau free energy. for magnetic elds along and this term is zero, and plays no role anyway, but for magnetic elds along the direction it is non-zero (albeit small relative to the hm coupling). more importantly, the cubic-in-h coupling breaks the z symmetry of the octupolar moment. this introduces a ip in the octupolar moment at h = (and at t < to where m has spontaneously ordered i.e. m = ): for h = +, the +|m| solution is chosen, and as we crossover to h = , the now physically distinct |m| solution is chosen . a similar phenomena is observed in usual ferromagnetism, below the ordering temperature. although this hm correction can be safely ignored for discussions regarding scaling behaviour at small magnetic elds, its eect becomes very important when studying hysteresis behaviour.","The text discusses the interaction of multipolar orders in a system by analyzing the Landau free energy for a particular system with multipolar order. It covers the critical temperatures and transitions between different order states, highlighting the interplay and effects of different order parameters. The coupling of multipolar moments with lattice normal modes and the effects of magnetic fields on these interactions are detailed. The text also presents the relative length changes under magnetic fields along different directions and examines the scaling behavior of the system based on the Landau theory parameters. It concludes with the implications of the chosen parameters and the explanation of the scaling behavior in different temperature regimes and magnetic field directions."

"we are motivated in this section by recent unpublished experi- ments where hysteretic behaviour is observed in the length change along the direction below the supposed-octupolar temperature. hysteresis arises from the existence of domains and the motion of domain walls in the presence of obstructing pinning sites, which have not been taken into account in the landau theory we have studied. in order to incorporate mexp h l l fig. hysteresis for h || . total octupolar order parameter versus magnetic eld strength along direction demonstrating hysteresis for t < tq, to. initial condition of mir = for h = is used to obtain this solution, and k = , = , c = . length change along direction demonstrating hysteresis, using the solution of , and taking = . such eects, we adapt the phenomenological approach due to jiles and atherton which has been used to study hysteresis loops in ferromagnetic and ferroelastic materials. this approach identies the order parameter (obtained by minimizing the landau free energy) as its ideal bulk value, where the landau theory includes a direct coupling ufmh of the ferro-octupolar moment m and the external magnetic eld. deviations from this ideal value are captured in terms of a lag , described by a phenomenological equation dmir dh = m mir k , where k characterizes the pinning strength (encoding the num- ber of pinning sites and the energy cost of overcoming a single pinning site), is a constant describing the coupling between octupolar domains, and the sign applies respectively for increasing and decreasing magnetic elds. the experimentally relevant octupole moment is then given by mexp = mir + c . where c is a constant. a heuristic derivation of these equations is given in the si e. the algorithm to determine the total macroscopic octupolar moment is straightforward. first we minimize the landau free energy to obtain the ideal octupolar moment m. next, we solve eq. for mir. finally, we obtain mexp by using eq. we now examine hysteresis behaviour occurring at a temper- ature of t < to. figure depicts the hysteresis behaviour for the total bulk octupolar moment mexp, which is reminis- cent of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. the initial condition used to solve eq. is chosen so that at h = , the ideal conguration is not being met ; this depicts | patri et al. the realistic scenario of having not all domains aligned in the same direction at h = inserting this solution for the octupolar moment into eq. , we obtain the length change along the direction, as shown in fig. for small magnetic eld strengths,   l l  presents the linear in h scaling as seen in fig.","Recent experiments have shown hysteretic behavior in the length change in the presence of octupolar ordering below a certain temperature.

"in this work, motivated by recent and ongoing experiments on pr, we have used landau theory of multi- polar orders coupled to lattice strain elds to study magne- tostriction in systems with quadrupolar and octupolar orders. our theoretical results for magnetostriction in the presence of octupolar order appear consistent with recent magnetostric- tion experiments on prval where the onset of unusual linear-in-eld and hysteretic magnetostriction is observed for elds along the direction for t < k . in addi- tion, we can qualitatively understand the quadratic-in-eld background magnetostriction observed in these experiments. in particular, we have discussed the scaling behaviour of the length change in such landau theory models for magnetic elds applied along , and directions in three temperature regimes: t > tq, to, to < t < tq, and t < tq, to. from our studies we conclude that linear-in-h scaling of the length change is observed for length changes (both parallel and perpendicular) to magnetic elds applied along the direction, and for length changes perpendicular to , below to. moreover, the coecient of the linear-in-h term is directly proportional to the octupolar moment, thus giving a distinct signature for the onset of octupolar ordering as well as a means to detect/measure the octupolar moment. for magnetic elds applied along the and directions, the length changes also acquire quadratic-in-h scaling behaviour. this scaling arises from the quadrupolar moments and/or direct coupling of the conduction electrons to the external magnetic eld and the lattice normal modes. the summary of the scaling behaviours is presented succinctly in table finally, we demonstrate a characteristic hysteresis behaviour in the octupolar order parameter and the associated length change for magnetic eld applied along . this hysteretic behaviour is identied as a consequence of the hm direct magnetic eld coupling to the octupolar moment. in terms of future work, an interesting avenue to explore is that of the coupling of the conduction electrons to the multipo- lar moments, as well as to the lattice strain and magnetic eld. in particular, the origin of the conduction electron term in eq. , introduced in our phenomenological model from symme- try arguments, is a fascinating direction to explore (as well as potential other terms arising from conduction electrons). understanding the nature and role of the conduction electrons will also help shed light on the quantum critical behaviour and superconductivity in such multipolar kondo lattice systems . acknowledgments. we thank piers coleman and premi chandra for helpful discussions on landau theory of magnetostric- tion, in particular relating to the coupling between the octupole and magnetic eld. we also thank wonjune choi and li ern chern for helpful comments regarding the manuscript. this work was sup- ported by nserc of canada, and canadian institute for advanced research. s.b.l. is supported by the kaist startup and national research foundation grant . this work was partially supported by grants-in-aids for scientic research on innovative areas from the ministry of education, culture, sports, science, and technology of japan, by crest, japan science and technology agency, and by grants-in-aid for scientic research from the japanese society for the promotion of science . fazekas p lecture notes on electron correlation and magnetism.

"the relative length change, l/l, of the crystal can be shown to be related to the components of the strain tensor. to derive such an expression we consider a pair of neighbouring points situated at x and x + x, respectively, in the undeformed crystal. the vector separating these two points is x = s , where s is the distance between a and b, and eab is the unit vector directed from a to b. under a deformation, the points a and b get respectively shifted by displacement vectors u and u( x+ x) to new locations y( x) = x+ u( x) and y( x+ x) = [ x+ x]+ u( x+ x). the relative vector connecting these neighbouring points in the deformed crystal is y = x + u, where for small enough displacements ui = k ui xk xk; i = , , is the unit vector directions, and k is being summed over. expanding the relative length change (| y| | x|) over the initial separation of the points (| x|) leads to the general expression of the length change along a direction  l l  = x i,j= ij i j , where ij  ui xj + uj xi  is the familiar strain tensor, and i is the ith component of the unit vector .","The crystal's relative length change is related to the strain tensor components by considering neighboring points and their displacement vectors.

"the values of the landau parame- ters are arbitrary to a certain extent, and depending on the choice of the parameters the subsequent scaling coecients are altered. for the studies in this work, we used the following values for the landau parameters : t c q = and t c o = , u = um = u = w = u m = um = , l = , v = , rh = rh = , sh = sh = , = , go = , gq = , = , and c = the values for the elastic modulus tensor components are chosen to be large, because as seen in eq. they are only responsible for shifting the critical temperatures of afq, fo . d. multipolar order parameters with respect to magnetic eld strength. figures s, s, s presents the solutions of the order parameters from a thorough numerical study of the complete lan- dau free energy. as can be seen, the fq moment is indeed an even function-in-h. we stress on the atypical nature of the direction, in that it introduces a degeneracy into the system. we can observe this by just focusing on the afq moments terms, where if we take = + x = cos( ) = cos , = + x = sin(/ + ) = cos , = / + y = sin( ) = cos , = / + y = cos) = cos , where x and y are the deviations from and /, respectively. these terms are invariant under x x and y y, resulting in two equivalent orientations for the quadrupolar moment. it is this sym- metry that is responsible for degeneracy and the observed multiple solutions. the multiple solutions persist for small magnetic eld strengths (where the competition with the anisotropic term is still ongoing); however, for large enough eld strengths, the magnetic eld term dominates over the anisotropic term to yield one unique solution determined by the magnetic eld term. the point at which the magnetic eld has dominated and takes over the anisotropic term is observed as a kink in the order parameters, as seen in fig. s; above this hkink the multiple solutions vanishes, and a single/unique solution emerges. note that this multiple solutions phenomena is not unique to the eld direction; it can readily be transferred over to the directions solutions by ipping the sign of the chosen parameters v, rg, g, which then gives the pure/unique solution to . nevertheless, this degeneracy does not impact the observed scaling behaviour. in temperature regimes of t < tq, there is the aforementioned kink at hkink in both the afq and fq order parameters for to < t < tq and t < tq, to, respectively, as seen in fig. s; the kink is more noticeable in the | | than || due to the small, parasitic nature of fq. it is interesting to note that this kink appears for a larger value of h for t < tq, to than in to < t < tq. this stems from the fact that for t much lower than tq, the | | and || contribution to the free energy is substantial, and thus to overcome these anisotropic terms it requires a larger magnetic eld. hence, the value of hkink grows the lower in t we go . apart from this kink, the scaling relations of the fq is as expected with a constant zero-in-h shift being present for t < tq, due to presence of spontaneously ordered afq. we also note that for large enough h, the afq is tuned to zero with the ferro-like moments surviving.","The Landau parameters influence the scaling coefficients in a study involving various values for these parameters. The elastic modulus tensor components are chosen to be large to shift critical temperatures of order parameters with respect to magnetic field strength. Multiple solutions of order parameters are observed, with a degeneracy introduced into the system due to symmetry. Small magnetic field strengths result in multiple solutions, but large enough field strengths yield a unique solution dominated by the magnetic field term. A kink in the order parameters signifies the transition point. The degeneracy does not affect scaling behavior. The scaling relations of the order parameters exhibit expected behavior with a zero-in-field shift. The presence of spontaneously ordered moments is also noted."
"we provide a more detailed derivation of the hysteresis model of octupolar moments. the derivation follows that of jiles and atherton with a few modications that we elaborate on. the basic premise is that of two equally large domains of octupolar order separated by a domain wall. this domain wall is assumed to lie directly on top of a so-called pinning site. a pinning site can be any object that obstructs the motion of domain walls under the inuence of a magnetic eld; the true nature of the pinning site is not of great importance to the derivation presented here. the domains possess an octupolar moment per unit volume, md. due to the ising-like nature of the octupolar moment, one can think of one domain being md = +md, while the other domain being m d = md. the interaction of each domains octupolar moment with the magnetic eld and the bulk octupolar moment of the system is described by ecoupling = ufmd, where uf is a coecient of coupling, and where we incorporate inter-domain coupling by a weiss-like mean eld term . fe hxhyhz + m is the eective eld. we now consider the application of a magnetic eld on the system that encourages the expansion of the +md domain i.e. it is energetically favourable to have both the domains align as +md. in the absence of the pinning site, this domain wall slides over easily thus enabling the expansion of the domain. however, the pinning site obstructs this simple motion. in the spirit of jiles and atherton, we consider the energy required to overcome the pinning site to be equal to the energy required to align the octupolar moment of md with +md i.e. ecost = c  ufmdfe (ufm dfe) = c  ufmdfe  . this is the energy required to overcome a single pinning site. we now generalize the scenario where we have a collection of such patri et al. | h +h h order parameter | | m || h +h h order parameter h +h h order parameter fig. s order parameters afq [| |], fo , fq versus magnetic eld strength h applied along direction, for t > tq, to , to < t < tq, and t < tq, to. qualitatively, the multipolar moments possess even-in-h symmetry. h +h h order parameter | | m || h +h h order parameter h +h h order parameter fig. s order parameters afq [| |], fo , fq versus magnetic eld strength h applied along direction, for t > tq, to , to < t < tq, and t < tq, to. qualitatively, the multipolar moments possess even-in-h symmetry. h +h h order parameter | | m || h +h h order parameter h +h h order parameter fig. s order parameters afq [| |], fo , fq versus magnetic eld strength h applied along direction, for t > tq, to , to < t < tq, and t < tq, to. qualitatively, the multipolar moments possess even-in-h symmetry. pinning sites over a distance dx, and the magnetic eld is applied such that the domain wall is swept over that distance dx. if there exists an average density of pinning sites, n, over this volume a dx and the average energy to overcome a site is ecost[where the averaging is performed over all the pinning sites] then the total energy dissipated through moving this domain wall through this mire of pinning sites is etotal = z x ecostnadx , where nadx is the total number of pinning sites in the volume of interest. since the change in the bulk octupolar moment (as the magnetic eld moves the domain wall past the pinning site) is dmir = ) adx = mdadx, then we can replace the | patri et al. integrand in the above equation by etotal = z mir necost md dmir = k z mir dmir , where k necost md , which we take to be a constant. although the derivation is quite involved, the nal result physical makes sense in that the total work done in moving the domain wall past the pinning sites is proportional to the change in the bulk octupolar moment . next, we consider the energy required to set up a bulk octupolar conguration, mir which is the energy required to setup the ideal bulk octupolar moment in the absence of pinning sites, m, in an eective eld, fe, plus the energy required to overcome the domain wall, z mird fe = z md fe + k z dmir = z md fe + k z dmir d fe d fe collecting the integrands, z  mir m + k dmir d fe  d fe = , where we introduce the dummy variable of integration fe. for magnetic elds being swept up from to fe, the bounds on the integrand are: r up r fe , while for sweeping down from to fe is from r down r fe . taking the derivative of the above eq. for the up sweep we get (by applying the fundamental theorem of calculus), d d fe z fe  mir m + k dmir d fe  d fe =  = mir = m k dmir dfe . similarly for the down sweeping magnetic eld, we get (by changing variables in the integrand fe fe), d d fe z fe  mir m + k dmir d fe  d fe =  = mir = m + k dmir dfe . thus, we obtain mir = m k dmir dfe , where is for increasing and decreasing magnetic elds, respectively. rearranging, we arrive at the following dierential equation dmir d f = m mir k . finally, we use dmir d f = dmir dh dh d f to obtain eq. in the main text. patri et al. |","The text elaborates on a hysteresis model of octupolar moments based on a domain wall concept.

"introduction recent years have witnessed that quantum information theoretic notions shed new light on deep conceptual puzzles in the ads/cft correspondence, and also provide useful tools to study the dynamics of strongly-coupled quantum eld theories, e.g., . one striking, yet mysterious, entry to the gravity/information dictionary is the concept of quantum circuit complexity: the size of the optimal circuit which prepares a target state from a given reference state with a set of simple gates . the concept of holographic complexity naturally emerges from considerations on the bulk causality in the ads/cft correspondence . for instance, holographic complexity is expected to be a useful diagnostic for late-time dynamics and in particular, the interior of a black hole since it continues to increase even after the boundary theory has reached thermal equilibrium. in addition, complexity is sensitive to perturbations of the system, namely the physics of scrambling, i.e., even tiny perturbations to the system have a measurable eect on the complexity . the original proposal for holographic complexity, known as the complexity=volume conjecture, asserts that cv = max =b  v gn l  , where the boundary state lives on the time slice and then v is the volume of codimension-one bulk surfaces b anchored to this boundary time slice. to produce a dimensionless quantity, the volume is divided by newtons constant gn and the ads length l. a second proposal, known as the complexity=action conjecture, relates the complexity of the boundary state to the gravitational action evaluated for a particular region of the bulk spacetime ca = iwdw . here, the subscript wdw indicates that the action is calculated on the so-called wheeler-dewitt patch, which corresponds to the causal development of any of the above bulk surfaces b anchored on . the study of holographic complexity is actively developing in two related directions. the rst is to explore the properties of the new gravitational observables which play a role in the cv and ca conjectures and the implications of these conjectures for com- plexity in the boundary theory, e.g., see . in particular, we note that a number of new proposals have been made for the holographic dual of complexity in the boundary theory. for example, one new proposal is known as the complexity= conjecture, which suggests that the bulk dual of complexity is the spacetime volume of the wdw patch . further, more recently, a relation was conjectured be- tween momentum of an infalling object in the bulk radial direction and complexity of the corresponding time-evolved operator on the boundary . a second direction of investigation has been to understand the concept of circuit complexity for quantum eld theory states, in particular for states in a strongly coupled cft, e.g., see developing a proper understanding of complexity in the boundary theory is essential to properly test the various holographic proposals and ultimately, to produce a derivation of one of these conjectures. our motivation for the present paper was to understand holographic complexity in the two-dimensional jackiw-teitelboim a more sophisticated approach to choosing the latter scale was described in . model of dilaton-gravity . recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the jt model, as it emerges in the holographic description of the sachdev-ye-kitaev model in a particular low energy limit, where the system acquires an emergent reparametrization invariance . furthermore, the jt gravity exhibits the late- time behavior of the spectral form factor which are natural from the perspective of random matrix theory, e.g., . as such, the jt model should be an ideal plat- form to study the complexity in various dynamical settings and investigate further the implications of holographic complexity. however, our initial calculation of holographic complexity in the jt model using the ca proposal produced the surprising result that the growth rate vanishes at late times see section this result, of course, in tension with our common expectations for complexity. it can be argued quite generally that at late times, the complexity should continue to grow with a rate given by dc dt s t , where the entropy s gives an account of the number of degrees of freedom while the temperature t sets the scale for the rate at which new gates are introduced. further since the jt model is supposed to capture the physics of the syk model, which exhibits maximal chaos, we would certainly expect the complexity should increase as fast as it possibly can. rather than considering the ca prescription of holographic complexity, one can also examine the cv proposal in this setting and in this case, we found the extremal volume (i.e., the length of the geodesic connecting the boundary points dening ) continues to grow at a constant rate for arbitrarily late times. this apparent failure of the ca proposal motivated us to re-examine holographic complexity for charged black holes in higher dimensions since the jt model can be de- rived from an appropriate dimensional reduction, e.g., . in particular, jt dilaton-gravity describes the near-horizon physics of certain near-extremal black holes in higher dimensions. previous studies of holographic complexity of charged black holes, e.g., , had not shown any odd behaviour for the ca proposal. however, with hindsight, we note that all of these investigations involved electrically charged black holes, whereas the usual dimensional reduction made to derive the jt model involves black holes carrying a magnetic charge, e.g., . our rst calculation in the following is to examine holographic complexity for a dyonic black hole (in four dimensions) with both electric and magnetic charges. in this case, even if the geometry is held xed, we nd that the complexity growth rate is very sensitive to the ratio between the two types of charge. in particular, if the black hole is purely magnetic, we nd that ca proposal yields a vanishing growth rate at late times, and further, that the switchback eect is absent. of course, this vanishing matches our result for the jt model, which would arise in the dimensional reduction of these magnetic black holes. however, there is a boundary term involving the maxwell eld, which one might add to the gravitational action. this term arises naturally in the context of black hole thermodynamics when dening dierent thermodynamics ensemble, i.e., a canonical ensemble with xed charge, as opposed to a grand canonical ensemble with xed chemical potential. we nd that with the ca proposal, the holo- graphic complexity is also sensitive to the introduction of this maxwell surface term. in particular, the late-time growth rate is nonvanishing for magnetic black holes with this surface term, while tuning the coecient of the surface term can yield a vanishing growth rate in the electrically charged case. given these results, we are then lead to re-examine the dimensional reduction in the presence of the maxwell surface term and the behaviour of the corresponding holographic complexity for the jt model and for a related jt-like model, derived from the reduction of electrically charged black holes. to better understand the vanishing of the complexity growth for the magnetic black holes, we might also ask whether this result is special to the einstein-maxwell theory. alternatively, the question can be phrased as which features of the correspond- ing reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes are important in controlling the behaviour of the holographic complexity for the ca proposal. as a step in this direction, we also investigate holographic complexity for charged black holes in a family of four- dimensional einstein-maxwell-dilaton theories. holographic complexity of einstein- maxwell-dilaton theories has been previously studied for several models . in these theories, the maxwell eld is coupled to a scalar eld and as a result, the charged black holes also carry scalar hair. with the dilaton excited in these solutions, the nature of the spacetime singularities and the casual structure of the corresponding black holes can be modied. hence we can investigate to what ex- tent these changes to the spacetime geometry modify the behaviour of the holographic complexity. our conclusion will be that the causal structure of the spacetime geometry is the essential feature leading to the unusual late-time growth rate with the ca proposal. the remainder of our paper is organized as follows: in section , we study the ca proposal for dyonic black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges in four bulk dimensions. we rst show how for a xed geometry, the complexity rate of change is sensitive to the ratio between electric and magnetic charges. we also show how the inclusion of the maxwell surface term to the action can also have a dramatic eect on the late-time growth rate for the ca proposal. in addition, we also briey investigate the switchback eect by injecting small shockwaves into the dyonic black hole. in section , we investigate holographic complexity for charged black holes in a family of einstein-maxwell-dilaton theories. in section , we return to holographic complexity for two-dimensional black holes. in particular, we show that the late-time growth rate vanishes for the jt model, but that this situation can be ameliorated if the maxwell surface term is included in reduction from four to two dimensions. we summarize our ndings and consider their implications in section , as well as discussing some possible future directions. we leave certain technical details to the appendices. in appendix a, we describe in more detail the calculations of the holographic complexity in the dyonic shock wave geometries. in appendix b, we comment on subtleties concerning the evaluation of the maxwell surface term when magnetic charges are present. as this project was nearing its completion, we became aware of , which has signicant overlap with the present paper. we also add that an independent approach to understanding holographic complexity for the jt model recently appeared in . reissner-nordstrom black hole in this section, we investigate applying the complexity=action conjecture to evaluate the holographic complexity of the dyonic reissner-nordstrom black hole, while focusing on the einstein-maxwell theory in four bulk dimensions, i.e., d = for the boundary theory. these results are easily extended to general dimensions, if one also couples the gravity theory to a -form potential eld (i.e., the hodge dual of the one-form maxwell potential). our main objective is to understand the eect of a new boundary term associated with the maxwell eld. as mentioned in the introduction, we will nd that although this boundary term does not modify the eld equations, it has a strong inuence on the action of the wheeler-dewitt patch. hence we must ask which choices yield a wdw action which produces the behaviours expected of holographic complexity. we divide the action for four-dimensional einstein-maxwell theory in terms of the usual einstein-hilbert and maxwell actions, as well as various possible surface terms itot = ieh + imax + isurf + ict + iq , where rst two terms are integrated over the bulk of the manifold of interest ieh = gn z m dx g  r + l  , imax = g z m dx g ff . the next term isurf contains various surface terms needed to make the variational principle well-dened for the metric, isurf = gn z b dx p |h|k + gn z dx + gn z b d d + gn z dxa , this contains the usual gibbons-hawking-york term for timelike and space- like boundary segments, the hayward terms for intersections of these seg- ments, and the surface and joint terms introduced in for null boundary segments see for a complete discussion. the null surface counterterm, ict = gn z b d d log , is not needed for the variational principle, but it was introduced in to ensure reparametrization invariance on the null boundaries. further, it was shown with a careful study of shock wave geometries in that this surface term must be included on the null boundaries of the wdw patch if the ca proposal is to reproduce the expected properties of complexity. the nal contribution in eq. is a boundary term for the maxwell eld iq = g z m d f a . while introducing this boundary term does not change the equations of motion, it does change the nature of the variational principle of the maxwell eld. that is, it changes the boundary conditions that must be imposed for consistency of the variational principle. we will also nd that it modies the wdw action, but we reserve a complete discussion of this term for section . for the calculations which are immediately following, we will drop the maxwell boundary term by setting the parameter = that is, we examine the holo- graphic complexity working with the action i = itot . with this action, we apply the ca proposal to study the holographic complexity for a spherically symmetric dyonic reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole (with d = boundary dimensions). the spacetime geometry is described by the following metric, ds = frnadt + dr frna + r with frna = r l + r + q e + q m r , where l is the ads length, and is a parameter proportional to the mass. a penrose diagram showing the causal structure is shown in gure , with an outer horizon r+ and inner cauchy horizon r = ). the mass, entropy and temperature are then given by m = gn , s = gn r + , t = frna r r=r+ . as indicated above, the black hole carries both electric and magnetic charges. the corresponding maxwell eld strength and vector potential can be written as a = g gn  qm d +  qe r+ qe r  dt  , f = g gn qe r dr dt + qm sin d d  . where qe and qm denote the electric and magnetic charges. following the conventions of , we write the tortoise coordinates for the black hole spacetime , as r rna = z r d r frna( r) , such that limrr rna = the eddington-finkelstein coordinates, v and u, for ingoing and outgoing rays , respectively, are given by v = t + r , u = t r . complexity growth next, we evaluate the growth rate of the holographic complexity for the dyonic black hole . this analysis reveals the puzzling feature that despite the fact that magnetic and electric charges are interchangeable at the level of the equations of motion, the complexity growth in the ca proposal seems to be sensitive to the nature of the charge. in the following, we provide salient points in the calculation and we refer the interested reader to for further details. following , we anchor the wdw patch symmetrically on the left and right asymptotic boundaries with tl = tr = t/ a typical wdw patch is illustrated in the penrose diagram in gure the time evolution of the wdw patch can be encoded in the time dependence of points where the null boundaries intersect in the bulk, i.e., the future boundaries meet at r = r m while the past boundaries, at r = r m , as shown in gure the position of these meeting points is determined by t r rna(r m) = , t + r rna(r m) = , figure : penrose diagram for the reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole . the nonextremal black holes have an outer event horizon at r = r+ and an inner cauchy horizon r = r. the shaded blue region corresponds to a typical wdw patch anchored to symmetric boundary time slices with tl = tr = t/ penrose-like diagram of an reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole with a shock wave inserted on the right boundary at the boundary time tr = tw see eq. . in order to not tilt the asymptotic boundary after the shock wave, we adopt the dray-thooft prescription that the null geodesics crossing the collapsing shock wave shifts. and then the rate at which these positions change is simply given by dr m dt = frna(r m) , dr m dt = frna(r m) . bulk contribution we start by evaluating the time derivative of the two bulk terms in eq. . with the reissner-nordstrom geometry and the maxwell eld , these terms yield ibulk = ieh + imax = gn z wdw dr dt r  l + (q e q m) r  , where we have used the trace of einstein equations: r = l notice that in the maxwell contribution , the electric and magnetic charges appear with opposite signs! this fact is directly related to the vanishing of the late time rate of complexity for magnetic black holes, as we will see below. following [, ], the time derivative of the bulk action reduces to the dierence of terms evaluated at the future and past meeting points, dibulk dt = gn  r l + q e q m r r m r m . joint contributions as shown in gure , the wdw patch is cut oby a uv regulator surface at some large r = rmax. however, the boundary contributions coming from this time-like surface segment and the corresponding joints yield a xed constant, i.e., they do not contribute to the time derivative of the action. further, with anely-parametrized null normals , the null surface term in eq. vanishes. this leaves only the joint terms at the meeting points, r = r m and r m. the nal result for these joint contributions is given by ijoint = gn  (r m) log |frna(r m)|  + (r m) log |frna(r m)|  , where is the normalization constant appearing in the null normals, i.e., k t|r= . in a moment, the addition of the counterterm will eliminate the dependence of the action. using eq. , the time derivative of eq. becomes dijoint dt = gn  rfrna log |frna| + rrfrna r m r m . note that at late times, r, m approach the horizons and so the rst term above vanishes. hence only the second term contributes to the late-time growth rate. counterterm contribution the boundary counterterm requires evaluating the expansion scalar = log in the null boundaries of the wdw patch and the nal result is given by ict = r max gn  log  ct r max  +  (r m) gn  log  ct (r m)  +  (r m) gn  log  ct (r m)  +  . the term in the rst line comes from the uv regulator surface and again only con- tributes a xed constant. hence the time dependence comes only from the terms evaluated at the meeting points in the second line. the time derivative of eq. has a compact form, dict dt = rfrna gn log  ct r r m r m . again at late times, this contribution vanishes and so it only changes the transient behaviour in the growth rate at early times. it is useful to combine eqs. and to explicitly see that the dependence is eliminated, d dt = gn  rfrna log |frna| ct r  + rrfrna r m r m = gn  rfrna log |frna| ct r  + r l (q e + q m) r r m r m . note that in contrast to eq. , the electric and magnetic charges contribute with the same sign above. total growth rate the growth rate of the holographic complexity is then given by the sum of eqs. and , which yields dca dt = d dt = q e gnr r m r m r frna gn log |frna| ct r r m r m . at late times, the past and future meeting points meet the outer and inner horizons, respectively, and so the second term vanishes = ). this leaves the surprising result lim t dca dt = q e gn r r r+ . hence if we consider a purely magnetic black hole with qe = , the growth rate vanishes! more generally, we might introduce q t q e + q m and qe qm , which allows us to re-express eq. as lim t dca dt = + q t gn r r r+ . - - figure : the rate of change of complexity for the dyonic black hole given by eq. , with r= r+, l = r+ and ct = l. we x the parameters that determine the geometry, but vary the ratio between electric and magnetic charges. as predicted by eq. , when the charge is mostly magnetic, the growth rate of complexity approaches zero at late times. the limit qm essentially matches the top curve for = similarly the qe and the = curves are indistinguishable on this scale. now xing qt, which xes the spacetime geometry , this expression reveals a nontrivial dependence of this growth rate on , the ratio of the electric and magnetic charges. in particular, we see that as we put more of the charge qt into the magnetic monopole with , the late-time growth rate shrinks to zero. figure illustrates the full time-dependence of the growth rate, as we change the ratio of the electric and magnetic charges while keeping the spacetime geometry xed. as expected from eq. , the rate approaches zero at late times when the black hole is mostly magnetic. maxwell boundary term the discussion in the previous section raises the question of whether there is a consistent prescription for the holographic complexity that puts the electric and magnetic charges on an equal footing? in the following, we will argue that such a prescription requires that we modify the action with the addition of the maxwell boundary term in eq. iq = g z m d f a . this surface term plays a natural role in black hole thermodynamics see for a discussion in the context of the ads/cft correspondence. in particular, the euclidean version of the action i would yield the gibbs free energy, associated with the grand canonical ensemble where the temperature and chemical potential are held xed. adding the boundary term to the euclidean action produces the legendre transform to the helmholtz free energy, associated with the canonical ensemble where the temperature and total charge q are held xed. this boundary term was also shown to play a role in resolving the apparent tension between electric-magnetic duality in four dimensions and the dierent partition functions of electric and magnetic black holes see further discussion below. as we noted above, adding this surface term changes the boundary conditions in the variational principle of the maxwell eld. consider varying the maxwell action in eq. . integrating by parts produces the equations of motion in the bulk but leaves a boundary term proportional to a, imax = g z m dxg f a g z m d f a . hence, a well-posed variational principle requires a dirichlet boundary condition set- ting aa = on the boundary (where the index a indicates that only the tangential components of the potential are xed). however, the latter can be modied by in- troducing the surface term , in which case the variation produces the boundary contribution imax + iq = g z m d . of course, with = , the term proportional to a is eliminated and the required boundary condition becomes n fa = , where n is a unit vector orthogonal to the boundary m. if we choose a gauge where na = , we recognize this as the neumann boundary condition n aa = with a general value of (and the same choice of gauge), the potential would satisfy a mixed boundary condition, naa = xa b ab , where the choice of xab will depend on details of the problem of interest, e.g., . returning to the action , if we use the maxwell equations f = , then the boundary term can be converted into a bulk term via stokes theorem as iq on-shell = g z m dxg ff , which is explicitly gauge invariant. of course, the above expression takes the same form as the bulk maxwell action and so we could just as well have re-expressed there is a subtlety here for the magnetic monopole contribution in that the boundary term must be integrated over the boundary of all patches where the potential is well-dened see appendix b. the bulk action as a boundary term. in any event, combining eq. with imax yields imax + iq on-shell = g z m dxg ff . hence in evaluating the wdw action for the general action itot, i.e., including the contribution of the maxwell boundary term in eq. , the only change that has to be made to the previous calculation is to change the overall coecient of the maxwell contribution in eq. . as a result, eq. is replaced by d dt = gn  r l q e q m r r m r m . subsequently, the nal result for the late-time growth rate for the complexity be- comes lim t dca dt = q e + q m gnr r r+ = + + q t gnr r r+ . therefore if we set = , the dependence on the electric charge drops out of the numerator and the late-time growth rate is primarily sensitive to the magnetic charge. in particular then, with this choice of , the late-time growth rate drops to zero for an electrically charged black hole at late times. the above discussion shows us that the growth rate (or more generally the on-shell action) is symmetric under electric-magnetic duality, i.e., f e f = f , if at the same time we exchange the action itot itot , i.e., we modify the coecient of the maxwell boundary term as indicated above. then = / is singled out as the special choice which leaves the action unchanged in eq. . of course, looking back at eq. , we see that the combination of the bulk and boundary terms for the maxwell eld vanishes on-shell. however, the complexity is still sensitive to the electromagnetic eld through its back-reaction on the geometry. in particular, the holographic complexity only depends on the duality invariant combination q t = q e + q m, as appears in the metric . for example, eq. becomes lim t dca dt =/ = q e + q m gn r r r+ , and as desired, the electric and magnetic charges inuence the complexity growth rate on an equal footing. however, as we discuss in section , this expression produces a puzzle in the limit of zero charges. this equivalence was noted by for = of course, the reader may wonder why we should expect that that magnetic and electric black holes should compute at the same rate. first, let us recall the expectation that the late-time growth of the complexity should be given by eq. , i.e., dc/dt st, but both the entropy s and temperature t are governed by the spacetime geometry, as given in eq. . hence it is natural to think that this rate should be controlled by q t = q e + q m, the combination appearing in the metric . this conclusion can also be motivated by the shock wave geometries, which we study in the next section. in this context, both electric or magnetic black holes exhibit the same back-reaction and hence it is natural to think that the holographic complexity should respond in the same manner independent of the nature of the charge. shock wave geometries another property that holographic complexity should exhibit is the switchback eect, which is related to the complexity of precursor operators see further dis- cussion in section we will follow closely the analysis and notation of . to examine this feature, we consider a vaidya geometry where a thin shell of null uid collapses into a charged black hole. if the shell only injects a small amount of energy into the system, then the black holes event horizon shifts by a small amount, i.e., r+, r+, = + , where the subscripts and indicate before and after the shock wave, respectively. the scrambling time associated with this perturbation is then given by t scr = t log . for the chaotic dual of the black hole, the switchback eect then predicts that for any time t after the perturbation is introduced, the complexity remains essentially unchanged for t < t scr but then the dierence of complexities (for the perturbed and unperturbed states) begins to grow linearly afterwards, i.e., t > t scr. our goal here is to investigate to what extent the ca proposal reproduces this behaviour for the charged black holes discussed in the previous sections. charged shock wave geometry figure illustrates the spacetime geometry for a shock wave collapsing into a reissner-nordstrom black hole from the right boundary at t = tw. note that fol- lowing , we adopt the dray-t hooft prescription that the null geodesics shift upon crossing the collapsing shock wave. for simplicity, we assume that the thin shell is neutral, i.e., it carries energy but no charges. the corresponding metric is ds = f dv + dr dv + r with f = r l + f r + q e + q m r where fs = ) + h . denoting the usual heaviside function). before and after v = vs, the metric has precisely the form given in eq. with = and , respectively. however, we must evaluate the tortoise coordinate for each region and then following eq. , dene the time coordinate as t = v r. note that taking the limit r , we nd vs = tw on the boundary. the geometry of the wdw patch is characterized by a number of dynamical points: r m and r m, the meeting points of the future and past null boundaries, respectively; and rs and rb, the point where the null shell crosses the past right and future left boundaries, respectively. these positions are determined by the boundary times with tr + tw = r , tl tw = r r (r m) , tl tw = r , tr + tw = r (r m) r . in the following, it is sucient to restrict our attention to the case tl = tr = and to study the behaviour resulting from pushing the perturbation to earlier times t = tw. let us note that with these choices, eq. yields a simple result for the dynamical points in the limit of large tw, namely, lim twtrs = r+, lim twtr m = r, lim twtrb = r+, lim twtr m = r, . results for switchback eect following , the switchback eect is revealed in the complexity of formation comparing the holographic complexity of the above shockwave geometry with that of the static black hole with = . we begin by considering the ca proposal for the action without the maxwell boundary term , i.e., we again set = in eq. as in section . the details of our calculations are given in figure : the dierence of complexities of formation in the shock wave geometry as a function of the insertion time tw, for a light shock wave r+, = r+, and parameters l = r+,, r, = r+, and ct = l (r, is then xed by the condition that qt is the same after the shock wave). the dashed vertical line is the scrambling time for the shock wave with these geometric parameters. we investigate the eect of varying the ratio between electric and magnetic charges: after the scrambling time, the complexity essentially remains constant for the solution with mostly magnetic charges, as predicted by eq. . appendix a. in gure , we present the dierence of complexities for a light shock wave producing r+, = r+, ). notice that the complexity remains unchanged by the perturbation up until tw = t scr but afterwards, the dierence quickly makes a transition to linear growth. several curves are shown in the gure where the geometry is held xed (i.e., q t = q e + q m is xed) but the ratio = qe/qm is varied. we see that the rate of the linear growth tw t scr decreases to zero as more of the charge is put into the magnetic monopole, i.e., as hence the switchback eect vanishes for a black hole with pure magnetic charge. this result might be expected since there is a close connection between the late-time rate of growth of the complexity in the static black hole and dca/dtw, as discussed in . for heavier shock waves, e.g., , the initial regime over which the complexity is constant essentially disappears, similar to the behaviour found for neutral black holes in . comparing eq. with the result in eq. for tw > t scr, we see that dca/dtw dca/dt|t, as predicted by . the rate dca/dtw can be evaluated analytically to nd dca dtw o  + ettw  for tw < t scr , dca dtw + q t gn r r, r+, + r r, r+, ! for tw > t scr . hence as for the growth rate of the eternal black hole case in section , the complexity rate after the scrambling time depends on the ratio between electric and magnetic charges and in particular, dca/dtw vanishes as we can conrm the scaling with in eq. by simply multiplying the curves in gure by the factor / and then we see in gure that essentially they all collapse onto a single curve. the only exception is for the smallest ratio, = , which is slightly shifted to the right. this behaviour arises because for smaller , there is a greater sensitivity to the scale ct in the null counterterm . the dependence on this ambiguity in the denition of the wdw action is illustrated in gure we note, however, that this ambiguity does not eect the nal rate dca/dtw but only the transition between the two regimes in eq. . further, eq. suggests a regime of exponential growth for tw < t scr. however, this regime actually becomes smaller as the black hole becomes mostly magnetic, i.e., as becomes small, as illustrated in gure for the mostly electric black hole (with = ), we see a good agreement with an exponentially growing mode with the lyapunov exponent l = t until times of the order of the scrambling time. for the mostly magnetic black hole , the amplitude of the exponential mode is suppressed by a factor of , which shifts the corresponding curve down in the gure. in addition, we see that the exponentially growing mode is only the dominant contribution at earlier times. this reects the fact that the analysis producing the tw < t scr expression in eq. really only applies for see appendix a. when this exponential mode is suppressed by small , it must compete with other transient dynamics and therefore, its role becomes less important in this regime. in particular, if the black hole is purely magnetic , the exponentially growing mode is absent. of course, the above results are modied if we include the maxwell boundary term . in particular, eq. is replaced by dca dtw o  + + ettw  for tw < t scr , dca dtw + + q t gn r r, r+, + r r, r+, ! for tw > t scr . figure : the complexity for the shock wave geometry as a function of the insertion time tw, for a light shock wave r+, = r+, and parameters l = r+,, r, = r+, and ct = l. (further, r, is determined by xing qt to be the same before and after the shock wave.) we show the result for rescaling the curves in gure by the factor / we essentially see that the curves lie on top of each other, except the for smallest , as it is more sensitive to the transient behaviour controlled by ct. the inuence of the transient behaviour for the complexity in the shock wave geometry. we show in solid = and in dot-dashed = to contrast the eect of varying ct. for ct = l, both curves are essentially on top of each other, but for ct l, the curves with small are more sensitive to this ambiguous scale. hence if we choose = , the roles of the magnetic and electric charges are reversed. for example, with this choice, black holes with magnetic charges exhibit the desired switchback eect while those with a purely electric charge would not. further, similar to the discussion in section , if we choose = /, the dependence drops out of eq. and the behaviour only depends on q t = q e +q m. therefore, with this choice, both electric and magnetic black holes exhibit the same switchback eect. as a nal comment here, let us note that for a light shock wave, r, r, and the two contributions in eq. for the rate at large tw are essentially the same. further, this rate is essentially twice the late-time growth rate in eq. . in fact, as discussed in , there is a more general relationship that extends to heavy shocks, i.e., dca dtw = dca dtr dca dtl , because of the symmetry of the shock wave geometry under tr tr t , tl tl + t , tw tw + t . of course, there is a similar relationship between the rates in eqs. and for = - - - - - - figure : the exponential growth for the complexity with a light shock wave, such that r+, = r+,, and also with l = r+,, r, = r+,, lct = l. we show two examples, one for a black hole with mostly electric charge = and one with mostly magnetic charge = . for the larger , the dynamics is well approximated by an exponentially growing mode with lyapunov exponent l = t until times of the order of the scrambling time , as in eq. . for the smaller value of , the amplitude of this initial mode is suppressed both by the energy of the shock wave and by a factor of the exponentially growing mode only dominates at very early times because it must compete with other transient eects. in the limit that the black hole has only magnetic charges , this exponentially growing mode is absent. hence for large tw, dca/dtw is related to the late-time growth rates of the complexity on either side of the shock wave. therefore, we can anticipate that the switchback eect will be absent in exactly the same situations where the late-time growth rate vanishes, e.g., for magnetic black holes with = of course, this is precisely the behaviour found in this subsection. that is, given a large tw = t, we use eq. to shift = . then the right-hand side of eq. has a contribution corresponding to the growth rate on the right boundary at very late times and another coming from very early times on the left boundary. in fact, the latter is probing the white hole part of the penrose diagram when the complexity is actually decreasing, e.g., . however, by the time symmetry of the unperturbed penrose diagram, this early-time rate matches the late-time rate up to an overall sign, i.e., the minus sign in eq. . charged dilatonic black hole in this section, we investigate the ca proposal in a broader class of charged black holes. this investigation is motivated by the question of understanding to what extent our results in the previous section are special to the precise couplings of the einstein- maxwell theory. in particular, in many string theoretic settings, the gauge eld will also be coupled to various moduli or scalars, e.g., see . the presence of these new couplings lead to scalar hair on the charged black holes, and may change the nature of the spacetime singularities and the casual structure of the corresponding black holes. hence we would like to understand if these changes to the spacetime geometry modify the behaviour of the holographic complexity in an essential way. in the following, we consider a simple extension of the einstein-maxwell theory, where maxwell eld has an exponential coupling to an additional scalar eld, the so-called dilaton. the corresponding charged dilatonic black holes were introduced for asymptotically at geometries in and they were extended to asymptotically ads geometries in . the ads solutions were further explored in, e.g., [ ]. holographic complexity of dilatonic black holes has been previously studied for several models . our investigation of the holographic complexity for these dilatonic black holes will show that the vanishing of the late-time growth rate found in the previous section is not a generic result for charged black holes. rather, for the theories studied here, the analog of the maxwell boundary term modies the complexity growth rate but the coecient can not be chosen to reduce the rate to zero generally. however, we will see that the latter can still be accomplished in the theories where the charged black holes have the same causal structure as the reissner-nordstrom black holes. hence our conclusion is that the causal structure of the spacetime geometry is the essential feature leading to the vanishing late-time growth rate in the previous section. as commented above, we will be studying holographic complexity in a theory where gravity couples to a dilaton, as well as the maxwell eld , ibulk = gn z m dxg  r v  g z m dxgeff where the dilaton potential v given by v = l  e/ + e + e . the total action takes the form itot = ibulk + isurf + ict , where the gravitational boundary terms, isurf and ict, are the same as in eqs. and , respectively. in subsection , we will also consider the eect of adding the analog of the maxwell surface term , as well as a new boundary term for the dilaton. here, we are again focusing on the case of four bulk dimensions for simplicity. the parameter controls the strength of the coupling of the dilaton to the maxwell eld, but it also determines the shape of the potential in eq. . the latter is tuned so that = is a critical point with v = /l, where l is the curvature scale of the corresponding ads vacuum. we also note that the global shape of the potential depends on the value of , namely, for < < /, as well as the maximum at = , v has a minimum at = + log   . moreover, limv = . for / < < , v has only the global maximum at = in this case, limv = . for > , v has the maximum at = and a minimum at = + log   . asymptotically, we nd limv = . for the special values = / , and , v has only a maximum at = , but it is symmetric under . more generally, the potential is invariant with the following substitutions: and /. of course, if we set = , the dilaton decouples from the maxwell eld and the potential reduces to a simple cosmological constant, i.e., v |= = /l hence in this limit, the theory reduces to the einstein-maxwell theory from the previous section coupled to an additional massless scalar eld. for this theory , a class of static spherically-symmetric solutions describing electrically charged dilaton black holes is given by ds = f dt + dr f + u , f = g gn qe e u dr dt , e = u r , with f =  c r   b r  + + u l , u = r  b r  + , q e = c b + , where c and b are integration constants. we note that this solution interpolates between the reissner-nordstrom black hole and schwarzschild . moreover, if we set b = , the solution reduces to the schwarzschild-ads solution independently of the value of . implicitly, for the following, we will only consider nonextremal solutions, with b positive and c suciently large, e.g., c b. the causal structure for these solutions is illustrated in gure the geometry has a curvature singularity at r = b where u vanishes with any nite . in general, there are horizons determined by f = however, for /, one generally nds a single solution r+ > b and the singularity is spacelike. hence in examining the ca proposal, we will nd the future null boundaries of the wdw patch meet the singularity , as illustrated in the left panel of gure furthermore, for < < /, there is an additional inner horizon at rbetween the event horizon and the singularity at r = b, i.e., b < r< r+, as shown in the right panel of gure. following , the mass of the black hole can be shown to be m = gn  c + + b  it is useful to use f = to rewrite the parameter c in terms of the position of the event horizon of the black hole, c = r+ + r + l  b r+ / . then the temperature and entropy of the black hole can be expressed as t = f r r=r+ = r+  b r+ / + r+ b l  b r+ / , s = u gn = gn r +  b r+ / . in the latter case, the coordinate transformation r r + b yields the usual coordinate system for the schwarzschild-ads metric. of course, just as for the reissner-nordstrom-ads solution, there is a threshold beyond which the charged dilatonic solution becomes a naked singularity, e.g., if we begin with large c but then reduce its value while holding b xed. for the theories with < < /, the threshold corresponds to the point where rcoincides with r+, and hence the solution becomes an extremal black hole (matching the behaviour of the reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes). however, the situation is dierent for / where the nonextremal black holes only have a single horizon. in this case, the threshold is reached when the event horizon meets the singularity, i.e., r+ b, and hence the threshold solution contains a null singularity. figure : causal structure for the charged dilatonic black hole given by eq. . the left panel corresponds to /, for which the causal structure is similar to that of the schwarzschild-ads black hole, with a spacelike singularity at r = b. the right panel corresponds to < /, for which the causal structure is similar to that of the reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole and the timelike singularity lies behind an inner cauchy horizon . it would be interesting to study which black hole solutions are thermodynamically and dynamically stable (e.g., in analogy to refs. , however, we do not pursue this question here). complexity growth we will now study the time-dependence of the holographic complexity of the charged dilatonic black holes presented above using the ca proposal. of course, in contrast to the previous discussion of the dyonic reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes in section , we only have the solutions carrying purely electric charges here. we will follow the discussion in , which is straightforward to adapt to these solutions. further, we will only be considering the action here and defer the discussion of additional boundary terms to the next sections. since we are primarily interested in the late-time growth rate, for the theories with /, we will assume that the wdw patch has already lifted oof the past singularity in the following calculations, as illustrated in left panel of gure bulk contribution evaluating the bulk action yields ibulk = gn z wdw dtdr  r l   b r  + +  b r  + +  b r  +  + q e r  , the time derivative then becomes

wdw patch is the joint where the future null boundaries meet (with r< r m < r+). in contrast for /, the wdw patch ends on the spacelike singularity at r = b and so as usual, we introduce a regulator

subtleties in the limit produce the extra term proportional to b here when we have precisely = / joint contributions if we focus on < /, the only joints which contribute to the time dependence are

just above the spacelike singularity. while there are joints where the future null boundaries meet this surface, their size is proportional to u which vanishes in the limit hence the corresponding joint contributions vanish. therefore in this case, the contribution to the time derivative comes from the past meeting point and it is precisely given by the expression above evaluated at r = r m. counterterm contribution to evaluate the surface counterterm , we begin by choosing the ane parameter along the null boundaries as = r , which then yields = r) u . the sum of the counterterm

eqs. and are added together, the combined contribution to the time derivative is independent of . total growth rate now we combine all of the contributions in eqs. , , and and consider the late-time limit, to nd lim t dca dt = q e gn h r r+ i for < h m q e gnr+ b gn b gnl i for = h m q e gnr+ b gn i for > of course, the late-time growth rate depends on the causal structure of the black hole see gure in particular, we note that in the theories with < / for which the causal structure matches that of the reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes, the form of the late-time rate above has precisely the same form as in eq. for the latter solutions. in fact, the result in eq. reduces to precisely the growth rate of the reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes when we also note that in the limit , we recover the late-time growth rate of the schwarzschild-ads solution, i.e., dca/dt = m/. further, we observe that using , this rate will vanish as we approach extremality, i.e., as r+ rfor < /, which again parallels the behaviour of the reissner-nordstrom- ads black holes . we also note that for the / solutions, the rate vanishes in the limit r+ b, where the black holes become null singularities. as an example, we show in gure the full time evolution of complexity for = /, for which the causal structure resembles that of an schwarzschild-ads black hole . the behaviour is very similar to that of the latter neutral black holes, as shown in the detailed analysis of . up to a certain critical time, the wdw patch ends on both the past and future singularities, and during this time, the complexity remains constant. after this critical time, the past null boundaries meet at r = r m, as discussed above, and at late times, this joint approaches the event horizon. in this period of time, rate of change of the complexity exhibits a transient - - - - - figure : the time dependence of complexity for an electrically charged maxwell- dilaton black hole . we evaluate for concreteness = / , which corresponds to a black hole with a causal structure that resembles that of an schwarzschild-ads black hole. the parameters are chosen to be ct = l, l = , b = and c = . in analogy to the schwarzschild-ads black hole, the complexity does not change until a certain critical time, where the wdw patch leaves the past singularity. then, the complexity approaches the late time limit from above, with a transient dependence on ct, at times of the order of the inverse temperature. behaviour and then by a time of the order of the inverse temperature, it has overshot the late-time limit which it subsequently approaches from above. boundary terms next we examine how the growth rate of the holographic complexity for the charged dilatonic black holes is eected by the addition of two boundary terms, involving the maxwell and dilaton elds. maxwell boundary term we begin with the maxwell boundary term for the new theory , iq = g z m d f a e , where is a free parameter. following the same reasoning as in section , this boundary term changes the boundary condition imposed on the maxwell eld in the variational principle. however, we should add that implicitly we would also be assuming a dirichlet boundary condition for the dilaton, i.e., |m = further in analogy with , if the maxwell eld satises the equation of motion = , this boundary term is equivalent to iq on shell = g z m dxg e f f . hence, it is straightforward to evaluate the eect of this boundary term on the time dependence of the wdw action and one nds diq dt = q e gn  r m r m  of course, all of the contributions calculated previously are unchanged. hence adding in the above expression, the late time limits in eq. are now replaced by lim t dca dt = q e gn h r r+ i for < h m q e gnr+ gn b gnl i for = h m q e gnr+ b+c gn i for > notice that, if we x , the limits and discussed below eq. are unchanged, i.e., they yield the late-time growth rates of the schwarzschild-ads and electrically charged reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes, respectively. further, as before, the above rate will vanish as we approach extremality for < /, and as we approach the limit of a null singularity for / one interesting choice to consider for the boundary coecient is = , for which eq. becomes lim t dca dt = = for < h m b gn b gnl i for = h +  m b gn i for > that is, for < in which case the causal structure matches that of the reissner- nordstrom-ads black holes, the charged dilatonic black holes fail to com- plexify at late times. this precisely matches the behaviour found in section . on the other hand, for > in which case the causal structure is similar to the schwarzschild- ads black holes, the late-time growth rate remains nonvanishing. however, we observe that in the uncharged limit , eq. does not yield the expected growth rate of m/ see section for further discussion. dilaton boundary term next we consider the following boundary term for the dilaton i = gn z m d . as for the maxwell boundary term in the previous section), this term modies the character of the boundary condition which must be imposed on the dilaton in the variational principle. for example, while = corresponds to a dirichlet boundary condition , setting = yields a neumann boundary condition . more general choices of this parameter lead to mixed boundary conditions. further, if both and are nonvanishing, the dilaton will have a more complicated boundary condition involving terms proportional to the integrand in eq. . let us rst consider black holes for < < /, in which the causal structure resembles the reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole as shown in gure in this case, the boundary term lives only on the null boundaries of the wdw patch but in this case, the derivative appearing in eq. is actually tangent to the boundary. therefore the boundary term reduces to an integral over the joints where the null boundaries intersect, namely i = gn z dx , where each joint term carries a sign according to the conventions of . however, one nds in this case lim t di dt = . hence, adding the dilaton boundary term does not change the complexity growth rate at late times for these black holes. nevertheless, the transient behaviour of the holographic complexity at early times will be modied by this term, but we will not explore this here. next, we turn to the case /, in which the causal structure resembles the schwarzschild-ads black hole. in this case, the contribution from the null boundaries of the wdw patch still reduce to contributions on various joints, which again do not contribute to the late-time growth rate. however, there is an additional contribution coming from the regulator surface at the future singularity see gure evaluating eq. on this boundary and considering the late time limit, we nd lim t di dt = lim uf r gn r=b+ . unfortunately, for = , this expression is divergent. therefore adding the dilaton boundary term spoils the good behaviour of the regularization procedure at the singularity. therefore, we do not consider these boundary terms further here. hence, our general results for the late-time growth rate of the holographic com- plexity including the maxwell boundary term are summarized eq. for the electrically charged black holes. of course, these results match the growth rates with- out the maxwell boundary term in eq. when we set = however, when the maxwell boundary term was included, we also showed in eq. that choosing = sets the late-time growth rate to zero for the cases where the causal structure was like that of the reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes, i.e., for < / no such choice was possible when the causal structure had the form of the schwarzschild-ads black holes, i.e., for / the former behaviour was analogous to that found in the einstein-maxwell theory in section and therefore it appears that the causal structure of the black hole was one of the essential features producing the unusual behaviour found there. however, we note that our analysis here focused only on elec- trically charged black holes and we did not consider dyonic or magnetically charged black holes. unfortunately the latter solutions are not yet known for the einstein- maxwell-dilaton theory . we return to this point in section black holes in two dimensions in this section, we will focus on studying dilaton gravity models in two bulk spacetime dimensions. our main motivation is evaluating the growth of holographic complexity for the jackiw-teitelboim model , which has a simple action linear in the dynamical dilaton eld. this theory has received great deal of attention recently as the gravitational dual of the sachdev-ye-kitaev model in the low energy limit, where the system acquires an emergent reparametrization invariance . one per- spective of jt gravity is that it describes physics in the near-horizon region of near-extremal charged black holes in higher dimensions, e.g., . more specically, we focus on deriving the action for jt gravity by reducing the action to two dimensions while assuming the background is spheri- cally symmetric and magnetically charged in four dimensions, i.e., the four-dimensional gauge eld has the form with qe = in addition in this section, we will ana- lyze an analogous two-dimensional theory that can describe the near-horizon physics of four-dimensional black holes carrying a purely electric charge, i.e., eq. with qm = the two-dimensional maxwell eld is an essential ingredient for this jt-like theory and so it has a form reminiscent of the brown-teitelboim model , where the eective cosmological constant is dynamically controlled by the energy den- sity of an antisymmetric d-form eld strength in d dimensions. further, our analysis of holographic complexity in the previous sections has shown the important role of the maxwell boundary term . hence while we begin by examining the dimensional reduction without this term, i.e., by reducing i in eq. , we also consider the dimensional reduction of this boundary term and its contribution to the holographic complexity for both the jt and jt-like models. as might be expected, we will nd the holographic complexity for both models behaves in the same way as for the correspond- ing four-dimensional black holes discussed section we will discuss these theories and the holographic complexity in more detail in an upcoming work . jackiw-teitelboim model we begin with the dimensional reduction of the action but without the addition of the maxwell boundary term, i.e., setting = . we decompose the four- dimensional metric as ds = gab dxa dxb +  d + sin d . if we assume that the maxwell eld in four dimensions corresponds to a pure magnetic charge, we can use this metric ansatz to solve for f, and the result is precisely that given by eq. with qe = substituting eq. and this magnetic eld into the bulk action , we integrate out the spherical directions to produce the following two-dimensional action i d mag = gn z m dxg  r + u  + gn z m dx p || n , with the potential given by u = l + q m . the boundary term in the second line of eq. results from integrating by parts in the dimensional reduction. we emphasize that it arises from the bulk terms in the four-dimensional action and is unrelated to the surface terms or the null counterterm , whose dimensional reduction we will explicitly examine below. the action illustrates the fact that restricted to spherically symmetric solutions, our theory can be recast as a two-dimensional gravity model with a dilaton eld. however, no approximations have been made at this point, and so the full four-dimensional solution can be recovered from eq. . next, we are interested in describing the near-horizon region of the near-extremal black holes. recall that in extremal limit, the charged black holes develop an innitely long throat of a xed radius rh . that is, the near-horizon region of the extremal solutions is described by a constant dilation prole = r h. for latter purposes, we dene the extremal horizon area as r h . for the extremal solutions, we have frna = = f rna which allows us to express the extremal charge in terms of the horizon radius, q t,ext = r h  + r h l  . further, in the extremal throat, the two-dimensional geometry described by gab has a constant negative curvature, which is related to the higher dimensional parameters by = l =  r h + l  . now, in considering small deviations from the extremal throat, we expand the dilaton around the extremal value in eq. . that is, we write = , with the understanding that / in particular, applying this expansion (to linear order in ) to the action yields the jackiw-teitelboim action, i jt bulk = gn z m dxg r + gn z m dxg . the solutions derived from this action can be written as = b r rc , ds = fdt + dr f with f r l . figure : ads solution of the jt model and the wdw patch. physical boundary is depicted with a blue curve. the outer and inner horizons appear at r = rjt = . in the dilaton solution, we have introduced the cut-oradius rc. as depicted in figure , this time-like surface r = rc determines the position of the physical boundary of our system. the dynamics of the boundary position reproduces the ir physics of the syk model, as has extensively been studied in recent years . the boundary value of the dilaton is denoted b and the linear approximation remains valid as long as b/ the metric has an outer and inner horizon at rjt = . the black hole is characterized by the following parameters mjt = b gnl rc , sjt = + (rjt + = ) gn , tjt = l . the mass mjt and temperature tjt are taken as energies conjugate to the coordinate time t . of course, one can treat the jt model as an independent theory, or one can match the jt solutions with a description of the near-extremal throats of the reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes . complexity growth next, we consider the growth of holographic complexity for the jt model using the ca proposal. as depicted in figure , we consider the wdw patch anchored on the physical boundary r = rc. as in section following , we anchor this region at the boundary times tl = tr = t/ further, as illustrated in the gure, we denote the meeting points of the future and past null boundaries as r = r m and r = r m, respectively. first, we evaluate eq. on the wdw patch, which yields i jt bulk =  gn log |f| r m rc +  gn log |f| r m rc . however, recall that the reduced action included a surface term which was not incorporated in the jt action . substituting eq. in this surface term, we nd a term that is linear in and when it is evaluated on the null boundaries of the wdw patch, this surface term yields i jt totder = gn z b d k = gn r m rc + gn r m rc . here, we are assuming that the null boundaries are anely parametrized, with the null normal normalized as k = . the remaining boundary terms introduced in eqs. and have a simple dimensional reduction. of course, with ane parametrization along the null boundaries of the wdw patch, we have = and we can ignore the corresponding surface term in eq. . this leaves only the null joint terms and the null surface counterterm. dimensionally reducing these two terms and substituting eq. then yields the relevant boundary terms for the jt model, i jt joint = gn x i a i , i jt ct = gn z b d d log , where the two-dimensional scalar expansion reads d = log . combining these surface terms with eq. yields the total of the boundary contribution for the one might also wish to consider jt gravity in its own right, without any reference to higher dimensions. in this case, we would not include the total derivative contribution as part of the wdw action. however, dropping this contribution would not change the vanishing growth rate at late times, but the transient behaviour for ttjt would be slightly modied, e.g., in gure wdw patch illustrated in gure , i jt totder + i jt joint + i jt ct = gn  log  ct b|f| r c r m rc + gn  log  ct b|f| r c r m rc . adding this expression to eq. in eq. yields the holographic complexity for the ca proposal. as the higher dimensional calculations in section , the complexity growth rate is determined by the dynamics of the meeting points, r m and r m, of the future and past null boundaries of the wdw patch. in analogy to eq. , we nd dr m/dt = f(r m)/ and dr m/dt = f(r m)/ where f is dened in eq. . the growth rate of the holographic complexity is then given by dcjt a dt = b rc gn  f log  ct b|f| r c r m r m . at late times, r m and r m approach the inner and outer horizons, respectively, i.e., r m rjt = and r m rjt + = . hence the prefactor of f in eq. is vanishing in both contributions and thus we have lim t dcjt a dt = . it is interesting to recast eq. into an expression involving the boundary or physical parameters of the jt model, e.g., the mass, temperature and entropy in eq. . first, we dene dimensionless coordinates for the meeting points. x m r m = tanh  tjt t tanh  , x m r m = tanh  tjt t + tanh  . then we write the blackening factor as f = l f where f x . finally we can rewrite eq. as dcjt a dt = mjt  f log  ct l b r c | f| x m x m . - - - - - figure : complexity growth in the jt model from eq. . dierent colours correspond to dierent temperatures. we set b = and ct = l as we can see, the curves are qualitatively similar to the purely magnetic curve in , with a negative transient behaviour, and the vanishing late time rate of change. hence apart from the overall factor of the mass, the above expression is a function of the dimensionless ratios, b/ and tjt c = rc where c rc l . that is, c is the conformal breaking scale in the boundary theory. both of these ratios should be small as the near-extremal and near-horizon limit requires both b , rc note that the result also depends of the ratio ct/l, which is an ambiguity that arises in dening holographic complexity with the ca proposal see also . we show examples of the time evolution of the holographic complexity for dierent values of the temperature in gure as we already saw in eq. , the late-time limit of the complexity growth is zero. further, we note that this limit is generically approached from below, given the expression in eq. , in contrast to the expectation from higher dimensional black holes. the leading contribution at late times is given by dcjt a dt = mjt c tjt c etjt t tjt t + o  etjt t . the vanishing of the complexity growth rate at late times may seem puzzling for the jt gravity when we consider that this model is supposed to capture the low energy dynamics of the syk model, which is maximally chaotic and hence would be expected to exhibit nontrivial complexity growth for very long times. however, from the perspective of the dimensional reduction, this feature is not so surprising. the action was derived from the four-dimensional action with = , i.e., we did not include the maxwell boundary term , and with a purely magnetic solution, i.e., qe = recall that in section , we found that the late time growth rate also vanished in this case, e.g., see eq. with = the result in eq. was our main motivation to revisit the holographic complexity of charged black holes. jt-like model we now turn our attention to another possible two-dimensional theory that is derived from a purely electrically charged black hole in four dimensions. in the latter black holes, the maxwell eld strength has a single component frt and hence the di- mensionally reduced theory incorporates a maxwell potential and the corresponding eld strength is a form of maximal rank in two dimensions. in this sense, the two- dimensional theory has a form reminiscent of the brown-teitelboim model , with a dynamical cosmological constant controlled by a eld strength of maximal rank. a similar two-dimensional action was also studied in in and more re- cently in . in it was argued to describe the physics of the extended syk models with complex fermions with conserved charge studied in . when we evaluate the complexity growth for the new dimensionally reduced theory, we nd non- vanishing complexity growth at late times, as expected from the higher dimensional analysis in section . consider again the action with = , assuming the metric ansatz but a purely electric eld, i.e., f is supported on the -plane. in this case, the bulk action reduces to the following two-dimensional action i d electric = gn z m dxg  r + e u  g z m dxgf + gn z m dx p || n , with the potential e u = l . we note that it is possible to show that leads to the same equations of motion as after putting the gauge eld on-shell . however, we will show that holographic complexity derived with this action using the ca proposal yields a dierent result from the jt model studied above. we recall that the four-dimensional geometry is identical for black holes with = and = . in particular, the throat of an electrically charged extremal black hole is identical to that of a magnetic extremal black hole. therefore the corresponding two-dimensional geometry and the dilaton are identical in the present case as in the previous subsection, i.e., as described by eqs. ( ). of course, the dierence is that the electric throat is supported by a maxwell eld proportional to the two-dimensional volume form ab, i.e., ab = g gn qt,ext ab e ab . now, as in the previous subsection, we wish to construct a theory which captures small deviations from the extremal throat. hence, we expand the dilaton as in eq. with / however, in the present case, we also wish to capture small corrections to the extremal eld strength in eq. . as a consequence, we also expand the eld strength as fab = ab + fab = + [a ab] , where f captures corrections of order / relative to f when we expand the bulk action in eq. to linear order in both and f, the resulting action takes the form i jt-like bulk = i jt bulk + e g z m dxg g z m dxg h + ab fab i . where i jt bulk is precisely the action given in eq. . we will call this theory the jt-like model. as before, is simply treated as a constant parameter dening the theory, as is the constant e dened in eq. . in contrast, we treat a as a dynamical eld, however, our prescription is that the solution is always chosen to yield precisely the extremal eld strength in eq. . again, the deviations from this extremal form are captured by f. it is useful to write out the full equations of motion aa : = aab , : = r gn g   + e  , a : = a f ab + a ab , gab : = ab + gab   +  gn g  a cbc + gab  e  gn g  a cbc gab  e +  gn g  a c fbc + fa cbc gabcd fcd  of course, eq. yields the solution ab ab and again, our prescription is that we should choose the prefactor to be the extremal electric eld e, dened in eq. . when we set f to its extremal value, we note that = and eq. reduces to the expected = r that is, the two-dimensional geometry becomes locally ads with a curvature set by and hence we may write the solution as in eq. for the jt model. further, the mass, entropy and temperature all take the same form as given in eq. . now in eq. , we have dropped two terms proportional to aab since this factor already vanishes according to eq. . we can write the solution of eq. as fab =  e e  ab . the rst term represents a small shift in the background electric eld, which is allowed by the dynamical maxwell eld note that we assume e/e b/ the second term represents the leading correction to the eld strength created by the running of the dilaton. lastly, we turn to the dilaton equation of motion in eq. . we note that the second line is actually the leading contribution since it is not suppressed by a factor of or f. however, when we substitute ab = eab, this collection of terms vanishes. upon substituting this extremal eld as well as the perturbation , eq. reduces to = ab + gab   +  + gn g e e gab . one might also think of this as a shift in the extremal charge, with qt = qt,ext e/e we can absorb the last term with a simple constant shift of the dilaton, i.e., = + q where q gn g e e , then satises the dilaton equation appearing for the jt model. hence our nal dilaton solution for the jt-like model becomes = q  r rc  + b r rc . the parameters are chosen so that b again corresponds to the value of the dilaton at the boundary r = rc. however, as a result, the dilaton has a new value when evaluated at the horizon r = and so the entropy is shifted by a small amount proportional to qt . as described above the geometry is precisely the same as in the jt model and so the penrose diagram in gure still describes the solution for the jt-like model . the new features are a small shift of the dilaton proportional to qt in eq. (i.e., compared to the solution for the jt model), and the eld strengths f and f which capture the extremal maxwell eld and the leading correction to this extremal two-form. complexity growth given the close connection of eq. to the jt action , we can express the on-shell bulk action as i jt-like bulk |on-shell = i jt bulk|on-shell + e g z m dxg  + e e  , further, while this expression only refers to the bulk action, it is clear that the surface terms for the null boundaries of the wdw patch are dimensionally reduced in exactly the same way as before, i.e., the null joint terms and the null surface counterterm are given by eq. . hence we can easily extend the analysis of the holographic complexity for the jt model from the previous subsection by simply investigating the contribution of the second term in eq. to the ca proposal . in fact, we found that the late-time growth rate of the holographic complexity vanished for the jt model, and so in the jt-like model, the late-time growth rate will come entirely from the time derivative of this term, d dt  e g z m dxg  + e e  = e g  + e e + q  r q + b rc r r m r m . again at late times, we have r m and r m and therefore the complexity growth rate becomes lim t dcjt-like a dt = e g  + e e + q  . for the jt-like model. again, the nonvanishing result here may not be so surpris- ing since the corresponding black holes in four dimensions also exhibited a constant growth rate at late times. in fact, a careful translation of the parameters shows that eq. matches the higher dimensional result in eq. to leading order in the near extremal limit. the expression in eq. (divided by ) can be combined with eq. to give a full description of the growth rate for the holographic complexity in the jt-like model. some examples of the full time prole of the growth rate are illustrated in gure boundary terms? for both the jt and the jt-like model, we found that the growth of the holographic complexity matched the results found in section for the corresponding black holes in four dimensions. in section , we also found that the maxwell surface term can have a dramatic eect on the growth rate and so in the following, we investigate the dimensional reduction of this surface term and its eect on the holographic complexity in the two-dimensional gravity theories. jt-like model we start by analyzing the role of the maxwell surface term in the jt-like model. in this case, the maxwell eld is still a dynamical eld in the two-dimensional theory and so eq. reduces in a straightforward way to a boundary term for the wdw patch in two dimensions. substituting the ansatz , the two-dimensional surface term becomes i d,elec q = g z m daf abab . given the prefactor in eq. , we note that q = l + r h l + r h  e e and hence both of the corrections are the same order in the second factor of eq. . in fact for large black holes, i.e., rh/l , these two corrections will cancel one another. that is, we substitute rd = rh and and = in eq. and expand to linear order in both and qt. then the leading terms for the late-time growth in eqs. and agree, i.e., the o terms agree, the o terms agree in that they vanish, but the o terms disagree. figure : complexity growth in the

the complexity growth without the addition of the counterterm = , the dashed curves correspond to = and the dot-dashed correspond to = . as in the electrically charged black holes discussed in section , a higher value of the parameter decreases the late time growth of complexity for the jt-like model. expanding to linear order in the dilaton with eq. and in the maxwell perturbation aa in eq. , we nd i jt-like q = g z m da  abb +  ab ab + f abb  . alternatively, when the maxwell eld is on-shell, we can also use eq. to express the maxwell surface term in terms of a bulk integral. the two-dimensional version of this bulk integral becomes i d,elec q on-shell = g z m dx g f abfab , or after the usual linear expansion, we arrive at i jt-like q on-shell = g z m dx g  abab + ab fab  . next, we evaluate eq. ) on the wdw patch, with the solution given by the metric , the dilaton , the extremal eld strength and the perturbation to the maxwell eld. the time derivative then yields di jt-like q dt = e g  r  + e e + q  r rc  r m r m . without the maxwell surface term, the late-time growth rate for the jt-like model was given by eq. and so combining this result with the contribution from the maxwell surface term then yields lim t dcjt-like a dt = e g   + q  + e e  . comparing this expression to the late-time growth for four-dimensional black holes in section , we nd agreement between eqs. and to leading order in the near-extremal limit see footnote jt model as we described in section , the jt model arises from the dimensional reduction of a magnetically charged black hole and in this case, the maxwell eld is completely integrated out in the dimensional reduction. further, as we explained in appendix b, the evaluation of the maxwell surface term for the magnetically charged black holes is more subtle. the interesting contributions to the surface term actually live on the surface dividing the patches where the gauge potential is well dened, e.g., see eq. . alternatively, we can again use the bulk expression in eq. for the on-shell maxwell eld, which yields precisely the same result as shown in eq. . expressing the former in terms of the two-dimensional variables, the surface term be- comes i d,mag q = q m gn z m dxg . then substituting eq. and expand to rst order in , we see that the maxwell surface term contributes as i jt q = q t,ext gn z m dxg   , in the jt model. recall that this two-dimensional model describes gravity in the near- extremal throat with qm = qt,ext. note that since the magnetic maxwell eld and the relevant surfaces are integrated out in the dimensional reduction, there is no way to think of eqs. or as a surface term in the two-dimensional theory. rather, here we are modifying the standard ca prescription in the jt model by adding a new bulk contribution to the holographic complexity. in particular, we observe that the rst contribution in eq. is simply proportional to the spacetime volume of the wdw patch and so this contribution is reminiscent of the cv proposal where the holographic complexity is equated with the spacetime volume to the wdw patch. that is, when the maxwell surface term is included in the usual complexity=action pre- scription in four dimensions, the dimensional reduction produces a complexity=(action + spacetime volume) prescription for the jt model. evaluating the above expression on the wdw patch with the solution and considering the time derivative then yields di jt q dt = q m gn  r b r rc  r m r m . without the maxwell surface term, the late-time growth rate for the holographic com- plexity vanished, as shown in eq. . hence once we reconsider the holographic complexity with the addition of the surface term , the late-time growth rate is governed entirely by eq. which yields lim t dcjt a dt = q m gn . comparing this result to those in four dimensions, we see that this new expression matches to linear order in the rate in eq. with = , as well as rd = rh . discussion we began in section , by investigating the complexity=action proposal on the holographic complexity of charged four-dimensional black holes in the usual einstein- maxwell theory . we found that the results were very sensitive both to the type of charge and to the inclusion of the maxwell boundary term . without the latter surface term , the late-time growth rate vanished for black holes carrying purely magnetic charge, while for the electrically charged case, it is a nonvanishing constant in accord with the general expectations of eq. . the general result for dyonic black holes carrying both kinds of charge is given in eq. . in section , we also noted that the switchback eect exhibited a similar sensitivity to the type of charge. however, this picture changes dramatically when the maxwell boundary is included. for example, with = , the roles of the electric and magnetic charges described above are reversed, i.e., the late-time growth rate vanishes with electric charge and is nonvanishing with magnetic charge. the behaviour of the late-time growth for general is given in eq. . in particular, we found that the electric and magnetic charges contribute on an equal footing with the choice = / we might recall that when we are evaluating the maxwell boundary term for an on-shell gauge eld that we can express the contribution as a bulk integral of ff , i.e., with the same form as the bulk maxwell action . hence with = /, these boundary and bulk contributions precisely cancel, as is evident in eq. . a possible alternative then would be to dene complexity=. that is, we could drop both the bulk and boundary terms involving the maxwell eld for eq. to dene the gravitational action and then dene the complexity by evaluating this action on the wdw patch. of course, because the charges only enter the metric through the combination q t = q e + q m, the complexity only depends on the same combination with this denition. it might be interesting to investigate this proposal in other settings. in section , we investigated the ca proposal for charged black holes in a family of einstein-maxwell-dilaton theories . as the value of the parameter is varied, the nature of the curvature singularities and the causal structure of the black holes change, as shown in gure generally, the late-time growth rate of the holographic complexity was nonvanishing for the electrically charged black holes. however, when the maxwell boundary term was included, we showed in eq. that choosing = sets the late-time growth rate to zero for the cases where the causal structure was like that of the reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes, i.e., for < / no such choice was possible when the causal structure appeared as in the schwarzschild-ads black holes, i.e., for / the former behaviour was analogous to that found in the einstein- maxwell theory and therefore it appears that the causal structure of the black hole was one of the essential features producing the unusual behaviour found in section let us note, however, that the analysis in section did not consider dyonic or mag- netically charged black holes for the simple reason that, to the best of our knowledge, such solutions have not yet been constructed for the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory . in the einstein-maxwell theory , it is straightforward to produce magnetic solutions given the electrically charged black holes using electric-magnetic duality. this operation is not as straightforward for the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theories, in which case it is natural to replace f e f = e f , = . the action of the dual theory is then ibulk = gn z m dxg  r ( ) v ( )  g z m dxge e f e f , which matches eq. except for the appearance of v ( ). generally then, with the transformation , the electrically charged solutions of the original theory would become magnetically charged solutions of the new theory . however, as we noted above eq. , there are three special cases for which v = v and hence for which eq. leaves the theory invariant. note that all three of these special cases, i.e., = /, and , lie in the regime where the causal structure matches that of the schwarzschild-ads black hole. hence at least of these three cases, it is straightforward to verify that the late-time growth of the magnetic black holes is nonvanishing. it would, of course, be interesting to construct magnetic or dyonic black holes for the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theories more generally and to fully investigate holographic complexity in these theories. in section , we turned to holographic complexity for black hole in two dimensions. in particular, we showed that the late-time growth rate vanishes for the jt model in eq. . the latter mirrored the behaviour for the magnetic reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes in four dimensions, which play a role in constructing the jt action via dimensional reduction. this situation can be ameliorated by instead considering a dimensional reduction describing the near-horizon physics of near-extremal electric black holes . in the resulting jt-like theory , the late-time growth rate is nonvanishing, as shown in eq. . we also considered the dimensional reduction of the maxwell boundary term in both cases. again, the eect of this surface term mimicked that found in four dimensions. in particular, the late- time growth rate of the jt model is now nonvanishing, as shown in eq. . the slightly unusual feature is that as a result of including the maxwell boundary term in four dimensions, the complexity=action prescription becomes a complexity=(action + spacetime volume) prescription for the jt model, i.e., we have a mixture of the ca and cv proposals in two dimensions. we will discuss the two-dimensional results further below. maxwell boundary term, revisited in section , we found that the maxwell boundary term played an essential role in order for the ca proposal to produce the expected properties of the complexity (e.g., late-time growth and the switchback eect) for dyonic black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges. a priori, this surface term would not appear to be an essential part of the einstein-maxwell action, e.g., obviously, it does not aect the equations of motion. it should not be surprising that holographic complexity, or more specically the ca proposal, can be sensitive to surface terms since an analogous behaviour was already observed with the null counterterm in the gravitational action . in particular, in shock wave geometries, this surface term plays an essential role in ensuring that the holographic complexity exhibits both late-time growth and the switchback eect. of course, another guiding principle that suggests that this boundary term should be included is to ensure that the action is invariant under reparametrizations of the null boundaries, as emphasized in . in fact, it is this principle that xes the overall coecient with which the null counterterm is added to the action. in the present case, we have not denitely xed the coecient of the maxwell boundary term. we did nd that = / seems to be special as it allows both magnetic and electric charges to participate incomputations on an equal footing, as can be seen from eq. . hence it may be that electric-magnetic duality provides the guiding principle to x . however, it is not immediately obvious that this is the correct choice see further comments below. while maxwell boundary term does not eect the equations of motion, it does play a role in the variational principle by changing the boundary conditions imposed on the gauge eld, as described around eq. . as we noted previously, in this way, this surface term plays a role in black hole thermodynamics, i.e., it becomes an important part of the euclidean action depending on the thermodynamic ensemble of interest . hence one might ask if dierent ensembles will compute dierently, i.e., if the electric and magnetic charges would make distinct contributions in dierent ensembles. preliminary investigations with simple qubit models seem to indicate that this is indeed the case , but of course, it would be interesting to study this question further. even though the maxwell term is associated with modifying the boundary con- ditions for the eld equations, we are not suggesting that these boundary conditions should be applied on the boundary of the wdw patch. for example, irrespective of the choice of , if we are evaluating the holographic complexity with ca prescription for a boundary state dual to a solution in which various charges are circulating in the bulk spacetime, the bulk solution should not be modied and the charges would ap- pear to freely ow into or out of the wdw patch, as discussed in . on the other hand, we might wonder if quantum corrections to this saddle point evaluation of the holographic complexity would involve uctuations of elds on the wdw patch which respect the boundary conditions determined by our choice of surface terms. in passing, we note that while the holographic complexity dened by the ca pro- posal is sensitive to the presence of the maxwell boundary term, it is only the infrared properties which exhibit this sensitivity. the asymptotic contributions to action are es- implicitly, we are suggesting that the action used to evaluate the holographic complexity would be the same as that used to evaluate the euclidean action for the thermodynamic ensemble. sentially independent of the choice of the coecient . for example, for an electrically charged black hole given in eqs. and , we nd iq q e gn r+ z rmax dr frna + l q e gn r+ rmax + . hence the leading uv contribution vanishes in the limit rmax , i.e., there are no uv divergent contributions coming from the maxwell boundary term. therefore the holographic complexity has the same uv structure , independent of the choice of in the boundary term. however, to close our discussion here, we observe that the limit of zero charge is subtle. naively, from perspective of the boundary cft, nothing particularly strange should happen in the limit qt on the other hand, from the bulk perspective, there is a nontrivial and abrupt change in the causal structure of spacetime with qt if we consider this limit for the late-time growth rate , we nd lim t dca dt qt = m + + . the rst factor corresponds to the late time growth rate of a neutral black hole , and hence we only recover this expected rate when the second factor is equal to one. that is, for each choice of the coecient , there will only be one class of black holes, i.e., with = /, for which the expected rate is recovered in the zero-charge limit. we do not have any insight into this issue, but let us add that similar subtleties arise in the zero-charge limit for the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory studied in section , and also with higher curvature corrections . back to two dimensions in section , the causal structure was identied as an essential feature in determining the unusual behaviour of the holographic complexity for charged black holes. there- fore, since the ads black holes inherit a causal structure with an outer and inner horizon from the near-extremal black holes in higher dimensions , it is not surprising that the holographic complexity exhibits behaviour analogous to that found for the four-dimensional charged black holes in section for example, the vanishing of the late-time growth rate for the ca proposal found for the jt model in eq. notice that we can only produce the desired limit with a phyiscal charge ratio for either or matches with the vanishing rate found for the four-dimensional black holes carrying only magnetic charge in eq. . on the other hand, the close parallels between the two- and four-dimensional re- sults may seem unexpected when one recalls that the dimensional reduction producing the jt and jt-like models focuses on the near-horizon region of near-extremal black holes in four dimensions. that is, the cut-osurface at r = rc introduced for the two-dimensional black holes in gure is implicitly a constant radius surface deep in the interior of the corresponding four-dimensional solution. hence the wdw patches correspond to very dierent regions of the spacetime in the two dierent contexts. that is, the four-dimensional wdw patch is anchored to a cut-osurface near the asymp- totic ads boundary, while the two-dimensional wdw patch is anchored to a constant radius surface deep in the throat of the four-dimensional black hole. given these dierences, one must examine the results more closely to understand the similarities in the complexity growth rates in two and four dimensions. first, in eqs. and , we see that all of the contributions to the four-dimensional growth rate correspond to terms evaluated at the meeting junctions at r = r, m . of course, both of these junctions are in the throat and at late times, they approach the inner and outer horizons, i.e., r m rand r m r+. that is, the growth rate is determined infrared part of the four-dimensional geometry, i.e., by the near-ads throat of the near-extremal black holes. further, in these geometries with two horizons, the late-time rate is completely determined by quantities evaluated at the corresponding bifurcation surfaces. of course, we nd the same behaviour for the contributions to the growth rate in the two-dimensional geometry, e.g., see eqs. and , and this explains the close match between the results in two and four dimensions. in fact, one nds that the same late-time growth rate will be derived for wdw patches anchored to any xed r surfaces in the four-dimensional geometry . this again points to the importance of the causal structure in determining the behaviour of the holographic complexity for the ca proposals. however, we note that when the cut-oor anchor radius is varied, the details of the early-time transients are modi- ed. further, let us add that there have been signicant developments concerning the holographic interpretation of moving the ads boundary into the bulk as a t t defor- mation of the boundary theory . some recent progress in connecting these developments with holographic complexity was reported in , however, it remains we should add that the dimensional reduction does not require any modication of the time coordinate and hence another important ingredient in this match is that the rates in two and four dimensions are measured with respect to the same time coordinate . we note that refs. suggest a very dierent understanding of holographic complexity for jt gravity than developed here . in particular, this approach relies on dening a new an interesting future direction to fully develop these connections. one of our most interesting results in section was that when the maxwell surface term is included in the usual complexity=action prescription in four dimensions, the di- mensional reduction produces a complexity= prescription for the jt model. note that with the latter prescription, the purely topological sector exhibits complexity growth. of course, this is in keeping with the recent results of indicating that the entire entropy of the extremal black hole contributes to the late-time complexity growth . this also reminds one of the suggestion that the jt model should be interpreted as a low- energy sector embedded in a quantum gravity theory with a larger hilbert space . of course, the latter is a natural perspective here where the two-dimensional model and the prescription for holographic complexity were both derived with a dimensional reduction from four dimensions. other future directions we have already commented on various future directions above, but let us close with a few more observations. the preceding discussion of the jt model reminds us of the other prescriptions of holographic complexity, in particular, the cv proposal and the cv proposal. while our analysis in this paper focused almost entirely on the ca proposal , it is straightforward to examine the behaviour of these other proposals to the four-dimensional charged black holes or to the two-dimensional near-ads geometries . for the cv proposal, the techniques developed in are easily generalized to these new metrics and for the cv proposal, one need simply adapt the appropriate results for the bulk action. in either case, the late-time growth is found to be in keeping with the general expectations of eq. , i.e., dc/dt s t. of course, these approaches to describing holographic complexity are only sensitive to the spacetime geometry and they would not be sensitive to the type of thermodynamic ensemble in question. however, it would be an interesting question to examine either of these proposals had a well-motivated extension where the ensemble played a role in determining the behaviour of the holographic complexity. for instance, one might explore the role of boundary conditions in the context of the recent understanding of the holographic dual of the bulk symplectic form . cut-osurface behind the horizon using the lloyd bound . however, we must remind the reader that the conjectured relation between the ca proposal and the lloyd bound is known to fail . we observe that in this construction, the spacetime volume contribution comes with a very specic prefactor. in general, the normalization of the holographic complexity is an ambiguity for the cv prescription . the jt model provides a simple setup to study traversable wormholes and hence another interesting extension of the present work is to con- sider holographic complexity growth for traversable wormholes. in order to retrieve a quantum state which has fallen deep into the bulk, one would need to perform some operation which would prevent or reverse the natural tendency of the system to com- plexify. perhaps it would be interesting to investigate the relation between the amount of quantum information that can be transmitted through the wormhole and the corre- sponding holographic complexity. examining these ideas from the perspective of the hayden-preskill recovery protocol may also prove fruitful. acknowledgments we would like to thank shira chapman, juan hernandez, robie hennigar, shan-ming ruan, tokiro numasawa, william donnelly, zachary fisher, ronak soni and alex

switchback eect in reissner-nordstrom-ads background, as we presented in section . the shock wave geometry is represented in the penrose-like diagram in the right of gure this calculation below follows the analysis in , so we refer the reader there for more details . the complexity dependence on tw can be determined by studying the time evolution of the special positions on the boundary of the wdw patch labeled by rb, rs, r m and r m. from eq. , we nd that the time derivatives with respect to tl, tr and tw are given by rs : drs dtw = f , drs dtr = f , drs dtl = , r m : dr m dtw = f(r m)  f f  , dr m dtr = f(r m) f f , dr m dtl = f(r m) , rb : drb dtw = f , drb dtr = , drb dtl = f , r m : dr m dtw = f(r m)  f f  , dr m dtr = f(r m) , dr m dtl = f(r m) f f . we will show next how to obtain the complexity of formation as a function of how early the shock wave is inserted . we will assume a dyonic black hole in four bulk dimensions and with a spherical horizon, as in the main text. further, we only consider neutral shock waves, i.e., the black hole charges before and after the shock wave remain equal. for convenience, we rewrite the metric here as ds = fdv + drdv + r with f = r l + f r + q e + q m r , and f = ) + h . the shock wave is then inserted at vs = tw. bulk contribution the integrand of the bulk action can be written as ib = gn g f = gn  l + (q e q m) r  . the bulk action in the wheeler-dewitt patch in gure can be written as is bulk = z rmax rs dr r ib (r ) + z rs rb dr r ib + z rs r+, dr r ib(r r ) + z r+, r m dr r ib (tl + tw r + r ) + z rmax r+, dr r ib (r ) + z r+, rb dr r ib (tw + tl r ) + z rb r m dr r ib (tr + tw r + r ) . we are interested in investigating the switchback eect, so as in section , we set tl = tr = and probe the dependence on tw, which is given by dis bulk dtw = gn  r l + q e q m r  rs r m gn  r l + q e q m r  rb r m + gn  r l + q e q m r  f f rs r m + gn  r l + q e q m r  f f rb r m . for large tw, the derivative becomes dis bulk dtw tw = gn  r l + q e q m r  r+, r, gn  r l + q e q m r  r+, r, . joint and counterterm contributions we now evaluate the joint and counterterm contributions to the shock wave spacetime. in order to impose ane parametrization across the shock wave, we have the condition on the null normalization as = f f , = f f , where is xed at the boundaries with the usual prescription k t|r= , and the conditions for and are to ensure = for the null geodesic across the shock wave. because of the ane parametrization condition, the joints at rb and rs do not contribute . the joints at r m and r m read ijoint = uv terms gn  (r m) log |f(r m)| + (r m) log |f(r m)|  . the counterterms associated to each of the null boundaries of the wheeler-dewitt patch , where refers to the the past null boundary that extends to the right asymptotic ads boundary, to the future one that touches the left ads boundary, to the past one that touches the left ads boundary and nally to the future one that touches the right ads boundary. i ct = uv terms gn (r m)  log  ct r m  +  + gn  r s (r m) log f f , i ct = uv terms gn (r m)  log  ct r m  +  + gn  r b (r m) log f f , i ct = uv terms

r  r+, r, + gn  r l q e + q m r  r+, r, . combining equations eqs. and , we obtain the simple result for the time derivative of the holographic with respect to tw, at very early insertion times, dca dtw = gn q e r r, r+, + gn q e r r, r+, . hence this derivative is directly proportional to q e for large tw, such that if the black was purely magnetic, the derivative would vanish. more on the switchback eect let us evaluate more carefully the rate of complexity with respect to tw for times smaller than the scrambling time, such that tw < t scr. there is one big dierence with respect to the switchback eect for schwarzschild black holes as discussed in , because now both the past and future boundaries of the wheeler-dewitt patch end at joints, instead of at a spacelike singularity. therefore, there is always a transient term for small t tw, that depends on ct, in analogy to the time evolution of the eternal black hole . in addition, the more magnetic charge that is present , these transient eects will become important, which is the reason the curve in gure for small terminates long before the scrambling time, as these eects compete with each other. the dominant contribution, for , has a simple expression dca dtw o  + q t gn  rm rs rb  ettw  + transient . we denote rm the solution for meeting point equation in eq. with t = , such that r m = r m = rm. if we include the surface term in eq. , a similar expression holds dca dtw o  + + q t gn  rm rs rb  ettw  + transient . b bulk contribution from maxwell boundary term in section , we argued that by using stokes theorem and the equations of motion, the maxwell boundary term could be written as the bulk contribution , and this identity was later used to simplify some of our calculations of the holographic complexity. however, there is clearly a subtlety: if one were to consider the case of a purely magnetic charge, it is not hard to see that evaluating the boundary term on the boundaries of the wdw patch yields zero while the bulk integral on the right- hand side of eq. is nonvanishing see details below. we elucidate the resolution of this inconsistency in the following. consider the gauge potential for the magnetic charge by setting qe = in eq. a = gqm gn d an . of course, we recognize that this choice is not well-dened at = . as a result, this problem is inherited by the integrand appearing in the boundary term, i.e., f a = g gn q m r sin , is singular at = . hence we can not properly apply stokes theorem in the way that was implicitly done in deriving eq. . we can evade this problem by describing the gauge potential on two patches, one covering the north pole and the other covering the south pole . for example, on a hemisphere h n covering < /, we use the potential an in eq. , while on the complementary hemisphere h s which covers the south pole with / < , we dene as = g gn qm d . since the two gauge potentials and the corresponding integrands ) are well-dened on their respective patches, we can apply stokes theorem in each patch separately but now the resulting boundary terms now include an integral over the surface = / where the contributions involving an and as do not cancel. let us explicitly illustrate this point for the reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes discussed in section but in the case, where the charge is purely magnetic. given the form of the metric , the wdw patch has the form of a direct product m = n s now setting qe = in eq. , the eld strength becomes f = g qm gn sin d d and so evaluating the right-hand side of eq. yields g z m dxg f f = q m gn z n dt dr r . next we turn to the boundary term as given in eq. . certainly if we only integrate over the boundary of the wdw patch m = n s, then the result is zero since as we saw in eq. , the combination f a only has a component. however, as we discussed above, we should actually integrate over the boundaries of all of the patches where the gauge potential is well-dened, e.g., using the prescription outlined above, the boundary integral runs over = (n h n) (n h s) . hence if we integrate over this boundary, eq. yields g z d f a = g z nh n d f = q m gn z n dt dr r . where in the rst line, we have used h s = h n where the sign indicates the two boundaries have opposite orientations. hence with the prescription that the maxwell boundary term is integrated on the boundaries of all of the patches used to dene the gauge potential, we see that the bulk and boundary integrals precisely match, i.e., eqs. and yield exactly the same result. hence the lesson that we take away here is that when we introduce the boundary term to evaluate the wdw action for a magnetically charged system, we should understand that this term is not only integrated over the boundary of the wdw patch but rather it is integrated over the boundaries of all of the patches introduced to produce a properly dened gauge potential everywhere. references s. ryu and t. takayanagi,

between Anti-de Sitter space and conformal field theories (AdS/CFT). These notions provide effective tools to study the dynamics of strongly-coupled quantum field theories. One key concept arising from this study is quantum circuit complexity, which considers the minimum circuit size needed to transform an initial state to a target state. Holographic complexity emerges from AdS/CFT considerations and is linked to the bulk causality, being a useful diagnostic for late-time dynamics and the interior of black holes. Two proposals, known as the complexity=volume and complexity=action conjectures, relate holographic complexity to gravitational action evaluated within bulk spacetime regions. 

Several new directions are actively being explored, including the study of gravitational observables related to these conjectures and proposing new holographic duals of complexity. Investigations are also focusing on understanding circuit complexity for strongly coupled field theory states. The study aims to properly test various holographic proposals and possibly derive one of these conjectures. 

A specific study focuses on holographic complexity in the two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim model, a dilaton-gravity model of interest due to its emergence in holographic descriptions of certain physics models. However, surprising results were found in the calculation of holographic complexity in this model, suggesting a vanishing growth rate at late times—contrary to expectations. Further examination involves charged black holes in higher dimensions, with the introduction of a Maxwell boundary term influencing the holographic complexity. The study investigates how this term affects the growth rate of complexity in the context of charged black holes, leading to insights and implications for holographic complexity theories.

The analysis extends to charged dilatonic black holes, exploring the effects of the Maxwell boundary term and Dilaton boundary terms on holographic complexity. The results show that the causal structure of the spacetime geometry plays a crucial role in determining the late-time growth rate of complexity. Additionally, investigations into JT gravity and JT-like models reveal varying outcomes in terms of holographic complexity growth rates. These analyses provide valuable insights into the dynamics and implications of holographic complexity within different theoretical frameworks."

"the octet-baryon axial couplings are important quantities for studying hadron structure in qcd. specically, the hyperon couplings are impor- tant in the eective eld theory of octet baryons , be- cause they enter the expansions of all quantities in chiral perturbation theory. in addition, the coupling constants also appear in the calculations of hyperon nonleptonic decays and of hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon scattering matrix elements . they are also useful for calculating equations of state and other properties of nu- clear matter in neutron stars . studying these cou- plings also allows us to explore the extent of the sym- metry breaking of su avor. su symmetry has been widely studied in the hyperon hadronic ma- trix elements and this symmetry is used in many ap- plications where strange data is limited. for example, the global analysis of the polarized parton distribution function has commonly used this assumption for extracting individual quark avor pdfs ; knowing to what extent of this symmetry holds will help us quan- tify the systematic uncertainty introduced by the use of this assumption in the polarized pdf . however, ex- perimentally it is much harder to determine the hyperon couplings than those in the nucleon case, since the hyper- ons weak decay in nature quickly. lattice-qcd calculations can provide more stringent direct and reli- able calculations of these couplings. lattice qcd is an ideal theoretical tool to study the parton structure of hadrons, starting from quark and gluon degrees of freedom. progress has long been lim- ited by computational resources, but recently advances in both algorithms and a worldwide investment in pursuing exascale computing has led to exciting progress in lqcd hwlin@pa.msu.edu calculations. take the nucleon tensor charge for example. experimentally, one gets the tensor charges by taking the zeroth moment of the transversity distribution; however, the transversity distribution is poorly known and such a determination is not very accurate. on the lattice side, there are a number of calculations of gt ; some of them are done with more than one ensemble at physical pion mass with high-statistics calculations (about k measurements) and some with multiple lattice spacings and volumes to control lattice artifacts. such programs would have been impossible years ago. as a result, the lattice-qcd tensor charge calculation has the most precise determination of this quantity, which can then be used to constrain the transversity distribution and make predictions for upcoming experiments . the hyperon couplings are also not precisely known from experiments, and we hope a better determination of these couplings will lead to advancements in multiple subelds. in this work, we will be using the following denitions for the axial couplings: ga = zan|a|nlat, g = za|a|lat/, g = za|a|lat, where za is the renormalization constant for the axial current. the factor of in g comes from a clebsch- gordan coecient so that g = f in the su limit. the hyperon axial structure can be obtained through the following b|a|b= ub  ga + q gp mb  ubeiqx, where b is an octet baryon , ub is the dirac spinor, ga is the axial form factor, gp is the induced pseudoscalar form factor, and q = p p is the transfer arxiv:v dec ensemble id l s lt m val ls tsep/a nconf nmeas am {, , , , } ams {, , } am {, , } aml {} am {, , } am {, , } am {, } am {, , } table i. ensemble information and parameters used in this calculation. momentum. in the q = limit, we obtain the hyperon coupling constants that come from ga. there have been several previous lqcd calculations of the hyperon coupling constants. the rst such calcula- tion was performed in with a single lattice spacing and lightest pion mass near mev using +- avor lattices; they got g = statsys and g = statsys. a follow-up study by a japanese group used -avor lattices , producing re- sults consistent with the heavier pion masses of ref. . etmc used nf = + + lattices with lowest pion mass mev and lattice spacings, and fm; they obtained g = and g = after extrapolating to the physi- cal pion mass. in this work, we not only present the rst calculation of these quantities at physical pion mass, but also study the nite-volume eects and lattice discretiza- tion systematics, and report the rst continuum-limit re- sults for the hyperon axial couplings.","The octet-baryon axial couplings play a crucial role in studying hadron structure in QCD. In particular, hyperon couplings are important in the effective field theory of octet baryons and appear in various calculations such as hyperon nonleptonic decays, scattering matrix elements, and equations of state for nuclear matter in neutron stars. Studying these couplings helps explore the extent of SU flavor symmetry breaking. Experimental determination of hyperon couplings is challenging due to weak decay, but lattice QCD calculations can provide precise results. Recent advancements in lattice QCD, driven by improvements in algorithms and computational resources, have allowed for more accurate calculations of quantities like the nucleon tensor charge. In this work, the authors present the first calculation of hyperon axial couplings at physical pion mass, study finite-volume effects and lattice discretization systematics, and report the first continuum-limit results for these couplings."

"figure summarizes our results as functions of m . we choose to use ratios of hyperon to nucleon axial cou- plings for the following reasons: first, we avoid the need to determine the renormalization constants of the axial current, so there is no need to fold in the additional un- certainty due to nonperturbative renormalization. sec- ondly, the signal-to-noise of the ratios are signicantly improved due to the correlations in the data, since they are taken using the same qcd congurations. thirdly, we expect some of the lattice artifacts to be canceled or reduced in the ratio combinations. as shown in fig. , we do not see strong pion mass, nor signicant lattice- spacing or volume dependence in these ratios. a naive continuum extrapolation, the strategy taken by many lattice works in the past, is to assume ex- trapolation linear in m and neglect the lattice spacing a and volume dependence (using the dimensionless pa- rameter . the blue band in fig. shows such an extrapolation; we obtain g/ga = and g/ga = . next, we explore the systematics using polynomials in m up to m . for each for, we also consider volume dependence of {, eml} and lattice- spacing dependence {, a, a}. this yields possible continuum-extrapolation forms. the results of these ts are then combined using the akaike information criterion weighted by the factor wi = pi/(p j pj), where pj = exp, aic = k +, k is the number of free parameters in a t, and is the minimum g tsep= tsep= g tsep= tsep= tsep= t - / g tsep= tsep= tsep= tsep= tsep= fig. example ratio plots of cpt/cpt for g (top, for am ensemble) and g (middle and bottom gures, for am and am) from selected ensembles. the ex- tracted ground-state hyperon matrix elements from two-state t using all the tsep are marked by the black line and gray band. sum of squared t residuals. we then estimate the contri- bution of systematic uncertainty by taking the dierence total error from the statistical-only result (dierence in quadrature); this gives g/ga = statsys and g/ga = statsys. taking the experimental averaged ga from the par- ticle data guide , our nal hyperon axial cou- plings are g = statsys and g = statsys. our results are consistent with the rst hyperon axial coupling calculation , g = statsys and g = statsys (based on a single lattice spacing and much heavier pion masses), but we achieve much improvement in statistical uncertainty and control of systematics. assuming su symmetry where g = f and g = df, we obtained low-energy chiral parameters d = statsys and f = statsys, which are not consistent with the determination d = and f = using semileptonic decay data under the same assumption of su symmetry . using low-energy constants, we can determine a = f d = statsys, which gives the proton spin structure of u + d s, con- sistent with the value of commonly used in po- larized global ts as a constraint . am am am am ams am aml am m g a / gn a am am am am ams am aml am - - - - - - - m g a / gn a fig. ratios of the and axial coupling to the nucleon axial coupling as functions of pion mass squared. the blue band here shows our favored continuum extrapolation with linear dependence on m . we also investigate study the extent of su symme- try breaking by considering the quantity su = ga g + g. figure shows su/ga for all the ensembles used in this work as a function of the dimensionless quantity x = (m k m )/(m ) measured independently on each ensemble. in contrast to the earlier works , we do not see a strong dependence of su proportional to the x for pion masses between mev and the physical pion mass. this is likely due to the heavier pion masses used in the previous studies ; the dependence is more obvious when we only look at the heaviest pion masses, but it disappears for pion mass below mev. using the g and g found earlier, we obtain su/ga = +statsys. thus, we estimate a total su symmetry breaking size of about %, which is smaller than the estimate from ref. . am am am am ams am aml am x su / ga fig. the ratios of su symmetry breaking ) to nucleon axial charge as a function of x = (m k m )/(m ). there is a noticeable increase with x at heavier quark mass but it is mild when only looking at the lightest pion masses.","The section discusses the use of ratios of hyperon to nucleon axial couplings to avoid the need for determining renormalization constants. Results indicate no strong pion mass or lattice spacing dependence. The continuum extrapolation suggests hyperon axial couplings of g/ga = 1.47 and g/ga = 1.32. Systematics were explored using polynomials, leading to improvement in statistical uncertainty. Hyperon axial couplings were determined as g = 1.38±0.05 and g = 1.22±0.05, consistent with previous calculations. The study also estimates a low-energy chiral parameters and SU symmetry breaking, with a total estimated symmetry breaking size of about %.

"below we will briey describe the content of the subsequent sections, and the main results of the paper, with pointers to the specic statements where these are proved. . bostconnes systems and relative equivariant grothendieck rings. in , we show the existence of a lift of the bostconnes structure to the relative equivariant grothendieck ring k z , extending similar results previously obtained in for the equivariant grothendieck ring k z . the main result in this part of the paper is theorem , where the existence of this lift is proved. the rest of the section covers the preliminary results needed for this main result. in particular, we rst introduce the integral bostconnes algebra in , in the form in which it was introduced in . we recall in and the relative and the equivariant relative grothendieck rings, and in the associated equivariant euler characteristic map. in we recall from the geometric form of the verschiebung map that is used in the lifting of the bostconnes structure to varieties with suitable z-actions. in we introduce the bostconnes maps n and n on classes in k z and proposition shows the way they transform the varieties and the base scheme with their respective z-action. in we recall from the prime decomposition of the integral bostconnes algebra, which for a nite set of primes f separates out an f-part and an f-coprime part of the algebra. we then show in , and in particular proposition , that, given a scheme s with a good eectively nite action of z, there is an associated nite set of primes f such that the f-coprime part of the bostconnes algebra lifts to endomorphisms of k z . finally in we show how to lift the full bostconnes algebra to homomor- phisms between grothendieck rings k z ) where the scheme s and the action are also transformed by the bostconnes map. by an analysis of the structure of periodic points in lemma we show the compatibility with the equivariant euler characteristic, so we can them prove the main result in theorem , showing that the equivariant euler characteristic intertwines the bostconnes maps n and n on bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives the k z ) rings with the original n and n maps of the integral bostconnes algebra. . bostconnes systems on assembler categories and spectra. in we further lift the bostconnes structure obtained at the level of grothendieck rings k z to assembler categories underlying these grothendieck rings and to the homotopy- theoretic spectra dened by these categories. again this extends to the equivariant relative case results that were obtained in for the non-relative setting. the main result in this part of the paper is theorem , where it is shown that the maps n and n on the grothendieck rings k z ) constructed in the previous section lift to functors of the underlying assembler categories, that induce these maps on k in we recall the formalism of assembler categories of , underlying scis- sor congruence relations and grothendieck rings. in we review segals -spaces formalism and how one obtains the homotopy-theoretic spectrum associated to an assembler. in and we then lift this formalism by endowing the main rele- vant objects with an action of a nite cyclic group, with appropriate compatibility conditions. it is this further structure that provides a framework for the respective lifts of the bostconnes algebras, as in the cases discussed in and in the ones we will be discussing in the following sections. we give here a very general denition of bostconnes systems in categories, based on endofunctors of subcategories of the automorphism category. in the applications considered in this paper we will be using only the special case where the automorphisms are determined by an eectively nite action of z, but we introduce the more general framework in anticipation of other possible applications. in we construct the assembler underlying the equivariant relative grothendieck ring k z and we prove the main result in theorem on the lift of the bost connes structure to functors of these assemblers. . bostconnes systems on grothendieck rings and assemblers of toried vari- eties. in we consider the approach to f-geometry via torications of varieties over z, introduced in . the main results of this part of the paper are propo- sition and proposition where we construct assembler categories of toried varieties and we show the existence of a lift of the bostconnes algebra to these categories. in we recall the notion of toried varieties from and the dierent versions of morphisms of toried varieties from , and we construct grothendieck rings of toried varieties for each avor of morphisms in . we introduce a relative version of these grothendieck rings of toried varieties. in we describe q/z and z-actions on torications. in we construct the assembler categories underlying these relative grothendieck rings and in we prove the rst main result of this section by constructing the lift of the bostconnes structure. joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli . toried varieties, f-points, and zeta functions. this section continues the theme of toried varieties from the previous section but with main focus on some associated zeta functions. we consider two dierent kinds of zeta function: f-zeta functions that count f-points of toried varieties, in an appropriates sense that it discussed in , and dynamical zeta functions associated to endomorphisms of toried varieties that are compatible with the torication. the use of dynamical zeta functions is motivated by a proposal made in for a notion of f-structures based on dynamical systems that induce quasi-unipotent maps in homology. the two main results of this section are proposition and proposition where we show that the f-zeta function, respectively the dynamical zeta function, deter- mine exponentiable motivic measures from the grothendieck rings of toried varieties introduced in the previous section to the ring w of witt vectors. we introduce in and the counting of f-points of a toried variety and its relation to the grothendieck class. we in show in how the bialynickibirula decomposition can be used to determine torications and we give in some explicit examples of computations of grothendieck classes in simple cases that have physical signicance in the context of bps counting in string theory. in we introduce the f-zeta function and we prove proposition . in we explain how the f-zeta function can be obtained from the hasseweil zeta function. in we consider toried varieties with dynamical systems compatible with the torication and the associated lefschetz and artinmazur dynamical zeta functions. we recall the denition and main properties of these zeta functions in . and we prove in proposition in . . spectrication of witt vectors and lifts of zeta functions. in the constructions described in and of and in of the present paper we obtain lifts of the integral bostconnes algebra to various assembler categories and associated spectra, starting from a ring homomorphism from the relevant grothendieck ring to the group ring z of the integral bostconnes algebra, that is equivariant with respect to the maps n and n of and of the bostconnes algebra and the maps (also denoted by n and n) on the grothendieck ring induced by a bostconnes system on the corresponding assembler category. the motivic measure provides in this way a map that lifts the bostconnes structure. this part of the paper considers then a more general class of zeta functions associated to exponentiable motivic measures : k r with values in a com- mutative ring r, that admit a factorization into linear factors in the subring w of the witt ring w. our main results in this section are proposition , showing that these zeta func- tions lift to the level of assemblers and spectra, and proposition , which shows that the frobenius and verschiebung maps on the endomorphism category lift, through the lift of the zeta function, to a bostconnes system on the assembler category of the grothendieck ring of varieties k bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives the main step toward establishing the main results of this section is the construc- tion in and of a spectrication of the ring w this is obtained using its description in terms of the k of the endomorphism category er and of r, and the formalism of segal gamma-spaces. the spectrication we use here is not the same as the spectrication of the ring of witt vectors introduced in . the lifting of bost connes systems via motivic measures in discussed in , where proposition is proved. we also consider again in the setting on dynamical f-structures proposed in , with a pair of a variety and an endomorphism that induces a quasi- unipotent map in homology, and we associate to these data the operator-theoretic spectrum of the quasi-unipotent map, seen as an element in z. this determines a spectral map : kz z with the properties of an euler characteristic. another main result in this section is proposition , showing that this spectral euler characteristic lifts to a functor from the assembler category underlying kz to the tannakian category aut q q/z that categories the ring z, and that the resulting functor lifts the bostconnes structure on aut q q/z described in to a bostconnes structure on the assembler of kz . . bostconnes systems in categories of nori motives. when we replace the formalism of assembler categories and homotopy theoretic spectra underlying the grothendieck rings with geometric diagrams and associated tannakian categories of nori motives, with the same notion of categorical bostconnes systems introduced in denitions and , we can lift the euler characteristic type motivic measures to the level of categorications, where, as in the previous section, the categorication of the bostconnes algebra is the one introduced in , given by a tannakian category of q/z-graded vector spaces endowed with frobenius and verschiebung endofunctors. in in this paper we construct bostconnes systems in categories of nori motives. the main result of this part of the paper is theorem , which shows that there is a categorical bostconnes system on a category of equivariant nori motives, and that the ber functor to the categorication of the bostconnes algebra constructed in intertwines the respective bostconnes endofunctors. in and we review the construction of nori motives from diagrams and their representations. in we construct a category of equivariant nori motives. in we describe the endofunctors of this category that implement the bostconnes structure and we prove the main result in theorem . in we generalize this result to the relative case, using arapuras motivic sheaves version of nori motives. finally, in we consider nori diagrams associated to assemblers and we formu- late the question of their universal cohomological representations. this is a contem- porary embodiment of the primordial grothendiecks dream that motives constitute a universal cohomology theory of algebraic varieties. joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli","The paper discusses the construction of bostconnes systems and lifts of bostconnes structures to various mathematical structures such as grothendieck rings, assembler categories, and toried

"we recall here how to construct the geometric verschiebung action used in to lift the bostconnes maps to the level of grothendieck rings. this has the eect of transforming an action of z on x that factors through some z/nz into an action of z on x zn, with zn = {, . . . , n}, that factors through z/nnz. for x x, let x = aizn = n i= be the subset {x} zn. for n a primmitive n-th root of unity, we write in matrix form vn = . . . . . . . . . so that we can write vn x =  i = , . . . , n x, a) i = n bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives which satises vnn = idzn. the resulting action n of z on x zn that factors through z/nnz is specied by setting n = ) x)a.","The geometric Verschiebung action is a method used to elevate bostconnes maps to the level of Grothendieck rings.

"below we will recall the basics of a general formalism for scissors congruence relations applicable in algebraic geometric contexts dened by i. zakhare- vich in and . the abstract form of scissors congruences consists of categori- cal data called assemblers, which in turn determine a homotopytheoretic spectrum, whose homotopy groups embody scissors congruence relations. this formalism is applied in in the framework producing an assembler and a spectrum whose recovers the grothendieck ring of varieties. this is used to obtain a characterisation of the kernel of multiplication by the lefschetz motive, which provides a general ex- planation for the observations of , on the fact that the lefschetz motive is a zero divisor in the grothendieck ring of varieties. consider a category c and an object x in c. denition . a sieve s over x in c is a family of morphisms fi : x i x (also called objects over x) satisfying the following conditions: a) any isomorphism with target x belongs to s . b) if a morphism x x belongs to s, then its precomposition with any other morphism in c with target x x x x also belongs to s. it follows that composition of any two morphisms in s composable in c itself belongs to s so that any sieve is a category in its own right. denition . a grothendieck topology on a category c consists of the assign- ment of a collection of sieves j given for all objects x in c, with the following properties: a) the total overcategory c/x of morphisms with target x is a member of the collection j . b) the pullback of any sieve in j under a morphism f : y x exists and is a sieve in j . here pullback of a sieve is dened as the family of pullbacks of its objects, x x, whereas pullback of such an object w.r.t. y x is dened as pry : y x x y . c) given c j and a sieve t in c/x, if for every f : y x in c the pullback f t is in j then t is in j . for more details, see , chapters and , or , pp. let c be a category with a grothendieck topology. zakharevichs notion of an assembler category is then dened as follows. denition . a collection of morphisms {fi : xi x}ii in c is a covering family if the full subcategory of c/x that contains all the morphisms of c that factor through the fi, {g : y x | i i h : y xi such that fi h = g}, belongs to the sieve collection j . bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives in a category c with an initial object two morphisms f : y x and g : w x are called disjoint if the pullback y x w exists and is equal to . a collection {fi : xi x}ii in c is disjoint if fi and fj are disjoint for all i = j i. denition . an assembler category c is a small category endowed with a groth- endieck topology, which has an initial object (with the empty family as covering family), and where all morphisms are monomorphisms, with the property that any two nite disjoint covering families of x in c have a common renement that is also a nite disjoint covering family. a morphism of assemblers is a functor f : c c that is continuous for the grothendieck topologies and preserves the initial object and the disjointness property, that is, if two morphisms are disjoint in c their images are disjoint in c. for x a nite set, the coproduct of assemblers w xx cx is a category whose objects are the initial object and all the noninitial objects of the assemblers cx. morphisms of noninitial objects are induced by those of cx. consider a pair where c is an assembler category, and d is a sieve in c. one has then an associated assembler c d dened as the full subcategory of c containing all the objects that are not initial objects of d. the assembler structure on c d is determined by taking as covering families in c d those collections {fi : xi x}ii with xi, x objects in c d that can be completed to a covering family in c, namely such that there exists {fj : xj x}jj with xj in d such that {fi : xi x}ii {fj : xj x}jj is a covering family in c. moreover, there is a morphism of assemblers c cd that maps objects of d to and objects of cd to themselves and morphisms with source in cd to themselves and morphisms with source in d to the unique morphism to the same target with source . the data are called the abstract scissors congruences. the construction of -spaces, which we review more in detail in , then provides the homotopy theoretic spectra associated to assembler categories as in . this construction of assembler categories and spectra provides the formalism we use here and in the previous paper to lift bostconnes type algebras to the level of grothendieck rings and spectra. . from categories to -spaces and spectra. the segal construction asso- ciates a -space to a category c with a zero object and a categor- ical sum. let be the category of nite pointed sets with objects n = {, , . . . , n} and morphisms f : n m the functions with f = let denote the cate- gory of pointed simplicial sets. the construction can be generalized to symmetric monoidal categories, . the associated -space fc : is constructed as follows. first assign to a nite pointed set x the category p with objects all the pointed subsets of x with morphisms given by inclusions. a functor x : p c is summing if it maps p to the zero object of c and given s, s p with s s = {} the base point of x, the morphism x x x is an isomorphism. let c be the category whose objects are the summing functors joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli x with morphisms the natural transformations that are isomorphisms on all objects of p. setting c = x), for a morphisms f : x y of pointed sets and s p gives a functor c : cat to the category of small categories. composing with the nerve n gives a functor fc = n c : which is the -space associated to the category c. the functor fc : obtained in this way is extended to an endofunctor fc : via the coend fc = z n kn fc. one obtains the spectrum x = fc associated to the -space fc by setting xn = fc with maps s fc fc. the construction is functorial in c, with respect to functors preserving sums and the zero object. when c is the category of nite sets, fc is the sphere spectrum s, and when c = pr is the category of nite projective modules over a commutative ring r, the spectrum fpr = k is the k-theory spectrum of r. the segal construction determines a functor from the category of small symmetric monoidal categories to the category of -connected spectra. it is shown in that this functor determines an equivalence of categories between the stable homotopy category of -connected spectra and a localization of the category of small sym- metric monoidal categories, obtained by inverting morphisms sent to weak homotopy equivalences by the functor. given an assembler category c, one considers a category w with objects {ai}ii given by collections of non-initial objects ai in c indexed by nite sets and morphisms : {ai}ii {bj}jj consisting of a map of nite sets f : i j and morphisms i : ai bf that form disjoint covering families {i | i f }, for all j j. one then obtains a -space as the functor that assigns to a nite pointed set the simplicial set n w, the nerve of the category w where x c is the assembler x c = w xx{x} c. the spectrum associated to the assembler c is the spectrum dened by this space, namely xn = n w. for another occurrence of -spaces in the context of f-geometry, see .","In the section discussing assemblers, a formalism involving scissors congruence relations in algebraic geometric contexts is explained. This formalism utilizes categorical data known as assemblers to define a homotopy-theoretic spectrum representing scissors congruence relations.

The text also introduces the concept of an assembler category, which consists of morphisms and covering families in a specific category with a Grothendieck topology. The construction of assembler categories and homotopy-theoretic spectra forms the basis for lifting certain algebraic structures to the level of Grothendieck rings and spectra. Additionally, the Segal construction is discussed, which associates a -space to a category with a zero object and a categorial sum, leading to the generation of spectra associated with assembler categories."
"we describe in this and the next subsection a general formalism of enhanced assemblers underlying all the explicit cases of bostconnes structures in grothendieck rings discussed in and in some of the later sections of this paper. we rst recall the denition of the automorphism category. denition . the automorphism category aut of a category c is given by: objects of aut are pairs x = where x obj and vx : x x is an automorphism of x. bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives morphisms f : in aut are morphisms f : x y such that f vx = vy f : x y in c. the forgetful functor sends x to x and f to f. we use here a standard categorical notation according to which, say, f vx is the precomposition of f with vx. thus, we can make the following general denition. in the following we will be especially interested in the case where the chosen subcategory is determined by a group action, see remark . denition . let c be a category. we will call here an enhancement of c a pair consisting of a choice of a subcategory c of the automorphism category aut and the forgetful functor c c, where objects of c have automorphisms vx : x x of nite order, . the main idea here is that a subcategory category c of the automorphism category of c is where the endofunctors dening the lifts of the bostconnes structure are dened, as we make more precise in denitions and . remark . in the cases considered in and in this paper, the subcategory of c of aut is usually determined by a nite group action, so that elements of c are of the form ) with x : g x x the group action. however, one expects other interesting examples that are not necessarily given by group actions, hence it is worth considering this more general formulation. remark . assume that c is endowed with a structure of assembler. then a series of constructions presented in and of and in of this paper, and restricted there to various categories of schemes, show in fact how this structure of assembler can be lifted from c to c. in particular the bostconnes type structures we are investigating can be formu- lated broadly in this setting of enhanced assemblers as follows.","The text introduces a formalism of enhanced assemblers that underlie explicit cases of bostconnes structures in Grothendieck rings.

The concept is especially relevant when the subcategory is determined by a group action. The text suggests that the structure of an assembler in a category can be lifted to an enhanced version, allowing for the formulation of bostconnes type structures more broadly."

The text outlines a general framework for such systems and describes modifications needed for relative cases. The presentation will delve into assembler categories and explore similar structures at a motivic level using geometric diagrams and Nori motives."
"we consider the relative grothendieck ring k of varieties over a base variety s over a eld k, as in denition . an assembler cs such that the associated spectrum k has k = k given by the relative grothendieck ring k can be obtained as a slight modica- tion of the construction given in for the ordinary grothendieck ring k denition . the assembler cs for the relative grothendieck ring k has objects f : x s that are varieties over s and morphisms that are locally closed embeddings of varieties over s. lemma . the category cs of denition is indeed as assembler, with the grothendieck topology on cs is generated by the covering families {y x, x y x} joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli with compatible maps y  / f|y x f  x y ? _ o f|xy { s proof. the argument is the same as in , and in . in this setting nite disjoint covering families are maps xi  / fi x f  s where xi = yi yi with commutative diagrams y  / f + y  / f )  / yn = x f  s the category has pullbacks, hence as shown in this suces to obtain that any two nite disjoint covering families have a common renement. morphisms are embeddings compatible with the structure maps as in hence in particular monomorphisms. theorem of then shows that the spectrum k associated to this assembler category has k = k in a similar way we obtain an assembler category and spectrum for the equivariant version k z . the argument is as in the previous case and in lemma . of , using the inclusion-exclusion relations . corollary . an assembler category c z for k z ) is constructed as in lemma with objects the z-equivariant f : x s, morphisms given by z- equivariant locally closed embeddings of varieties over s and with grothendieck topol- ogy generated by the covering families given by z-equivariant maps as in and . as in proposition of , we show that the lifting of the integral bostconnes algebra obtained in proposition and theorem further lifts to functors of the associated assembler categories, with the n compatible with the monoidal structure, but not the n. theorem . the maps n : ) ) and n : ) ) )) dene functors of the assembler categories n : c z c z and n : c z c z ). the functors n are compatible with the monoidal structure. bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives proof. the functors n dened as above on objects are compatibly dened on mor- phisms by assigning to a locally closed embedding n : j / fy % fx  j / fy ( p p p p p p p p p p p p fx  similarly, we dene the n on morphisms by n : j / fy % fx  ) j / fy ) ) fx  ) the functors n are compatible with the monoidal structure since n n = n) = n ). the functor of assembler categories determines an induced map of spectra and in turn an induced map of homotopy groups. by construction the induced maps on the homotopy agree with the maps and of proposition . remark . we can associate to the assembler category c z of corollary with the endofunctors n and n a categorical bostconnes structure in the sence of denition , where the objects are f : x s as above with the automorphisms given by elements g z acting on f : x s through the action by x on x and by s on s, intertwined by the equivariant map f.","An assembler for the relative Grothendieck ring K of varieties over a base variety S can be obtained through a modification of the construction for the ordinary Grothendieck ring. The category CS consists of objects that are varieties over S and morphisms that are locally closed embeddings of varieties over S. The spectrum associated with this assembler category satisfies K = K. A similar approach yields an assembler category and spectrum for the equivariant version KZ. The assembler categories allow for the lifting of the integral bostconnes algebra to functors, with compatibility with the monoidal structure. Functors N and N are defined on objects and morphisms to be compatible with the monoidal structure. This construction leads to induced maps on homotopy groups that agree with previous propositions. The assembler category Cz can be associated with a categorical bostconnes structure using endofunctors N and N, where objects are varieties over S acted upon by elements GZ."
"in this section we relate the point of view developed in , with lifts of the bost connes system to grothendieck rings and spectra, to the approach to f-geometry based on torications. this was rst introduced in . weaker forms of torication were also considered in , which allow for the development of a form of f-geometry suitable for the treatment of certain classical moduli spaces. the approach we follow here, in order the relate the case of toried geometry with the bostconnes systems on grothendieck rings, assemblers, and spectra discussed in , is based on the following simple setting. instead of working with the equivariant grothendieck rings k z and k z , where one assumes the varieties have a good eectively nite z-action, we consider here a variant that connects to the torications point of view on f-geometry of . we replace varieties with z/nz-eectively nite z-actions with varieties with a q/z-action induced by a torication, where the group schemes mn of n-th roots of unity, given by the kernels mn gm n gm joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli determine a diagonal embedding in each torus and an action by multiplication. this is a very restrictive class of varieties, because the existence of a torication on a variety implies that the grothendieck class is a sum of classes of tori with non- negative coecients. the resulting construction will be more restrictive than the one considered in . we will see, however, that one can still see in this context several interesting phenomena, especially in connection with the dynamical approach to f-geometry proposed in . . torications. a torication of an algebraic variety x dened over z is a de- composition x = iiti into algebraic tori ti = gdi m. weaker to stronger forms of torication include torication of the grothendieck class: = p iidi with l the lef- schetz motive; geometric torication: x = iiti with ti = gdi m; ane torication: the existence of an ane covering compatible with the geometric torication, ; regular torication: the closure of each torus in the geometric torication is also a union of tori of the torication, . similarly, there are dierent possibilities when one considers morphisms of toried varieties, see . in view of describing associated grothendieck rings, we review the dierent notions of morphisms. the grothendieck classes are then dened with respect to the corresponding type of isomorphism. a toried morphism of geometric torications in the sense of between toried varieties f : is a morphism f : x y of varieties together with a map h : i j of the indexing sets of the torications x = iiti and y = jjt j such that the restriction of f to tori ti is a morphism of algebraic groups fi : ti t h. there are then three dierent classes of morphisms of toried varieties that were introduced in : strong, ordinary, and weak morphisms. to describe them, one rst denes strong, ordinary, and weak equivalences of torications, and one then uses these to dene the respective class of morphisms. let t and t be two geometric torications of a variety x. the torications and are strongly equivalent if the identity map on x is a toried morphism as above. the torications and are ordinarily equivalent if there exists an automorphism : x x that is a toried morphism. the torications and are weakly equivalent if x has two de- compositions x = ixi and x = jx j into a disjoint union of subvarieties, compatible with the torications, such that there are isomorphisms of varieties i : xi x j that are toried. in the weak case a decomposition compatible with torications means that the intersections ti xj of the tori of t with the pieces of the decomposition (when non-empty) are tori of the torication of xj, and similarly for t i x j. in general bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives weakly equivalent torication are not ordinarily equivalent because the maps i need not glue together to dene a single map on all of x. we then have the following classes of morphisms of toried varieties from : strong morphisms: these are toried morphisms in the sense of , namely morphisms that restrict to morphisms of tori of the respective torications. ordinary morphisms: an ordinary morphism of toried varieties and is a morphism f : x y such that becomes a toried morphism after composing with strong isomorphisms, that is, y f x : is a strong morphism of toried varieties, for some isomorphisms x : x x and y : y y . in other words, if we denote by t and t the torications such that x : and y : (y, t ) are toried, then f : (y, t ) is toried. weak morphisms: the toried varieties and admit decomposi- tions x = ixi and y = jyi, compatible with the torications, such that there exist ordinary morphisms fi : , t f) of these subvari- eties. note that the strong isomorphisms x : and y : (y, t ) used in the denition of ordinary morphisms are ordinary equivalences of the torications t and t, respectively t and t . given these notions of morphisms, we can correspondingly construct grothendieck rings ks, ko, and kw in the following way. as an abelian group ks is generated by isomorphism classes s of pairs of a toriable variety x and a torication t modulo strong isomorphisms, with the inclusion-exclusion relations s = s + s whenever is a strong morphism (that is, the inclusion of y in x is compatible with the torication: y is a union of tori of the torication of x) and is a complemented subvariety in , which means that the complement x y is also a union of tori of the torication so that the inclusion of in is also a strong morphism. this complemented condition is very strong. indeed, one can see that, for example, there are in general very few complemented points in a toried variety. the product operation is s s = s with the torication t t given by the product tori tij = ti t j = g di+dj m . the abelian group ko is generated by isomorphism classes o varieties that admit a torication with respect to ordinary isomorphisms, with the inclusion- exclusion relations o = o + o whenever the inclusions y x and x y x are ordinary morphisms. the product is the class of the cartesian product o o = o. the abelian group kw is generated by the isomorphism classes w of tori- able varieties x with respect to weak morphisms, with the inclusion-exclusion rela- tions w = w + w whenever the inclusions y x and x y x are weak morphisms. the product structure is again given by w w = w. joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli the reader can consult the explicit examples given in to see how these notions can be dierent. for example, as mentioned in of , consider the variety x = p p and consider on it two torications t and t , where t is the standard torication given by the decomposition of each p into cells a a, with the cell a toried as a gm, while t is the torication where in the big cell a of p p we take a torication of the diagonal a and a torication of the complement of the diagonal, and we use the same torication of the lower dimensional cells as in t. these two torications are related by a weak isomorphism, hence the elements and dene the same class in kw, but they are not related by an ordinary isomorphism so they dene dierent classes in ko. note however that, in all these cases, the grothendieck classes a with a = s, o, w have the form a = p n antn with an z+ and tn = [gn m]. in the following, whenever we simply write a = s, o, w without specifying one of the three choices of morphisms, it means that the stated property holds for all of these choices. . relative case. in a similar way, we can construct relative grothendieck rings ksa with a = s, o, w where in the strong case s = is a choice of a variety with an assigned torication, with kss generated as an abelian group by isomorphisms classes where f is a strong morphism of toried varieties and the isomorphism class is taken with respect to strong isomorphisms , s such that the diagram commutes / f  f  s / with inclusion-exclusion relations = + where y : is a strong morphism and is complemented with xy : also a strong morphism and both these inclusions are compatible with the map f : , so that fy = f y and f| = f xy are strong morphisms. the construction for ordinary and weak morphism is similar, with the appropriate changes in the denition.","The text discusses the relationship between torifications and F-geometry, connecting the Bost-Connes system on Grothendieck rings, assemblers, and spectra. Torications involve decomposing an algebraic variety into algebraic tori. Different forms of torications are considered, such as weak torications, geometric torications, ane torications, and regular torications. The text also delves into morphisms of toried varieties and introduces three classes: strong morphisms, ordinary morphisms, and weak morphisms. Grothendieck rings are constructed based on these morphisms, resulting in three different rings: KS for strong morphisms, KO for ordinary morphisms, and KW for weak morphisms. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding these notions through examples and highlights the differences between the classes of morphisms in relation to torications."
"in order to operate on grothendieck classes with bostconnes type endomorphisms, we introduce appropriate group actions. toried varieties carry natural q/z actions, since the roots of unity embed diag- onally in each torus of the torication and act on it by multiplication. however, we bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives will also be interested in considering good eectively nite z-actions, in the sense already discussed in , that is, actions of z as in denition . remark . the main reason for working with z-actions rather than with q/z actions lies in the fact that, in the construction of the geometric vershiebung action discussed in we need to be able to describe the cyclic permutation action of z/nz on the nite set zn as an action factoring through z/nz. this cannot be done in the case of q/z-actions because there are no nontrivial group homomorphisms q/z z/nz since q/z is innitely divisible. in the case of the natural q/z-actions on torications, we consider objects of the form where x is a toriable variety, t a choice of a torication, and : q/z x x an action of q/z determined by an embedding of q/z as roots of unity in gm = c, which act on each torus ti = gki m diagonally by multiplication. an embedding of q/z in gm is determined by an invertible element in hom = z, hence the action is uniquely determined by the torication t and by the choice of an element in z. the corresponding morphisms are, respectively, strong, ordinary, or weak mor- phisms of toried varieties compatible with the q/z-actions, in the sense that the resulting toried morphism (after composing with isomorphisms or with local iso- morphisms in the ordinary and weak case) are q/z-equivariant. we can then pro- ceed as above and obtain equivariant grothendieck rings kq/z s, kq/z o, and kq/z w of toried varieties. in the case of good z/nz-eectively nite z-actions, the setting is essentially the same. we consider objects of the form where x is a toriable variety, t a choice of a torication, and : z/nz x x is given by the action of the n-th roots of unity on the tori ti = gki m by multiplication. thus, a good z-action is determined by t, by the choice of an embedding of roots of unity in gm (an element of z) as above, and by the choice of n n that determines which subgroup of roots of unity is acting. this choice of good z/nz-eectively nite z-actions, with strong, ordinary, or weak morphisms whose associated toried morphisms are z/nz-equivariant, deter- mine equivariant grothendieck rings k z s, k z o, and k z w of toried vari- eties with good eectively nite z-actions. . assembler and spectrum of toried varieties. as in the previous cases of k z of and in the case of k z discussed above, we consider the grothendieck rings ks, ko, and kw and their corresponding equivariant versions kq/z s, kq/z o, kq/z w, and k z s, k z o, k z w from the point of view of assemblers and spectra developed in , , . proposition . for a = s, o, w, the category ca t has objects that are pairs of a toriable variety and a torication, with morphisms the locally closed embeddings joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli that are, respectively, strong, ordinary, or weak morphisms of toried varieties. the grothendieck topology is generated by the covering families { , } where both embeddings are strong, ordinary, or weak morphisms, respectively. the category ca t is an assembler with spectrum k(ca t ) satisfying k(ca t ) = ka. similarly, for g = q/z or g = z let cg,a t be the category with objects given by a toriable variety x with a torication t and a g-action of the kind discussed in and morphisms the locally closed embeddings that are g-equivariant strong, ordinary, or weak morphisms. the grothendieck topology is generated by covering families with g-equivariant embeddings. the category cg,a t is also an assembler, whose associated spectrum k(cg,a t ) satises k(cg,a t ) = kg a. proof. the argument is again as in , see lemma . we check that the cate- gory admits pullbacks. in the strong case, if and are objects with morphisms f : and f : given by embeddings that are strong morphisms of toried varieties. this means that the tori of the tori- cation ty are restrictions to y of tori of the torication tx of x. thus, both y and y are unions of subcollections of tori of tx. their intersection y y will then also inherit a torication consisting of a subcollection of tori of tx and the resulting embedding is a strong morphism of toried varieties. in the ordinary case, we consider embeddings f : y x and f : y x that are ordinary morphisms of toried varieties, which means that, for isomorphisms x, x, y , y , the compositions x f y : , x f y : are toried morphisms. thus, the tori of the torications ty and ty are subcollections of tori of x, under the embeddings x f y and x f y . the intersection x f y x f y x is isomorphic to a copy of y y and has an induced torication ty y by a subcollection of tori of tx. the embedding of y y in x with this image is an ordinary morphism with respect to this torication. the weak case is constructed similarly to the ordinary case on the pieces of the decomposition. the equivariant cases are constructed analogously, as discussed in the case of equivariant grothendieck rings of varieties in . corollary . there are inclusions of assemblers cs t co t cw t that induce maps of k-theory, in particular ks ko and ko kw. similarly, for the g-equivariant cases of proposition . proof. since for morphisms strong implies ordinary and ordinary implies weak, one obtains inclusions of assemblers as stated. bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives . lifting of the bostconnes system for torications. we consider here lifts of the integral bostconnes algebra to the grothendieck rings k z s, k z o, and k z w and to the assemblers and spectra k z(cs t ), k z(co t ), and k z(cw t ). denition . we regard the zero-dimensional variety zn as a toried variety with the torication consisting of n zero dimensional tori and with a good z action factoring through z/nz that cyclically permutes the points of zn. we write for this object. for a triple of a toriable variety x, a given torication t, and an eectively nite action of z, we then set, for all n n, n = and n = ) . proposition . the n and n dened as in determine endofunctors of the assembler categories c z,a t that induce, respectively, ring homomorphisms n : k z(ca t ) k z(ca t ) and group homomorphisms n : k z(ca t ) k z(ca t ) with the bostconnes relations n n = n n = n. proof. the proof is completely analogous to the case discussed in theorem and to the similar cases discussed in . remark . the n and n dened as in determine a categorical bostconnes system as in denition , where the objects are pairs and the automorphisms are elements g z acting through the eectively nite action . remark . bostconnes type quantum statistical mechanical systems associated to individual toric varieties were constructed in . here instead of bostconnes endomorphisms of individual varieties we are interested in a bostconnes system over the entire grothendieck ring and its associated spectrum. remark . variants of the construction above can be obtained by considering the multivariable versions of the bostconnes system discussed in , with actions of subsemigroups of mn+ on qn, that is, subalgebras of the crossed product algebra qn mn+ generated by e and , with ) = e = det x =r e ) = e = e). the relevance of this more general setting to f-geometries lies in a result of borger and de smit showing that every torsion free nite rank -ring embeds in some zn with the action of n determined by the -ring structure compatible with the diagonal subsemigroup of mn+. joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli","The text discusses the introduction of appropriate group actions in order to operate on grothendieck classes with bostconnes type endomorphisms.

The text also describes the construction of equivariant grothendieck rings for toried varieties under different types of actions. Furthermore, it explores the assembler and spectrum of toried varieties within these contexts, demonstrating how these actions impact the associated grothendieck rings.

"we discuss in this section the connection between the dynamical point of view on f-geometry proposed in and the point of view based on torications. we rst discuss in and the notion of f-points of a toried variety and its relation to the torication of the grothendieck class, with some explicit examples. we then introduce the f-zeta function in and we show its main properties in proposition , while in we explain the relation between the f-zeta function and the hasseweil zeta function. in we consider the point of view on f-structures proposed in based on dynamical systems inducing quasi-uniponent endomorphisms on homology, in the particular case of toried varieties with dynamical systems compatible with the tori- cation. we focus on the associated dynamical zeta functions, the lefschetz zeta function and the artinmazur zeta function, whose properties we recall in . we then prove in proposition that the resulting dynamical zeta function have similar properties to the f-zeta function in the sense that both dene exponentiable motivic measures from the grothendieck rings of toried varieties to the witt ring.","The text explores the relationship between dynamical perspectives on f-geometry and torifications in mathematics.

The text also delves into f-structures based on dynamical systems inducing quasi-unipotent endomorphisms on homology, focusing on torified varieties with compatible dynamical systems. Various dynamical zeta functions, such as the Lefschetz zeta function and Artin-Mazur zeta function, and their properties are discussed. It is shown that both the f-zeta function and resulting dynamical zeta functions define exponentiable motivic measures from the Grothendieck rings of torified varieties to the Witt ring."
"assuming that a variety x over z admits an f-structure, regarded here as one of several possible forms of toried structure recalled above, , , the number of points of x over f is computed as the q limit of the counting function nx of points over fq of the mod p reduction of x, for q a power of p. any form of toried structure in particular implies that the variety is polynomially countable, hence that the counting function nx is a polynomial in q with z-coecients. the limit limq nx, possibly normalized by a power of q , is interpreted as the number of f-points of x, see . similarly, one can dene extensions fm of f, in the sense of . these corresponds to actions of the groups mm of m-th roots of unity. in terms of a toried structure, the points over fm count m-th roots of unity in each torus of the decomposition. in terms of the counting function nx the counting of points of x over the extension fm is obtained as the value nx, see theorem of and theorem of ). summarizing, we have the following. lemma . let x be a variety over z with toried grothendieck class = n x i= aiti with coecients ai z+ and t = = l then the number of points over fm of x is given by #x = n x i= ai mi. in particular, #x = a = the euler characteristic. bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives . bialynicki-birula decompositions and toried geometries. as shown in , , the motive of a smooth projective variety with action of the multiplicative group admits a decomposition, obtained via the method of bialynicki-birula, , , . we recall the result here, in a particular case which gives rise to examples of toried varieties. lemma . let x be a smooth projective k-variety x endowed with a gm action such that the xed point locus xgm admits a torication of the grothendieck class. then x also admits a torication of the grothendieck class. consider the ltration x = xn xn x with ane brations i : xi xi zi over the components xgm = izi, associated to the bialynicki-birula decomposition. if the xed point locus xgm admits a geometric torication such that the restrictions of the brations i to the individual tori of the torication of zi are trivializable, then x also admits a geometric torication. proof. the bialynicki-birula decomposition, , , , see also , shows that a smooth projective k-variety x endowed with a gm action has smooth closed xed point locus xgm which decomposes into a nite union of components xgm = izi, of dimensions dim zi the dimension of txgm z at z zi. the variety x has a ltration x = xn xn x with ane brations i : xi xi zi of relative dimension di equal to the dimension of the positive eigenspace of the gm-action on the tangent space of x at points of zi. the scheme xi xi is identied with {x x : limt tx zi} under the gm-action t : x tx, with i = limt tx. as shown in , the object m in the category of correspondences corrk with integral coecients decomposes as m = m i m, where m are the motives of the components of the xed point set and m are tate twists. the class in the grothendieck ring k decomposes then as = x i ldi. it is then immediate that, if the components zi admit a geometric torication (re- spectively, a torication of the grothendieck class) then the variety x also does. if zi = ni j=tij with tij = g aij m or, respectively = pni j=aij, then x = n i= = n i=f di, where f di denotes the total space of the ane bration i : xi xi zi with bers adi. the grothendieck class is then toried by = n x i= ni x j= taij( + di x k= di k  tk), joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli with t = l the class of the multiplicative group t = , and where the ane spaces are toried by ln = n x k= n k  tk. if the restriction of the bration f di to the individual tori tij of the torication of zi is trivial, then it can be toried by a products tij tk of the torus tij and the tori tk of a torication of the ber ane space adi. this determines a a geometric torication of the ane brations f di, hence of x. . an example of toried varieties. a physically signicant example of toried varieties of the type described in lemma arises in the context of bps state counting of . rened bps state counting computes the multiplicities of bps particles with charges in a lattice for assigned spin quantum numbers of a spin = su su representation, see , , . we mention here the following explicit example from , namely the case of the moduli space mp of gieseker semi-stable shaved on p with hilbert polynomial equal to m + in this case, it is proved in that mp has a torus action of g m for which the xed point locus consists of isolated points and components isomorphic to p the grothendieck class, obtained through the bialynicki-birula decomposition is given by = + l + l + l + l + l +l + l + l + l + l + l +l + l + l + l + l + l note that, for a smooth projective variety with grothendieck class that is a polyno- mial in the lefschetz motive l, the poincar e polynomial and the grothendieck class are related by replacing x with l, since the variety is hodgetate. in toried form the above gives = t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + t + , where = ) is the euler characteristics, which is also the number of points over f the number of points over fm gives for m = (the number of tori in the torication), for m = , for m = , etc. in this example, the euler characteristic ), which can also be seen as the number of f-points, is interpreted physically as determining the bps counting. it is natural to ask whether the counting of fm-points, which corresponds to the counting of roots of unity in the tori of the torication, can also carry physically signicant information. bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives other examples of toried varieties relevant to physics can be found in the context of quantum eld theory, see and . . bps counting and the virtual motive. the formulation of the rened bps counting given in can be summarized as follows. the virtual motive vir = ln/, with n = dim, is a class in the ring of motivic weights k, see . when x admits a gm action and a bialynicki-birula decomposition as dis- cussed in the previous section, where all the components zi of the xed point locus of the gm-action have tate classes = p j cijlbij k, with cij z and bij z+, the virtual motive vir is a laurent polynomial in the square root l/ of the lefschetz motive, vir = x i,j cij lbij+di/, where, as before, di is the dimension of the positive eigenspace of the gm-action on the tangent space of x at points of zi. in applications to bps counting, one considers the virtual motive of a moduli space m that admits a perfect obstruction theory, so that it has virtual dimension zero and an associated invariant #virm which is computed by a virtual index #virm = vir(m, k/ m,vir) = (m, k/ m,vir om,vir), where om,vir is the virtual structure sheaf and k/ m,vir is a square root of the virtual canonical bundle, see . . the formal square root of the leftschetz motive. the formal square root l/ of the leftschetz motive that occurs in as grothendieck class can be introduced, at the level of the category of motives, as shown in of , using the tannakian formalism, . let c = num q be the tannakian category of pure motives with the numerical equivalence relation and the koszul sign rule twist in the tensor structure, with motivic galois group g = gal. the inclusion of the tate motives determines a group homomorphism t : g gm, which satises tw = with the weight homomorphism w : gm g . the category c(q( )) obtained by adjoining a square root of the tate motive to c is then obtained as the tannakian category whose galois group is the bered product g = { g gm : t = }. the construction of square roots of tate motives described in was generalized in to arbitrary n-th roots of tate motives, obtained via the same tannakian construction, with the category c(q( n)) obtained by adjoining an n-th root of the tate motive determined by its tannakian galois group g = { g gm : t = n}, with n : gm gm, n = n. the category c obtained by adjoining to c = num q arbitrary roots of the tate motives is the tannakian category with galois group joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli g = lim n g. the category c has an action of q + by automorphisms induced by the endomorphisms n of gm. these roots of tate motives give rise to a good formalism of f-geometry, with a root of unity, lying below f-geometry and expressed at the motivic level in terms of a habiro ring type object associated to the grothendieck ring of orbit categories of c, see .","The text discusses the counting of points on varieties over extensions by considering toric structures. It explains how the number of points over an extension can be computed and relates it to toried Grothendieck classes. The text also covers examples of toried varieties, such as in BPS state counting, and their implications in physics.

"for a variety x over z that is poly- nomially countable = #xp with xp the mod p reduction is a polynomial in q with z coecients) the counting of points over the extensions fm can be obtained as the values nx . as we discussed earlier, in the case of a toried variety, with grothendieck class = p i aiti with ai z+, this corresponds to the counting given in . this is the counting of the number of m-th roots of unity in each torus ti = [gi m] of the torication. for a variety x over a nite eld fq the hasseweil zeta function is given, in logarithmic form by log zfq = x m #x m tm. in the case of toried varieties, there is an analogous zeta function over f we think of this f-zeta function as dened on toried grothendieck classes, zf in the case of geometric torications, we can regard it as a function of the variety and the torication, zf, t). for simplicity of notation, we will simply write zf by analogy to the hasseweil zeta function, with log zf := x m #x m tm. lemma . let x be a variety over z with a toried grothendieck class = p k aktk with ak z+. then the f-zeta function is given by log zf = n x k= ak lik, where lis is the polylogarithm function with li = log and for k lik = (t d dt)k t t. proof. for = p k aktk with ak z+ as above, we can consider a similar zeta function based on the counting of fm-points described above. using , we obtain an expression of the form log zf = x m #x m tm = n x k= ak x m mktm = n x k= ak lik, bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives given by a linear combination of polylogarithm functions lis at integer values s such polylogarithm functions can be expressed explicitly in the form li = log and for k lik = (t d dt)k t t = k x = ! s  t t + , with s the stirling numbers of the second kind s = r! r x j= rj r j  jk. as in the case of the hasseweil zeta function over fq , the f-zeta function gives an exponentiable motivic measure. proposition . the f-zeta function is an exponentiable motivic measure, that is, a ring homomorphism zf : ka w from the grothendieck ring of toried varieties to the witt ring. proof. clearly with respect to addition in the grothendieck ring of toried varieties we have + = p i aiti + p j a jtj = p k bktk with bk = ak + a k, hence log zf = n x k= bk lik = log zf + log zf the behavior with respect to products in the grothendieck ring of toried varieties can be analyzed as in for the hasseweil zeta function. we view the f-zeta function zf = exp( n x k= ak lik) as the element in the witt ring w with ghost components #x = pn k= mk, by writing the ghost map gh : w zn as gh : z = exp( x m nm m tm) t d dt log z = x m nmtm m the ghost map is an injective ring homomorphism. thus, it suces to see that on the ghost components nm = nm nm. if = p k aktk and = p btthen = p n p k+=n akbtn and nm = p n p k+=n akbmn = nm nm. joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli","The text explains counting F1-points and the zeta function for varieties over finite fields.

"the dynamical approach to f-structures pro- posed in is based on the existence of an endomorphism f : x x that induces a quasi-unipotent morphism fon the homology h. in particular, this means that the map fhas eigenvalues that are roots of unity. in the case of a variety x endowed with a torication x = it di, one can consider in particular endomorphisms f : x x that preserve the torication and that restrict to endomorphisms of each torus t di. we recall the denition and main properties of the relevant dynamical zeta func- tions, which we will consider in proposition . . properties of dynamical zeta functions. in general to a self-map f : x x, one can associate the dynamical artinmazur zeta function and the homological lefschetz zeta function. a particular class of maps with the property that they induce quasi-unipotent morphisms in homology is given by the morsesmale dieo- morphisms of smooth manifolds, see . these are dieomorphisms characterized by the properties that the set of nonwandering points is nite and hyperbolic, con- sisting of a nite number of periodic points, and for any pair of these points x, y the stable and unstable manifolds w s and w u intersect transversely. morsesmale dieomorphisms are structurally stable among all dieomorphisms, , . the lefschetz zeta function is given by l,f = exp x m l m tm !

. the case of morsesmale dieomorphisms can be treated as in to obtain ratio- nality and a description in terms of the homological zeta functions. in the setting of real tori rd/zd, one can considers the case of a toral endomorphism specied by a matrix m md. in the hyperbolic case, the counting of isolated xed points of mm is given by | det| and the dynamical artinmazur zeta function is expressible in terms of the lefschetz zeta function, associated to the signed counting of xed points, through the fact that the lefschetz zeta function agrees with the zeta function m = exp( x n tn n an), with an = det, where an = det is a signed xed point counting. the general relation between the zeta functions for the signed det and for | det| is shown in for arbitrary toral endomorphisms, with m md. in the case of complex algebraic tori t d = gd m, one can similarly consider the endomorphisms action of the semigroup of matrices m md+ by the linear action on cd preserving zd and the exponential map z c c so that, for m = and a = exp, with the action given by = m = exp(i x b mabub). the subgroup sln mn+ acts by automorphisms. these generalize the bost connes endomorphisms n : gm gm, which correspond to the ring homomor- phisms of z given by n : p p and determine multivariable versions of the bostconnes algebra, see . we can consider in this way maps of complex algebraic tori t d c = gd m that induce maps of the real tori obtained as the subgroup t d r = ud gd m, and associate to these maps the lefschetz and artinmazur zeta functions of the induced map of real tori. bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives . torications and dynamical zeta functions. in the case of a variety with a torication, we consider endomorphisms f : x x that preserves the tori of the torication and restricts to each torus t di to a dieomorphism fi : t di r t di r . in particular, we consider toral endomorphism with a matrix mi mdi, we can associate to the pair a zeta function of the form l,f = y i l,fi, am,f = y i am,fi. proposition . the zeta functions and dene exponentiable motivic measures on the grothendieck ring kz of of with values in the witt ring w. the zeta functions dene exponentiable motivic measures on the grothendieck ring ka of toried varieties with values in w. proof. the grothendieck ring kz considered in of consists of pairs of a complex quasi-projective variety and an automorphism f : x x that induces a quasi-uniponent map fin homology. the addition is simply given by the disjoint union, and both the counting of periodic points #fix and the lefschetz numbers l behave additively under disjoint unions. thus, the zeta functions l,f and am,f, seen as elements in the witt ring w add l,ff = exp x m lm) m tm !

developed in . we will leave this topic for future work. . exponentiable measures and maps of -spaces. the problem of lifting to the level of spectra the hasseweil zeta function associated to the counting motivic measure for varieties over nite elds was discussed in . we consider here a very similar setting and procedure, where we want to lift a zeta function : k w associated to an exponentiable motivic measure to the level of spectra. to this purpose, we make some assumptions of rationality and the existence of a factorization for our zeta functions of exponentiable motivic measures. we then consider the spectrum k of , with k = k and a spectrum, obtained from a -space, associated to the subring w of the big witt ring w. denition . a motivic measure, that is, a ring homomorphism : k r of the grothendieck ring of varieties to a commutative ring r, is called factorizable is it satises the following three properties: exponentiability: the associated zeta function is a ring homomor- phism : k w to the witt ring of r; rationality: the homomorphism factors through the inclusion of the sub- ring w of the witt ring, : k w w. factorization: the rational functions admit a factorization into linear factors = q i q j = ,+ w , where ,+ = q j and , = q i and w is the dierence in the witt ring, that is the ratio of the two polynomials. joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli lemma . a factorizable motivic measure : k r, as in denition , determines a functor : cv e r where cv is the assembler category encoding the scissor-congruence relations of the grothendieck ring k and e r is the z/z- graded endomorphism category. proof. the objects of cv are varieties x and the morphisms are locally closed embed- dings, , . to an object x we assign an object of er obtained in the following way. consider a factorization = qn i= qm j= = ,+ w , as above of the zeta function of x. let ex, + = rm and ex, = rn with en- domorphisms f x, respectively given in matrix form by m(f x, + ) = diagm j= and m(f x, ) = diagn i= the pair (ex, , f x, ) is an object of the endomorphism category e r. given an embedding y x, the zeta function satises = = +w . using the factorizations of each term, this gives (ex, , f x, ) = (ey, , f y, ) (exy, , f xy, ), hence a morphism in e r given by the canonical morphism to the direct sum (ey, , f y, ) (ex, , f x, ). proposition . the functor : cv e r of lemma induces a map of - spaces and of the associated spectra : k fe r . the induced maps on the homotopy groups has the property that the composition k k(e r) k k/k = w with as in lemma , is given by the zeta function : k w proof. the -space associated to the assembler category cv is obtained in the follow- ing way, , . one rst associates to the assembler category cv another category w whose objects are nite collections {xi}ii of non-initial objects of cv with morphisms = : {xi}ii {x j}jj given by a map of the indexing sets f : i j and morphisms fi : xi x f in cv, such that, for every xed j j the collection {fi : xi x j : i f } is a disjoint covering family of the assembler cv. this means, in the case of the assembler cv underlying the grothendieck ring of varieties, that the fi are closed embeddings of the varieties xi in the given x j with disjoint images. we rst show that the functor : cv e r of lemma extends to a functor : w e r. we dene = ii = ii(exi, , f xi, ). given a covering family {fi : xi x j : i f } as above, each morphism fi : xi x j determines a morphism : (exi, , f xi, ) (e x j, , f x j, ) given by the canonical morphism bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives to the direct sum (exi, , f xi, ) (exi, , f xi, ) (e x jxi, , f x jxi, ). this deter- mines a morphism : ii(exi, , f xi, ) jj(e x j, , f x j, ). we then show that the functor : w e r constructed in this way determines a map of the associated -spaces. the -space associated to w is constructed in , as the functor that assigns to a nite pointed set s the simplicial set given by the nerve n w, where the coproduct of assemblers s cv = w ss{s} cv has an initial object and a copy of the non-initial objects of cv for each point s s {s} and morphisms induced by those of cv. this means that we can regard objects of w as collections {xs,i}ii, for some s s {s} and morphisms s = : {xs,i}ii {x s,j}jj as above. in order to obtain a map of -spaces between fv : s n w and fe r : s n e r , we construct a functor w e r from the category w described above to the category of summing functors e r . to an object xs,i := {xs,i}ii in w we asso- ciate a functor xs,i : p e r that maps a subset a+ = {s} a p to xs,i = aa where : w e r is the functor constructed above. it is a summing functor since xs,i = xs,i xs,i for a+ b+ = {s}. this induces a map of simplicial sets n w n e r which determines a natural transformation of the functors fv : s n w and fe r : s n e r . this map of -spaces in turn determines a map of the associated spectra and an induced map of their homotopy groups. it remains to check that the induced map at the level of agrees with the expected map of grothendieck rings k k(e r), hence with the zeta function when further mapped to k and to the quotient k/k this is the case since by construction the in- duced map k = k k(e r) = fe r is given by the assignment [ex, , f x, ]. corollary . the map of grothendieck rings given by the composition also lifts to a map of spectra. proof. it is possible to realize the map : k(e r) k of lemma at the level of spectra. the k-theory spectrum of an abelian category a is weakly equivalent to the k-theory spectrum of the category of bounded chain complexes over a. in fact, this holds more generally for a an exact category closed under kernels. thus, in the case of the category er, there is a weak equivalence k) k which descends on the level to the map k) k given by p kk. to an object of e r we can assign a chain complex in ch of the form , where sits in degree this descends on the level of k-theory to a map k(e r) k), which at the level of gives the map the functor e r ch used here does not respect tensor products, although the induced map : k(e r) k at the level of k is compatible with products. thus, the composition can also be lifted at the level of spectra. joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli it should be noted that the construction of a derived motivic zeta function outlined above is not the rst to appear in the literature. in , the authors describe a derived motivic measure : k k; z)) from the grothendieck spec- trum of varieties to the k-theory spectrum of the category of continuous -adic galois representations. this map corresponds to the assignment x h et,c. in particular, they show that when k = fq for coprime to q, on the level of , corresponds to the hasse-weil zeta function. they then use to prove that k is not only nontrivial, but contains interesting algebro-geometric data. essentially, the approach in was to start with a weil cohomology theory (in this case, -adic cohomology) and then to construct a derived motivic measure re- alizing on the level of k-theory the assignment to a variety x of its corresponding cohomology groups. the methods used in the case of -adic cohomology may not immediately generalize to other weil cohomology theories. this method has yielded deep insight into the world of algebraic geometry. our approach here, in contrast, is to take an interesting class of motivic measures, namely kapranov motivic zeta func- tions , and to determine reasonable conditions under which such a motivic measure can be derived directly. this method still needs to be studied further to yield additional insights into what it captures about the geometry of varieties.","The section discusses the spectrification of the endomorphism category and Witt vectors using the Segal construction.

"the lifting of the inte- gral bostconnes algebra to various grothendieck rings, their assembler categories, and the associated spectra, that we discussed in and in the earlier sections of this paper, can be viewed as an instance of a more general kind of operation. as discussed in , there is a close relation between the endomorphisms n and the maps n of the integral bostconnes algebra and the operation of frobenius and verschiebung in the witt ring. thus, we can formulate a more general form of the question investigated above, of lifting of the integral bostconnes algebra to a grothendieck ring through an euler characteristic map, in terms of lifting the frobenius and verschiebung op- erations of a witt ring to a grothendieck ring through the zeta function of an exponentiable motivic measure. a prototype example of this more general setting is provided by the hasseweil zeta function z : k w, which has the properties that the action of the frobenius fn on the witt ring w corresponds to passing to a eld extension, fnz = z and the action of the ver- schiebung vn on the witt ring w is related to the weil restriction of scalars from fqn to fq . recall that, if one denotes by the elements = in the witt ring w, for a r, then the frobenius ring homomorphisms fn : w w of the witt ring are determined by fn = and the verschiebung group ho- momorphisms vn : w w are dened on an arbitrary p w as fn : p p. these operations satisfy an analog of the bostconnes relations fnfm = fnm, vnvm = vnm, fnvn = nid, fnvm = vmfn if = bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori

of denition are akin to those used in the denitions of topological cyclic and topological restriction homology, . lemma . the frobenius and verschiebung fn and vn of denition are endofunctors of the category e r with the property that the maps they induce on w = k/k agree with the restrictions to w w of the frobe- nius and verschiebung maps. these endofunctors determine natural transformations of the -space fe r : . proof. the homomorphism k w given by l = det) sends the pair with fa acting on r as multiplication by a r to the element = in the witt ring. the action of the frobenius fn = is induced from the frobenius fn = which is an endofunctor of er. this extends to a compatible endofunctor of e r by fn = (e, f n ). similarly, the verschiebung map that sends det) det) is induced joshua

on e r induce natural transformations of the -space fe r : by composition of the summing functors : p e r in e r with the endofunctors fn and vn of e r. proposition . let : k r be a factorizable motivic measure, as in denition , that is of homotopical bostconnes type. then the endofunctors n and n of the assembler category cv determine natural transformations (still denoted by n and n) of the associated -space fv : that t in the commutative diagrams fv / n  fe r fn  fv / fe r fv / n  fe r vn  fv / fe r where : fv fe r is the natural transformation of -spaces of and fn and vn are the natural transformations of lemma . proof. the natural transformation is determined as in proposition by the functor : cv e r that assigns : x (ex , f x ) constructed as in lemma . suppose we have endofunctors n and n of the assembler category cv that induce maps n and n on k that lift the frobenius and verschiebung maps of w through the zeta function : k w. this means that , t) = fn and ( n, t) = vn = . by lemma , we have fn = l(fn(ex , f x )) = l(ex , (f x )n) and vn = l(vn(ex , f x )) = l((ex )n, vn(f x )). this shows the compatibilities of the natural transformations in the diagrams above.","The section discusses the lifting of the integral Bost-Connes algebra to various Grothendieck rings through an Euler characteristic map, connecting endomorphisms and maps in the Bost-Connes

"we apply a construction similar to the one discussed in the previous subsections to the case of the map p spec m that assigns to a variety over c with a quasi-unipotent map the spectrum of the induced map fin homology, seen as an element in z, as in of . in this section the term spectrum will appear both in its homotopy theoretic sense and in its operator sense. indeed, we consider here a

functor : vect q q/z vect and with aut = spec( qg) and g = gal( q/q), see theorem of . the category vect q q/z is endowed with additive symmetric monoidal functors n = w and nr = r : n=r wr if r is in the range of n and zero otherwise and additive functors n = w n and nr = wn satisfying n n = n id that induce the bostconnes maps on q. as shown in theorem of , this category can be equivalently described as a category of automorphisms aut q q/z with objects pairs of a q-vector space v and a g-equivariant diagonalizable automorphism of w with eigenvalues that are roots of unity . there is an equivalence of categories between vect q q/z and aut q q/z under which the functors n and n correspond, respectively, to the frobenius and verschiebung on aut q q/z, given by fn : , vn : ), with vn =

the rst description of the categorication in terms of the tannakian category vect q q/z is closer to the integral bostconnes alge- bra as introduced in , while its equivalent description in terms of aut q q/z is closer to the reinterpretation of the bostconnes algebra in terms of frobenius and verschiebung operators, as in . since we have introduced here the bostconnes algebra in the form of , we are recalling both of these descriptions of the cate- gorication, even though in the following we will be using only the one in terms of aut q q/z. proposition . let cz c be the assembler category

"we now construct a bostconnes system on a category of nori motives obtained from the diagram d(v z) described above, which lifts to the level of motives the categorication of the bostconnes algebra

theorem of or in terms of an equivalent tannakian category aut q q/z endowed with frobenius and verschiebung functors. we are going to use here the second description. bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives lemma . the assignment t : , , i) hi, y , q) deter- mines a representation t : d(v z) aut q q/z of the diagram d(v z) constructed above. proof. as discussed in the previous subsection, we view elements , , i) of d(v z) in terms of an enhancement v of the category v dened as in , by choosing a primitive root of unity that generates the cyclic group z/nz, so that the actions x and y are determined by self maps vx and vy as in . we identify the element above with , , i), which we also denoted by ( x, y , i) in the previous subsection. since the embedding y x is z-equivariant, the map vy is the restriction to y of the map vx under this embedding. we denote by i the induced map on the cohomology hi, y , q). the eigenspaces of i are the subspaces of the decomposition of hi, y , q) according to characters of z, that is, elements in hom( z, c) = q/z. thus, we obtain an object , y , q), i) in the category aut q q/z. edges in the diagram are z- equivariant maps so they induce morphisms between the corresponding objects in the category aut q q/z. one can also see in a similar way that the ber functor t : , , i) hi, y , q) determines an object in the category vec q q/z. indeed, the pair with y x is endowed with compatible good eectively nite z-actions x and y , hence the singular cohomology hi, y , q) carries a resulting z- representation. thus, the vector space hi, y , q) can be decomposed into eigenspaces of this representations according to characters hom( z, gm) = q/z. thus, we obtain a decomposition of hi, y , q) = rq/z vr as a q/z-graded vector space. we choose to work with the category aut q q/z because the bost connes structure is more directly expressed in terms of frobenius and verschiebung, which will make the lifting of this structure to the resulting category of nori motives more immediately transparent, as we discuss below. the representation t : d(v z) aut q q/z replaces, at this motivic level, our previous use in of the equivariant euler characteristics k z z (see ) as a way to lift the bostconnes algebra. we proceed in the following way to obtain the bostconnes structure in this setting. denition . let d be a diagram, endowed with a representation t : d aut q q/z, and let c be the associated diagram category, obtained as in , with the induced functor t : c aut q q/z. we say that the functor t intertwines the bostconnes structure, if there are endofunctors n and n of c (where the n but not the n are compatible with the tensor product structure) such joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli that the following diagrams commute, c t / n  aut q q/z fn  c t / aut q q/z c t / aut q q/z c t / n o aut q q/z vn o where on the right-hand-side of the diagrams, the fn and vn are the frobenius and verschiebung on aut q q/z, dened as in and . denition . for , , i) in the category c(d(v z), t) of nori motives associated to the diagram d(v z) dene n : , , i) , , i) n : , , i) ,

diagram d(v z). the representation t : d(v z) aut q q/z constructed above has the property that the induced functor c(d(v z), t) aut q q/z intertwines the endofunctors n and n of the bostconnes system on c(d(v z), t) and the frobenius fn and verschiebung vn of the bostconnes structure on aut q q/z. proof. consider the mappings n and n dened in and , the eect of the transformation n, when written in terms of the data , , i) is to send vx vn x and vy vn y , hence it induces the frobenius map fn acting on , y , q), i) in aut q q/z. similarly, we have t, (y zn, n), i) = hi where by the relative version of the k unneth formula we have zn, y zn, q) hi, y , q)n with the induced map vn. the maps n and n dened as above determine self maps of the diagram d(v z). by lemma . of given a map f : d d of diagrams and a representation t : d r-mod, there is an r-linear exact functor bostconnes and f: grothendieck rings, spectra, nori motives f : c c such that the following diagram commutes: d f /  d  c f / ' c xqqqqqqqqqq r-mod we still denote by n and n the endofunctors induced in this way on c(d(v z), t). to check the compatibility of the n functors with the monoidal structure, we use the fact that for nori motives the product structure is constructed using good pairs , that is, elements with the property that hj = for j = i. for such elements the product is given by = . the diagram category c obtained by replacing eective pairs pairseff with good eective pairs goodeff is equivalent to c , hence the tensor structure dened in this way on c determines the tensor structure of c and on the resulting category of nori motives, see of . thus, to check the compatibility of the functors n with the tensor structure it suces to see that on a product of good pairs, where indeed we have n, , i) n((x, x), (y , y ), j) = ((xx, (x x)n), ((xy , (x y )n)(y x, (y x)n)), i+j) = n, , i) ((x, x), (y , y ), j)). the functors n are not compatible with the tensor product structure, as expected. remark . in a motivic interpretation of the categorication of the bost connes algebra is given by identifying the tannakian category vec q q/z with a limit of orbit categories of tate motives. here we presented a dierent motivic cate- gorication of the bostconnes algebra by lifting the bostconnes structure to the level of the category of nori motives. in a motivic bostconnes structure was also constructed using the category of motives over nite elds and the larger class of weil numbers replacing the roots of unity of the bostconnes system.","A bostconnes system on a category of Nori motives

"we conclude this section on bostconnes systems and nori motives by formulating a question about nori diagrams and assembler categories. according to the nori formalism as it is presented in , we must start with a geometric category c of spaces/varieties/schemes, possibly endowed with addi- tional structures, in which one can dene morphisms of closed embeddings y x and morphisms of complements to closed embeddings x y x, then the nori diagram of eective pairs d is dened as in , pp. , see . joshua f. lieber, yuri i. manin, and matilde marcolli in the current context, objects of our category c will be assemblers c (of course, described in terms of a category of lower level). in particular, each such c is endowed with a grothendieck topology. a vertex of the nori diagram d will be a triple where its rst two terms are taken from an abstract scissors congruence in c, and i is an integer. intuitively, this means that we we are considering the canonical embedding c\d c as an analog of closed embedding. this intuition makes translation of the remaining components of noris diagrams obvious, except for one: what is the geometric meaning of the integer i in ? the answer in the general context of assemblers, seemingly, was not yet suggested, and already in the algebraicgeometric contexts is nonobvious and nontrivial. briey, i translates to the level of nori geometric diagrams the weight ltration of various cohomology theories , and the existence of such translation and its structure are encoded in several versions of noris basic lemma independently and earlier discovered by a. beilinson and k. vilonen (cf. , , pp. ). the most transparent and least technical version of the basic lemma (, theo- rem . , p. ) shows that in algebraic geometry the existence of weight ltration is based upon special properties of ane schemes. as we will see in the last section, lifts of bostconnes algebras to the level of cohomology based upon the techniques of enhancement also require a denition of ane assemblers. since we do not know its combinatorial version, the enhancements that we can study now, force us to return to algebraic geometry. this challenge suggests to think about other possible geometric contexts in which dimensions/weights of the relevant objects may take, say, padic values (as in the theory of padic weights of automorphic forms inaugurated by j. p. serre), or rational values , or even real values . can one transfer the scissors congruences imagery there? see, for example, the formalism of farey semiintervals as base of adic topology.","The text discusses Nori geometric diagrams for assemblers, highlighting a challenge related to the interpretation of integers in the context of Nori diagrams. It introduces the concept of assemblers in a geometric category, with a focus on the Grothendieck topology. The Nori diagrams involve triples with abstract scissors congruence elements and an integer component, which translates to the weight filtration of cohomology theories. The challenge lies in understanding the geometric meaning of these integers, especially in the context of assemblers. The text suggests exploring different geometric contexts where dimensions/weights could have p-adic, rational, or real values, potentially involving concepts such as Farey semi-intervals and adic topology."

"four-dimensional superconformal eld theories have been studied for many years. we have learned a lot especially in n = , , and cases. however, n = theories are not well understood. this is because genuine n = theories, which do not have hidden n = supersymmetry, have no lagrangian description and realized only at the strong coupling regime. in recent years, some progress has been made toward understanding of the theories. aharony and evtikhiev derived some universal properties of n = theories from arguments based on the n = superconformal algebra. in particular, they showed that genuine n = theories cannot have marginal deformations. see also for more comprehensive analysis of marginal deformations. the absence of marginal deformations is consistent to the well-known fact that the only n = free eld multiplet is the vector multiplet, which is after the cpt completion equivalent to the n = vector multiplet. therefore, a construction of a genuine n = theory is necessarily non-perturbative. a class of n = theories were constructed in as the theories on d- branes in s-fold backgrounds. (see also for a construction of related su- pergravity backgrounds.) s-folds are generalization of the orientifold. from the viewpoint of f-theory, the orientifold with + dimensional xed plane is a z orbifold accompanied by the rotation of the toric ber by angle . if the modulus of the toric ber takes one of the special values = exp , we can dene the s-fold as the zk orbifold of the spacetime accompanied by the /k rotation of the toric ber. this leaves supersymmetries unbroken, and if we put d-branes parallel to the xed plane, a four-dimensional n = theory is realized on the worldvolume. we call them s-fold theories. an s-fold theory is specied by the order k of the s-fold group zk, the rank n, which is the number of d-branes, and, in addition, an integer p associated with the discrete torsion of the ns-ns and the r-r three-form uxes . we denote the theory by s. because s-fold theories are dened by using the brane construction, it is natural to analyze them with the ads/cft correspondence . for the n = su supersymmetric yang-mills theory it was rst pointed out in that there is a one-to-one correspondence between bps operators in the sym and kaluza-klein modes in adss , and the agreement of the superconformal indices and the bps partition functions calculated on the two sides of the duality were demonstrated in . for s-folds, the gravity background is replaced by ads s/zk, and the superconformal index in the large n limit was obtained by a simple zk projection in . a relation between wrapped branes around non-trivial cycles in s/zk and gauge invariant operators was also discussed in . in this paper we focus on bps partition functions of s-fold theories. par- ticularly, we construct grand partition functions for n = theories associ- ated with operators made of the scalar elds . the taylor expansion of these grand partition functions generates the partition functions for an arbitrary n. the gauge invariant operators made of the scalar elds form the coor- dinate ring of the moduli space. the moduli spaces of the s-fold theories are all orbifolds of the form ms = cn/ws. there is a general formula known as the molien series which gives the partition function for an arbitrary orbifold. see for an application to the theories on d-branes probing orbifolds. the molien series is also applicable to s-fold theories, and in this sense our result is not novel. however, the formula we derive in this paper has very simple structure which cannot be seen in the molien series, and the correspondence to the holographic picture is clearer. in particular, the formula gives separately the contribution of each sector specied by the d-brane winding number in the internal space s/zk. we show that the same formula is reproduced from the analysis of d-branes. this paper is organized as follows. in the next section we review the bps partition function of the n = u sym following . the resulting partition function is the same as that of n bosonic particles in a three- dimensional harmonic potential. in section we construct grand partition functions for n = sym theories with so and sp gauge groups realized by orientifolds. these can be regarded as s-folds with k = in section we generalize the results of section and construct grand partition functions for k = , , and theories. we conrm that the partition function is consistent to the supersymmetry enhancement proposed in . we also comment on some relations among partition functions via discrete gaugings. in section we reproduce the same formula by quantizing d-branes in s/zk. finally, in section we discuss our results and open questions. in appendix a we give the denition of the molien series and its application to the u theory. bps partition functions of u sym in this section we review the bps partition function for the n = u sym , which has been well understood, and dene some notations which will be used in the following sections. analysis in this section is based mainly on . see also for a generalization to a large class of theories associated with calabi-yaus. bps partition function the bps partition function of an n = sym is dened by z = tr, where the trace is taken over gauge invariant bps operators consisting of the adjoint scalar elds x, y, and z. j, j, and j are cartan generators of sur. we use an so basis for these generators. namely, j, j, and j count the numbers of x, y, and z, respectively. there are several types of bps operators. operators consisting of one of the scalar elds, say, z, preserve half of supersymmetries, and are called -bps operators. in the context of the n = subalgebra z is regarded as the scalar component of the n = vector multiplet, and the -bps operators are called coulomb branch operators. the corresponding partition function is often called the coulomb branch hilbert series. bps operators consisting of x and y preserve quarter supersymmetry, and are called -bps operators. -bps operators are also called higgs branch op- erators because x and y belong to the n = hypermultiplet, and operators made of them parameterize the higgs branch. the corresponding partition function is often called the higgs branch hilbert series. the most general bps operators consisting of the three scalar elds x, y, and z preserve only two supersymmetries, and are called -bps operators. although all gauge invariant operators made of x, y, and z are bps when gym = , some of them become non-bps if we turn on the coupling constant. in this paper we are interested in bps operators in theories with non-vanishing coupling constant. if we take the trace over ( , ) bps operators in , the partition function is called the ( , , respectively) bps partition function. because and bps operators form subsets of -bps operators, once we obtain the -bps partition function, the and bps partition functions are obtained by the following specializations: z -bps = z|x=y=, z -bps = z|z= in the following, we describe bps operators in two ways. the rst is the casimir representation in which we represent operators as polynomials of trace operators . the other is the oscillator representation in which we give gauge invariant operators as poly- nomials of diagonal components of scalar elds. the former is convenient to describe -bps operators and we can easily calculate the -bps partition function with this representation for an arbitrary gauge group. the latter is suitable to describe more general bps operators and enable us to calculate the -bps partition function of the u sym. -bps partition function we rst discuss the -bps sector. an operator in the -bps sector consists only of one adjoint scalar eld z. in general the coulomb branch chiral ring of an n = sym is freely generated by the casimir operators made of the scalar eld z. the number of independent casimir operators is the same as the rank of the gauge group. let oi be the independent casimir operators and di be their scaling dimensions. the -bps partition function is given in terms of di by z -bps = r y i= zdi = pexp r x i= zdi ! , where pexp is the plethystic exponential dened by pexp ) = exp x m= mf(xm i ) ! . this is a general formula applicable to the n = sym with an arbitrary gauge group. the dimensions di for some groups are shown in table table : the dimensions di of generating casimir operators for gauge groups g g di u , , , . . ., n su , , , . . ., n so , , , . . ., n ; n so, sp , , , . . . , n g , let us consider the u case more explicitly. the casimir operators are oi = tr, . operators tr with i n + are not independent of them and decompos- able into smaller traces. the partition function is z -bps u = n y k= zk = pexp  z + z + + zn . to study the and -bps sectors the oscillator representation is more suitable. let us rst use this representation to the -bps sector and later generalize it to the -bps sector. we diagonalize the scalar eld z by the gauge transformation and let zi be the diagonal components. -bps gauge invariant operators are polynomials of these n variables that are invariant under the weyl group wu = sn. we can use the set of following symmetric polynomials as a basis. x sn n y i= zmi . gauge invariant operators can be regarded as functions in the moduli space, and the symmetric polynomials are generators of the coordinate ring of the coulomb branch moduli space mc = cn/wu. these basis functions are labeled by a vector of n non-negative integers {m, . . . , mn}. this is the same as the hilbert space of n one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. two vectors with dierent orders of the components are identied, and this is interpreted as the bose statistics of the particles. namely, the -bps partition function of the u theory is identical to the partition function of n bosonic particles in the one-dimensional harmonic potential. the equivalence of two descriptions, the casimir representation and the oscillator representation, becomes obvious if we use partitions to specify op- erators. in the casimir representation, we can adopt the set of operators oioioi oip, labeled by a non-ascending series of integers bounded by n with an arbitrary length as a basis of gauge invariant operators. in the oscillator representation, the symmetric polynomials are labeled by n non-negative integers in non- ascending order: m m mn elements of both bases are labeled by a non-ascending series of non-negative integers, each of which can be represented as a young diagram. the two young diagrams are transposition of each other, and the two descriptions give the same partition function. in the oscillator representation, it is natural to dene the grand partition function -bps u = x n= z -bps u tn. we use as a wildcard character to represent the summation over the rank n. the grand partition function is given as the product of the partition function of each state of the harmonic oscillator, -bps u = y k= tzk = pexp  t z  . we can easily show by the q-binomial formula that is obtained from by the taylor expansion with respect to t. in k = , , , . . . labels energy eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator. it is important that k starts from zero corresponding to the ground state. when the energy of the whole system of n particles is much smaller than n, only small part of n particles are excited, and the majority of the particles are in the ground state. the niteness of n aects the degeneracy of states only when the energy is comparable to or greater than n. -bps partition function let us move on to the -bps operators. in this case we can use single trace operators made of x, y, and z as generators of the chiral ring. however, it is known that unlike the -bps sector the chiral ring is not freely generated and there are non-trivial relations called syzygies among the generators, and it is not so easy to count independent operators in the casimir representation. the oscillator representation is more suitable. indeed, it is quite easy to give a set of independent operators in the oscillator representation, and we can nd that they are equivalent to the states of n bosonic particles in a three- dimensional harmonic potential as is shortly explained. thanks to the f-term conditions = = = we can diagonalize the three elds x, y, and z simultaneously by the gauge trans- formation. let be the diagonal components. the symmetric polynomial is replaced by x sn n y i= mi, y, z), where m = xmxymyzmz is the monomial which is labeled by a three- dimensional vector m = with non-negative integer components. as in the -bps case these can be regarded as basis functions of the coordi- nate ring of the total moduli space m = cn/wu. we regard m as the wave function of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the state specied by m. the symmetrization is again interpreted as the bose statistics, and can be regarded as the wave function of n bosonic particles in the three-dimensional harmonic potential. the grand partition function is u = pexp ) = y p,q,r= xpyqzrt, where i is the function i = . by picking up the coecient of the tn term from the taylor expansion of we obtain zu, the -bps partition function of the u theory. in appendix a we show that the bps partition functions obtained from are equal to those from the molien series. interestingly, this partition function can be reproduced on the gravity side as the contribution of sphere giants or ads giants . descriptions of two types of giant gravitons are complementary, and each of them gives the result identical to . we call the function i in the single-particle partition function by two reasons: i is the partition function of a single three-dimensional harmonic os- cillator. from the viewpoint of the gravity dual in the large n limit i can be regarded as the partition function of a single kk particle in s (up to the dierence by ). concerning the second reason, the n limit of zu can be read o from the pole of u at t = as zu = lim t  u  = pexp . in the last expression eliminates the contribution of the harmonic os- cillator ground state. therefore, only the excited states of the harmonic oscillator correspond to the kk gravitons. we can dene the single-particle partition function iu for nite n by zu = pexp  iu  . for the -bps states, the nite n correction is given as the simple cut-oat o. .) for and -bps states, the nite n correction becomes more complicated. we point out that the u partition function agrees with the function i: zu = i. we also note that the su partition function can be obtained by removing the u factor from the u partition function: zsu = zu zu . bps partition functions for so and sp the- ories -bps partition function let us extend the derivations of bps partition functions in the last section to the so and sp gauge theories. we rst consider the -bps sector. for so theories, the adjoint elds become anti-symmetric matrices, and the trace operators with odd order become identically zero, and only ones with even order exist. in addition, for so, the pfaan operator pf z joins the generators of the chiral ring. let us rst consider the so theory. the generators are tr, tr, , tr, tr. these freely generate the coulomb branch chiral ring, and the corresponding partition function is z -bps so = pexp  z + + zn . this is obtained simply by replacing z in zu by z therefore, the grand partition function is also obtained from by the same replacement: -bps so = x n= z -bps sotn = pexp  t z  . in the so case the generators are tr z, tr z, , tr zn, pf z. although we can of course directly calculate z -bps so by the general formula , it is instructive to give it by using . the dierence of the list of generators from is that the pfaan pf z joins the generators, and instead tr zn becomes a dependent operator which is decomposable into det z = and smaller traces. correspondingly, z -bps so is obtained from z -bps so by removing the factor / and introducing the new factor /: z -bps so = zn zn z -bps so = z -bps so. the corresponding grand partition function is -bps so = x n= z -bps sotn = -bps so + -bps so = pexp  tiz  + pexp  tiz  , where iz m are dened by iz = z = i + i , iz = z z = i i . these are even and odd part of i i, respectively. namely, i = iz + iz , and they satisfy iz m = miz m . -bps partition function we can obtain similar expressions to and for the -bps partition functions by using the oscillator description. let us consider the so case rst. similarly to the u case, we can diagonalize x, y, and z simultaneously by the gauge transformation so that they become elements of son so, and eigenvalues and associated with the i-th so factor always appear in pair except a single zero corresponding to the (n + )-th direction. gauge invariant operators, or functions in the moduli space cn/wso, are expressed as polynomials of n variables xi, yi, and zi. we treat a triplet as the coordinates of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. the weyl group wso = sn zn consists of permutations among these n triplets and sign change for an arbitrary i, which is realized by so rotation acting on the r consisting of the two directions associated with the i-th so factor in and the exceptional -th direction. again, we can regard this as a system of n bosonic particles in the three-dimensional harmonic potential. the invariance under the sign change requires the wave function of each particle to be even under the z action. namely, the one-particle wave function must satisfy = . this condition projects out one-particle states with odd energy eigenvalues, and the grand partition function is given by so = pexp  tiz  , where iz = + i) . on the ads side, has a clear interpretation at least in the large n limit. we can treat the fugacities x, y, and z as if they are the coordinates of c which contains s the z action is nothing but the orientifold action, and can be regarded as the single- particle partition function of kk modes in s/z in the so case, we can again use n triplets to describe gauge invariant operators. the dierence from the so case is that the weyl group of so is wso = snzn and we cannot change the signs independently for each i, because there is no room to perform the so rotation which we used to ip the sign in the so case. although we can change signs of two triplets simultaneously, it is not possible to change the sign of a single triplet. this restriction of the sign change weakens the requirement of the weyl invariance, and in addition to we have the other solution for the wave function, which satises the twisted boundary condition = . the associated projection leaves odd order terms in the taylor expansion of the single-particle partition function, iz = i) , and gives the grand partition function pexp  tiz  . namely, the -bps grand partition function of the so sym is the sum of two contributions just like the -bps partition function , so = pexp  tiz  + pexp  tiz  . the twisted boundary condition removes even energy eigenvalues of the harmonic oscillator. in particular, oscillators in the twisted sector cannot be in the zero energy ground state. all n oscillators contribute at least one unit to the energy, and the total energy is at least n. therefore, it is natural to identify the twisted sector to the contribution of the pfaan type operators including the tensor. this sector decouples in the large n limit, and is eective only for nite n. how should we interpret this twisted sector on the gravity side? it is known that a gauge invariant operator containing the tensor corresponds to a d-brane wrapped around the non-trivial three-cycle in s/z . the mass of the wrapped d-brane is n/, and the corresponding operator has dimension n. therefore, it is natural to identify the twisted sector to the contribution of a wrapped d-brane. we can calculate the partition function of the sp theory in a similar way. the scalar elds x, y, and z are nn matrices, and we can diagonal- ize them so that they become elements of spn sp. each sp factor is associated with the coordinates of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. unlike the so case we can ip the sign of the coordinates of each particle independently by the rotation in the sp factor, and therefore wsp = wso. the condition imposed on the wave function is the same as in the so case, and the partition function is given by . this is of course the expected result from the montonen-olive duality. as we saw above, the dierence between so and so = sp is the choice of sectors summed up. for unied description of these formulas we introduce the parameter p z, which is p = for so and p = for so and sp. then, the formulas and are unied into s = x pm= pexp  tiz m  . the summation is taken over m {, } satisfying pm = namely, m = , for p = and m = for p = from the viewpoint of the gravity dual, p is related to the discrete torsion of the three-form uxes . in string theory so and sp theories are realized by using o-planes. there are four types of planes o and f o , which are distinguished by an element of the discrete torsion group associated with the three-form ux elds: h(s/z, ^ z + z) = z + z, where ^ z + z is the sheaf of a pair of integers twisted by the orientifold action. the trivial element corresponds to p = , and the others to p = as a consistency check, we can easily conrm that the formulas for u, for u, for su, for so, and for so are consistent to lie algebra isomorphisms. namely, the following relations hold. zso = zu, zso = zsu, zso = ), zso = zsu.","The text discusses four-dimensional superconformal field theories, particularly focusing on the challenges and progress in understanding theories with n = 1 supersymmetry. Genuine n = 1 theories lack a Lagrangian description and are only realized at strong coupling. Recent advancements using arguments based on the n = 1 superconformal algebra have shed light on these theories. Aharony and Evtikhiev derived universal properties, showing that genuine n = 1 theories cannot undergo marginal deformations. The text explores theories on d-branes in s-fold backgrounds, generalizations of orientifolds, along with applications of the Molien series formula for orbifolds. Detailed discussions on bps partition functions for n = 1 theories with various gauge groups are presented, showing connections to harmonic potentials and oscillators. The grand partition functions are constructed for n = 1 sym theories, with analysis extending to n = 2 sym theories and comparisons to supersymmetry enhancements. The n = 1 theories associated with SO and SP gauge groups are also examined, with insights into bps partition functions in these contexts. The relationships between u, so, and sp theories are explored, with a unified expression incorporating discrete torsion of three-form fluxes. The consistency of the results to Lie algebra isomorphisms is emphasized, providing valuable insights into these superconformal field theories."

"a zk s-fold with k = , , is dened as a generalization of the orientifold by replacing the z action by the zk action which also acts non-trivially on one of the four supercharges in the n = sym . in the following subsections we study bps partition functions of such theories. before starting the analysis let us carefully choose the zk action on the scalar elds and comment on the relations to the coulomb branch and higgs branch hilbert series. the choice of zk is not unique and depends on the choice of the eliminated supercharge in the reduction from n = to n = this must be consistent to the denition of the bps partition function, in which we need to use one supercharge to write down the bps condition. each of the choices of a supercharge breaks sur symmetry to su u, and the scalar elds in the vector representation split into + + , holomorphic ones and anti-holomorphic ones. namely, a choice of supercharge xes a complex structure in r the scalar elds x, y, and z are holomorphic with respect to the complex structure associated with the supercharge used in the bps condition. what is important is that the supercharge chosen in the construction of the s-fold should be dierent from the one used in the bps condition. as a consequence the s-fold action on x, y, and z cannot be homogeneous. we adopt the convention with ( k x, ky, kz), k = exp i k  . if we are interested in the coulomb branch or the higgs branch hilbert series we need to choose an n = subalgebra in the n = algebra. again, we need to specify one supercharge from three, that is not contained in the n = subalgebra. this again gives a corresponding complex structure, which is dierent from the ones appearing above. this splits three scalar elds x, y, and z into one belonging to an n = vector multiplet and two belonging to an n = hypermultiplet. this + splitting is dierent from that associated with the s-folding. namely, the scalar eld belonging to the n = vector multiplet cannot be x. if we adopt the convension in which z belongs to the n = vector multiplet the coulomb branch hilbert series is obrained from the bps partition function given below by the specialization x = y = as shown in .","An S-fold theory with zk action is a generalization of orientifold theory, affecting one of the supercharges in n=4 sym supermultiplet. The BPS partition functions of such theories are studied by choosing the zk action on scalar fields, related to Coulomb and Higgs branch Hilbert series. The choice of zk is crucial, as it determines complex structures and symmetries in the theory. Different supercharges are used for the s-fold construction and BPS conditions to ensure consistency. The scalar fields split into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic components based on chosen supercharges, with specific conventions for the s-fold action. Selection of supercharges also influences the split of scalar fields into n= vector and hypermultiplet components. The Coulomb branch Hilbert series is derived from the BPS partition function with specialization of scalar fields."
"let us generalize the formula to s-folds with k = , , we use the oscillator representation. namely, we express gauge invariant operators as polynomials which are invariant under the weyl group ws. of course an s-fold theory with k is not a gauge theory, and we cannot dene the weyl group as a subgroup of the gauge group. however, because an s-fold theory is dened as the theory on d-branes, we can dene ws as the permutation group of n d-branes put in the s-fold background. aharony and tachikawa proposed the action of ws on the coulomb branch coordinates zi by generalizing the weyl groups for k = and k = cases. we simply generalize it to the total moduli space, and dene ws as the group generated by the following operations. {, } {, }, i = j, {, } {( k xi, kyi, kzi), (kxj, k yj, k zj)}, i = j, (p k xi, p kyi, p kzi). the integer p in can be assumed to be a divisor of k. we use p = instead of p = k. we want to interpret these operations from the viewpoint of the oscillator description. we regard a function of n variables as the wave function of an n-particle system, and require it to be invariant under , , and . the rst operation generates permutations of n particles, and the invariance under this operation can be implemented as the bose statistics of the particles, and the n-particle wave function is given in the form . the invariance under the second operation requires all single-particle wave functions satisfy a common boundary condition ( k x, ky, kz) = m k , where the integer m {, , , . . . , k } is common for all particles, and species one of k sectors. m = is the untwisted sector and the others are twisted sectors. the corresponding single-particle partition function is izk m = k k x = m k ( k x)( ky)( kz) = x nx,ny,nz xnxynyznz, where the summation p nx,ny,nz is taken over the three integers satisfying the conditions nx, ny, nz , nx + ny + nz = m mod k. izk m satises izk m ( k x, ky, kz) = m k izk m , and reproduces and for k = in the m-th sector with m = the zk projection leaves only single-particle states with non-vanishing energies, and the lowest energy of the n-particle system is of order n. these states are related to the pfaan-like operators. on the gravity side we regard m-th sector as the contribution of wrapped d-brane with the winding number m h = zk. the grand partition function is obtained by summing up the contribution of sectors. the contribution of the m-th sector is pexp  tizk m  , and the sectors summed up are determined by the invariance under . it requires m to satisfy the condition pm = mod k. namely, the grand partition function is given by s = x pm= pexp  tizk m  = x pm= y nx,ny,nz txnxynyznz , where the product in the nal expression is taken over three integers satis- fying the conditions . this is the main result in this paper. as is explained in , p is related to the discrete torsion in the gravity dual, and it is shown that only p = or p = is allowed for a consistent theory. the discrete torsion group for the zk s-fold is = h(s/zk, ^ z + z), where ^ z + z is the sheaf of a pair of integers twisted by the s-fold action. for each k this is given by : = z + z, = z, = z, = the sectors summed up are determined by the condition that the gauge bundle of the corresponding wrapped d-brane is consistently dened. if the discrete torsion is trivial, this is the case for an arbitrary winding number m h = zk, and this corresponds to p = otherwise, the non- trivial ns-ns and r-r three-form uxes induce electric and magnetic charge on the worldvolume of the wrapped d-brane. this obstructs the denition of the gauge bundle, and only m = sector is allowed. this corresponds to p = in the large n limit only the m = sector contributes to the partition function and reduces to zs = lim t  s  = pexp  izk  . holds not only for the bps partition function but also for the superconformal index. this was used in to calculate the superconfor- mal indices of s-folds in the large n limit.) susy enhancement from n = to n = it is known that in s-fold theories s and s with k = , , the supersymmetry is enhanced from n = to n = . let us conrm the consistency of our formula to this phenomenon. for the trivial discrete torsion p = the grand partition function is the sum of the contributions of all sectors m = , . . . , k : s = k x m= pexp  izk m t  . by picking up t terms from we obtain the partition function of the rank one s-fold theories zs = k x m= izk m = i, and this is the partition function of the n = u theory. the rank two s-fold theories are expected to be equivalent to n = sym with the gauge groups shown in table table : n = syms expected to be equivalent to s. s-folds n = syms k = su k = so k = g the coecient of t term in s is zs = k x m= h izk m +  izk m i . for k = and k = , the results are zs = + + , zs = + + + these partition functions are the same as those of n = su and so, respectively. zs = zsu, zs = zso. for k = case gives zs = + + + + this is expected to be the same as zg the specialization of this partition function by x = y = agrees with the -bps partition function obtained from the general formula with {d, d} = {, } for g shown in table we can also compare this partition function to the partition function of the z gauging of the su sym. as is pointed out in the -bps partition function of the g sym is obtained from the su sym by the discrete gauging of z charge conjugation symmetry. this is also the case for the -bps partition function, and the -bps partition function of the g theory is given by zg =  zsu + zsu  . it is also possible to use the molien series to obtain the same partition function. we can directly conrm the agreement of and . zs = zg and means that zs and zs are related by the z discrete gauging. this is explicitly shown in the next subsection.","The text discusses the generalization of formulas for s-folds with k = 3, 4, 6 using oscillator representation. The theory on d-branes defines the Weyl group as the permutation group of n d-branes in the s-fold background.

The grand partition function is calculated by summing contributions from different sectors, determined by the invariance under specific operations.

"the discrete gauging is the prescription to obtain a new theory from a parent theory by gauging a discrete symmetry of the parent theory. it provides another way to construct n = theories . we remark that the gauging is dierent from the s-folding, and s-fold partition functions are not necessarily obtained from zu by a gauging. instead, the gaugings give additional relations among s-fold partition functions as we will show shortly. some of the relations below belong to the class of discrete gaugings associated with the principal extensions of the gauge groups, which are investigated in . as is pointed out in the s-fold theory s has a zp global sym- metry. let q be a divisor of p. we can gauge the subgroup zq zp to dene another theory. let us denote the new theory by s/zq. in terms of oscillator variables zq is generated by the rotation for a single oscillator with p replaced by p = p/q. this rotates the total wave function by the phase factor mp k , and the gauge invariance requires pm = mod k. as the result, the partition function of this theory is the same as that of s: zs/zq = zs. note that this relation is a reection of the coincidence of the moduli space, and does not mean the equivalence of the two theories. in general, the two theories are dierent theories that have dierent central charges. (for example, s/z is the o sym while s is the so sym.) the -bps partition function obtained by the restriction x = y = is z -bps s = pexp n x j= zjk + zn ! , and is consistent to the spectrum of coulomb branch operators given in . we can consider another type of discrete gaugings of s-fold theories that is generated by ( xi, yi, zi) for all oscillators. may be or may not be a divisor of k. if is a divisor of k this rotation is realized by repeating n times the rotation of a single oscillator, and this gauging is equivalent to the previous gauging with p = n mod k. we can describe the overall rotation of the all oscillators by the rotation of the fugacities ( x, y, z), and the partition function of the gauged theory is pzz, where z is the partition function before the zprojection and pzis the projection operator that eliminates terms that are not invariant under . this is in contrast to the s-fold projection in the large n limit in which the projection is carried out before the plethystic exponential. let us rst conrm if is a divisor of k reproduces with p given by . let rbe the operator replacing by ( x, y, z). if is a divisor of k the relation holds. namely, rizk m = m izk m . this relation means that tizk m is invariant under the zaction ( x, y, z; m t), and so is the plethystic exponential pexp  tizk m  . there- fore, the coecient of the tn term in the taylor expansion of pexp  tizk m  satises r  pexp  tizk m  tn  = mn pexp  tizk m  tn . the rinvariance requires mn = mod , and this is the same as the condition with p given by . by using we can prove the relation pzzs = zs, which we mentioned at the end of the previous subsection, as follows. first we divide the single particle partition function iz m into two parts; iz m = iz m + iz m+ with this decomposition we can rewrite the grand partition function as s = x m= pexp  tiz m  pexp  tiz m+  , and by picking up t terms we obtain zs = x m= x r= pexp  tiz m  tr pexp  tiz m+  tr . when we apply r the summand is rotated by the phase rm = r, and the corresponding projection pz leaves the terms with r = and r = we obtain pzzs = x m=  pexp  tiz m+  t + pexp  tiz m  t  = zs. this is the relation we wanted to show.","Discrete gauging involves obtaining a new theory by gauging a discrete symmetry of a parent theory, providing an alternative method to construct n = theories. Gauging differs from s-folding, with gaugings establishing additional relationships among s-fold partition functions. Different classes of discrete gaugings exist, such as those associated with principal extensions of gauge groups. Gauging the subgroup zq zp leads to defining a new theory denoted as s/zq, maintaining the same partition function as s but with different central charges. Various gaugings and rotations of oscillators can generate different theories, with certain rotations being equivalent to previous gaugings. Invariant terms under specific rotations are preserved in the partition function through projection operators. Mathematical relations and manipulations are utilized to demonstrate the equivalence or relationships between different theories and partition functions."
"in this section we reproduce the partition function by quantizing d- branes in s/zk. the analysis is quite similar to the analysis of sphere giants in . actually we can use the essential part of the calculation in as it is for our purpose. the analysis in starts from the bps brane conguration obtained by mikhailov . mikhailov showed that an arbitrary bps solution is given as the intersection of s dened by |x| + |y | + |z| = and a holomorphic surface f = we consider the taylor expansion f = x nx,ny,nz cnx,ny,nzxnxy nyznz, and treat the coecients cnx,ny,nz as dynamical variables. because the overall factor of f is irrelevant to the brane conguration the coecients are regarded as the projective coordinates of cp . due to the coupling of the d-brane to the background rr ux the wave function is not just a function but a section of the line bundle o over this conguration space. therefore, the quantization reduces to the simple problem to nd holomorphic sections of this line bundle. there are two issues which make the problem complicated. one is that dierent functions f may give the same brane conguration, and we should remove the redundancy. the other is that the surface f = may not intersect with s, and the parameter region giving such a surface should be removed from the conguration space. the detailed analysis in shows that even if we take account of these issues the result is the same as what we obtained by naive analysis neglecting these issues. let us assume that this is the case for the s-fold. then what we should additionally do is to impose the zk invariance to the surface f = this requires the function satisfy f( k x, ky, kz) = m k f, with some m zk. we identify m with the winding number of a d- brane around the non-trivial cycle in s/zk. this is easily shown as follows. we can deform the function f by continuously changing coecients to a simple function, say, f = zm, without violating the property . the resulting congutation obviously has the winding number m. because such a deformation does not change the homology class of the brane conguraion, an arbitrary brane conguration given by a function satisfying has winding number m. now, let us follow the quantization procedure of under the restric- tion . the conguration space is again cp with the homogeneous coordinates cnx,ny,nz. the constraint requires to satisfy nx + ny + nz = m mod k, and this is the same as . the wave function is a holomorphic section of the o line bundle over this conguration space, and is given by an order n homogeneous function of cnx,ny,nz. we can treat each of cnx,ny,nz as if it is a quantum with angular momentum = . then a quantum state of d-branes in s is regarded as a collection of n quanta, and the partition function of d-branes can be calculated as the partition function of states which include n quanta. let us introduce and t as fugacities for the angular momenta and the number of quanta n, respectively, and calculate the grand partition function. the contribution of a single quantum of cnx,ny,nz is txnxynyznz, and the grand partition function for a xed winding number m is pexp x nx,ny,nz txnxynyznz , where the sum is taken over non-negative integers satisfying . by summing up over m allowed by the discrete torsion, we obtain the grand partition function s in .","The text discusses the analysis of D3-branes in a specific configuration space. The quantization process involves finding holomorphic sections of a line bundle over the configuration space. Two main issues complicate the problem: redundancy of different functions giving the same brane configuration and some functions not intersecting with a defined surface. Despite these challenges, the analysis reveals consistent results with a naive approach. The analysis also involves imposing Zk invariance on the surface function, requiring it to satisfy a specific equation. By following the quantization procedure under this restriction, the grand partition function for D-branes in the configuration space can be calculated. The result is obtained by summing over different winding numbers allowed by discrete torsion."
"in this paper we derived the bps partition functions for arbitrary s-fold theories. we conrmed that the formula is consistent to the lie algebra isomorphisms. it is also consistent to the supersymmetry enhancement from n = to n = in rank and theories. namely, for s the partition function is the same as the u sym, and for s with k = , , the partition functions are the same as those of sym with g = su, so, and g, respectively. we also gave some relations among partition functions via discrete gaugings. the formula gives the partition function as the sum of contributions of sectors. from the holographic point of view, dierent sectors correspond to dierent winding numbers of d-branes around the non-trivial cycle in the internal space s/zk. we derived the same formula by quantizing d-branes in s/zk following the similar analysis of sphere giants . the derivation on the scft side is based on the harmonic oscillator description of bps operators. in the large n limit the sectors with wrapped branes decouple, and only the untwisted sector contributes to the partition function. each excited state of a harmonic oscillator can be regarded as a kk mode in s/zk. for nite n, this correspondence is not so obvious. in particular, the twisted sector gives a pfaan operator as a bound state of n harmonic oscillators. naively, this may be interpreted on the gravity side that a d-brane wrapped on the non-trivial cycle in s/zk is a bound state of kk modes satisfying the twisted boundary condition. however, it is not possible to impose the twisted boundary condition on kk modes due to the absence of gauge elds minimally coupling to gravitons. at present, unfortunately, we have no clear explanation how this is realized. it may be interesting to study the relation between the harmonic oscillator description and the quantization procedure of d-branes we used in section other than the bps partition function, there is another important quan- tity reecting the operator spectrum: the superconformal index. it has many connections to physical quantities. in particular, its schur limit (the schur index) are known to be related to the bps spectrum on the coulomb branch , d chiral algebra , and correlation functions in d topological qft . furthermore, there is an analytic formula for the schur index for u sym with an arbitrary n . it would be very interesting to inves- tigate the relation of our analysis to the superconformal index. acknowledgments we are grateful to t. mori for wonderful discussions. the work of s. f. was partially supported by advanced research center for quantum physics and nanoscience, tokyo institute of technology. the work of y. i. was par- tially supported by grand-in-aid for scientic research , ministry of education, science and culture, japan.","The paper discusses the derivation of BPS partition functions for arbitrary s-fold theories, confirming consistency with Lie algebra isomorphisms and supersymmetry enhancements.

"as we mentioned in the main text the bps partition function of an n = sym can be calculated by the molien series. in this appendix we show that the grand partition function for the unitary gauge groups is also obtained by using the molien series. let v be a d-dimensional vector space and g be an orbifold group acting on v . let vi be ane coordinates of v , and dij be the corresponding d d matrix representation of g. we consider the orbifold dened by the orbifold action vi v i = dijvj, g g. the coordinate ring of the orbifold v/g is spanned by polynomials of vi invariant under . let cn be the number of linearly independent g- invariant homogeneous polynomials of degree n. the generating function m = p n= cnzn is called the molien series, and given by the formula m = |g| x gg det). this formula can be applied to an arbitrary orbifold. in the following we conrm that the grand partition function u can also be derived by using this formula. let us rst consider -bps partition function. the coulomb branch moduli space cn/sn, and hence the -bps partition function of u sym should be obtained by applying the formula to this orbifold. namely, by taking the vector space v = cn and the orbifold group g = sn gives the -bps partition function z -bps u . because the summand takes the same value for permutations in the same class we can replace the summation over permutations g sn by the sum- mation over conjugacy classes with appropriate multiplicities inserted. we have zmolien u = x cn m n! det)), where cn is the family of conjugacy classes of sn, m is the number of elements in a conjugacy class cn, and g is a representative of . a conjugacy class is uniquely specied by the list of the lengths of cycles in g. let kj be the number of j-cycles in g. these satisfy x j= jkj = n, and the weight factor in is given by m n! = y j= jkjkj!. note that for a specic n only nite number of kj are non-vanishing due to the constraint . corresponding to the cycle decomposition, the matrix in zd) appearing in takes the block-diagonal form. each block corresponds to each cycle. the block associated with a j-cycle is ij = z z z z , and det ij = zj. therefore, we can rewrite as zmolien u = x {kj} y j= jkjkj! kj , where the sum is taken over {kj} satisfying . it is straightforward to extend the analysis above to the -bps partition function. we dene three copies of n-dimensional vector spaces vx, vy, vz corresponding to the three scalar elds and replace the vector space v by the direct product vx vy vz, and correspondingly replace d by i d. as the result, we obtain the molien series for the full moduli space cn/sn, which is given by with the factor /kj replaced by /kj. this is the -bps partition function with fugacities x = y = z. to obtain the partition function with generic fugacities we need to consider a renement of the molien series . it is dened by using diag d instead of zi d. namely, zmolien u = n! x gsn det d). by repeating the same procedure as above we obtain zmolien u = x {kj} y j= jkjkj!ikj, where i is the function dened in . to obtain the grand partition function, we multiply tn = q j=kj to . tnzmolien u = x {kj} y j= kj!

". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . introduction for generic classical and quantum spin chains the only conservation law is the energy, perhaps in addition one spin component . momentum conservation is destroyed by the underlying lattice and in thermal equilibrium the average currents vanish. one therefore expects that a local perturbation of the thermal state will spread diusively, a behavior which is actually ob- served in a large variety of systems, as prototypical examples we refer to . there are obvious exceptions such as integrable spin chains, for which a small perturbation induces a ballistic response. also, at least classically, at very low temperatures the harmonic approximation generally becomes valid, which then implies ballistic transport over a suitable time scale. the goal of our paper is to explain that, beyond the standard folklore, there can be a parameter regime, in which the dynamic correlations consist of a heat peak at the origin and in addition two sound peaks symmetrically moving to the right and left. these peaks broaden sub-ballistically but faster than diusion. the theoretical argument is based on nonlinear uctuating hy- drodynamics , which refers to long wavelength behavior and should thus be equally valid for both classical and quantum chains. for quantum chains, because of numerical limitations, it is dicult to pin down the phenomenon, even less so the precise scaling form. in this contribution we thus restrict our study to classical spin chains of xxz type. we note that for o-lattice mod- els, where there is momentum conservation , nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain the presence of sound peaks with anomalous scaling has been observed in sev- eral recent studies and is well understood within the framework of nfh . the results presented here for the xxz model bear close resemblance to those seen for the rotor model, where early results in indicated a diusive to super-diusive transport, and has recently been understood in the framework of nfh . it should also be noted that there are no phase transitions , rather the anomalous scaling is observed over very long transient time-scales. for our argument we require that the anisotropy parameter = |jz/jx| = |jz/jy|, where jz is the nearest neighbor coupling between z-components of spin and jx = jy between the x or y-components respectively, satises < then, at high temperatures, energy and the z-component of the spin diuse. however at low temperatures the spin motion is conned to a plane orthogonal to the z-axis and phase dierences between neighboring spins are small. to achieve dierences of order ( in other words phase slips or, equivalently, umklapp) is an activated process and is thus strongly thermally suppressed in a low temperature regime. in this regime, the phase dierences are an almost conserved eld, so there is a broad range of time scales where this conservation law dictates the hydrodynamics. under such conditions, nonlinear uctuating hydrodynamics can be applied. the theory predicts the dynamical correlations contain a central non-propagating heat peak and left- and right- moving sound peaks. the three peaks broaden as nontrivial powers of time according to characteristic explicitly known scaling functions . to illustrate the dierence between sound peaks and ballistic broadening, we also simulate the integrable spin chain of fadeev and takhtajan . the innite number of conservation laws then leads to a structured scaling function which scales self-similarly as tf. there has been previous work on non-integrable classical models (and their kpz connection) such as the fermi-pasta-ulam chain , the discrete nonlin- ear schr odinger equation , coupled rotors , and one-dimensional hard-point systems . however, to our knowledge the present paper is the rst exploration of nfh in classical spin chains. high-temperature, non-integrable and integrable lattice landau-lifshitz equations lll equations we consider spins of unit length on the one-dimensional lattice, sj = (sx j , sy j , sz j ) with |sj| = , j z. the standard lll interaction is quadratic in the spins with hamiltonian h = x jz  sx j sx j+ + sy j sy j+ + sz j sz j+  , the asymmetry parameter, the lll equations of motion then read d dtsj = {sj, h} = sj bj, bj = sjh, avijit das et al. where the poisson bracket between two functions, g, g, of the spin variables is dened by {g, g} = p j  g/s j  g/s j  s j with the usual summa- tion convention. clearly |sj| = for all times. the hamiltonian character of the dynamics can be seen also by introducing the position-like angular vari- able j s and the conjugate canonical momentum-like variable sj dened through sx j = f cos j, sy j = f sin j, sz j = sj, where f = / indeed, one checks that {si, j} = ij, {i, j} = , {si, sj} = in these variables the hamiltonian reads h = x jz  ff cos + sjsj+  . thus at low energies the phases tend to align, while sets the interactions between the z components. the isotropic model corresponds to = , easy- plane to < , and easy-axis to > in the new variables the equations of motion become d dtj = f f cos ff cos , d dtsj = ff sin ff sin. for |sj| < the angle j is dened modulo for sj = the angle j is ill-dened. however, in our context, trajectories where a spin precisely hits either the north or south pole of the unit sphere | = ) have measure zero and therefore can be ignored. the s-s interaction could have additional contributions. one example is the ionic potential p j s j . many of our results are valid in greater generality, but we explore the simplest case . the lll dynamics has two locally conserved elds, namely the z-component of the spin, sj, and the energy ej = ff cos sjsj+, where for convenience we have introduced the phase dierence rj = j+ j. from the equations of motion one deduces the form of the spin current, j s j , and energy current, j e j , as j s j = ff sin, j e j = fff f sin + ffsj sin + ffsj+ sin. high-temperature diusive regime we rst assume that there are no further conservation laws. the equilibrium gibbs measures are then given by the two-parameter family zn exp

innite volume equilibrium averages will be denoted by ,h. we note that the hamiltonian is even and the currents are odd in rj. hence j s j ,h = , j e j ,h = but then also their derivatives with respect to , h vanish and, using the deni- tion of the drude weight given in , one concludes that both drude weights are zero. thus the conventional expectation is to have a diusive spreading of the equilibrium time-correlations for spin and energy. since they have opposite signature under time reversal, the cross diusion coecient should vanish. to conrm, we performed molecular dynamics simulations at inverse tem- perature = in fig. we show numerical results for the spin and energy correlations dened by css = sjsc ,h, cee = ejec ,h fig. plots of cab for xxz easy plane regime at high

avijit das et al. where . . . c ,h denotes the connected correlation dened as qjqc eq := qeq) qeq)eq. these simulations are for system size n = and were run up to time t = . we see that spin and energy autocorrelations indeed show diusive behavior, while there are no cross correlations. the novelty of our contribution is to establish that at lower temperatures the dynamical properties change dramatically through the appearance of bal- listic sound propagation. but before embarking on that discussion we use the opportunity to illustrate that equilibrium time-correlations for an integrable spin-chain are dominated by a broad ballistic spreading, in contrast to the sub-ballistic broadening of the two sound peaks in the case of a nonintegrable chain. the form of dynamical correlations in classical integrable models have been discussed in several earlier work including for the toda chain and in for a particular integrable spin chain, which we will now discuss. integrable lll model faddeev and takhtajan discovered an inte- grable version of the lll model, which still has nearest neighbor coupling but fig. plots of cab for the integrable lll model in easy plane regime at high tem- perature at dierent times. parameters are = , = and n = the energy and spin are uncorrelated. energy correlation reaches the boundary of the system faster than the spin correlation. from the maxima of the peaks, the estimated speed is for the spin mode, whereas it is for the energy mode. scaling plots are shown in fig. . nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain

integrable classical spin chain. easy plane corresponds to > , while in the limit one recovers the isotropic interaction h = log   + s s . the innitely extended faddeev-takhtajan spin chain has a countable number of locally conserved elds, which are constructed by successive dierentiations of the r-matrix, see . here we focus on the z-component of the magnetization, sj, and the local energy, ej, as the rst items in the list of conservation laws. we display their time-correlations at = with inverse temperature = and magnetic eld h = , see fig. . in the scaling plot fig. , we see that the energy and spin correlations show good ballistic scaling already at short times. in simulations of the spin current correlations are reported at parameters = , = , h = without losing integrability, the hamiltonian can be analytically continued to purely imaginary , which amounts to replace the trigonometric functions by their hyperbolic cousin . physically this corresponds to easy- axis regime. we refer to the discussions in , also reporting on parameters with diusive spreading. avijit das et al. fig. easy axis data = , = , n = we observe perfect diusive behaviour . easy plane at low-temperatures low-temperature eective hamiltonian we now return to the nonin- tegrable xxz spin chain. as the temperature is lowered, if we impose easy-axis anisotropy, > , the spreading of spin and energy correlations is still diu- sive, as conrmed by further molecular dynamics simulations. in fig. we show the easy axis data. apparently diusion still holds at = , although with slow convergence . however, for easy-plane, < , phase dierences become locally almost conserved, which drastically changes the dynamical be- havior, as will now be explained in detail. the equations of motion are given by . phase dierences are dened through rj = j+ j , mod , where we choose coordinates such that rj . rj = corresponds to j = j+ which is the minimum of the cosine-potential. the dynamics of the rjs has the following generic structure. one starts from their extended version with rj r governed by d dt rj = gj gj+ nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain for a given collection of smooth functions {gj, j z}. the restriction to the unit circle s is achieved by setting rj = rj + nj with nj the integer winding number for bond j; we may choose nj = , while rj is a smooth function on s by construction the rjs have the form of a local conservation law, which in integrated version reads x j   rj rj  = x j z t ds  gj gj+  = , for a system with periodic boundary conditions. on the other hand, x j  rj rj  = x j nj . hence rj is locally conserved only if the total winding number remains constant: p j nj = the dynamical events rj = are the phase slip processes where the winding number changes. thus the eld of phase dierences rj is locally conserved only until the rst phase slip event. however, as we show in fig. , at low temperatures most phase slip events come in closely-spaced pairs with no change in the total winding number, so the coarse-grained dynamics actually respects this conservation law until one has unpaired phase slip events. as illustrated in fig. and , for high temperatures there are lots of phase slips. however for easy-plane and low enough temperatures the z- component is approximately constant and the phase dierence is trapped by the cosine-potential. then phase slips are very much suppressed, see fig. and . therefore, there is an emergence of an approximately conserved quantity. in other words, phase slips are thermally activated process which, in a low-temperature regime, can safely be ignored on the time scales reached by our simulation and, in fact, much longer. phase dierences are thus approxi- mately conserved in this regime. let us rst attempt a rough estimate for the presence of a third conser- vation law. we assume constant rj = r and sj = s. adding also an external eld, h, the energy of this conguration equals eg = cos r s hs. its minimum is located at r = , s = h/ and we require |h| < to ensure that the minimum lies inside {|s| < }. let us compute the energy required for a phase slip event caused by motion of a single spin. for the case where s remains xed but r changes to , the energy barrier eslip can be easily computed and leads to eslip =   h > avijit das et al. on the other hand for the case where the angle r remains xed and the spin moves to the north pole , the energy barrier is eslip =   h h  . we expect phase slips to occur at a rate eeslip where is the inverse temperature, and so eslip > could be a rough criterion for small number of phase-slips and a new approximate conservation law. in fig. we show space-time plots showing phase-slip events seen in simulations at high temperature , zero magnetic eld, high temperature , nite magnetic eld , low temperature , zero magnetic eld and low temperature , nite magnetic eld with parameters = /, n = in fig. , we show the dependence of average total number of observed phase slips on the inverse temperature up to t = seen in the low temperature simulations . we see that eslip takes the values and from the two energy estimates mentioned above. from the simulations we nd the expected activated dependence form, however with a barrier e . to understand such behavior we have to investigate in more detail the actual process of phase slips. let us consider the spin chain with zero external magnetic eld and in the easy-plane regime fig. phase slip events at = , h = , = , h = , = , h = and = , h = in easy plane regime with = . it shows that the phase slip events become rare with decreasing temperature and decreasing external magnetic eld. red boxes indicate sites where phase slips occur, i.e, nj is + ). nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain fig. the gure illustrates that the aver- age number of phase slip events decays ex- ponentially with . the parameters are h = , = , n = , t = , ini- tial states. inset shows the same plot in log scale. in log scale the slope is - which is consistent with our theoretical estimation within error bars. . in the ground state all spins are aligned and lying on the xy plane. we are interested in nding the minimum-energy spin conguration in which there is a phase slip. what we nd at the lowest temperatures where such phase slip events do happen in our simulations is that the phase slip event is centered on a single spin j that moves out of the xy plane and is very close to either j = or j = . the nearby spins i move to near the conguration of their angles i that minimizes the energy given the special orientation of the one central spin j, with all spins except the central one oriented near the same i. when we do this minimization for = and h = , the resulting minimum energy of the phase slip event is eslip = . as expected, the measured density of phase slip events shows a thermally activated dependence on temperature as exp, as shown in fig. . these phase slip events are produced at this low density by the chaotic equilibrium dynamics of the lll chain. to work with an almost conserved eld is somewhat vague and it is more convenient to modify the dynamics such that rj is strictly locally conserved. of course, this is a valid approximation only in a regime with a very low density of phase slips. we rewrite our hamiltonian in a slightly more general form as hlt = x jz  ffu sjsj+  . if one would set u = cos, included to have motion on s, then hlt = h. to suppress phase slips entirely we modify u by adding innitely high potential barriers at x = . then up to the rst phase slip event, the dynamics generated by h agrees with the dynamics generated by hlt, but they dier later on. actually, for what we want to show the precise shape of the potential barriers plays no role, as long as phase slips are forbidden. nonlinear uctuating hydrodynamics in the low temper- ature regime as before, the hamiltonian equations of motions for are d dtj = sjhlt, d dtsj = jhlt. avijit das et al. the conserved elds are phase dierence, spin, and energy, rj, sj, ej = fjfj+uj sjsj+, where for later convenience we introduced the shorthands fj = f and uj = u. from the equations of motion we obtain for the current of the phase dierence, j r j = f jfj+uj fjf juj + , for the spin current, j s j = fjfju j, and for the energy current, j e j = fjfjf jfj+  u juj+uju j  +  fjfju jsj++fjfj+u jsj  . the grand canonical ensemble of hlt for a nite system with n lattice sites and periodic boundary conditions is given by zn exp h  hlt n x j= rj h n x j= sj i n y j= drjdsj with the normalizing partition function zn = z n exp h  hlt n x j= rj h n x j= sj i n y j= drjdsj, where is the chemical potential for the additional conserved eld rj. in- nite volume averages with respect to are denoted by ,h,. the canon- ical free energy is dened as f = lim n n log zn. the innite volume equilibrium averages of rj, sj, ej are r = rj,h, = f, s = sj,h, = hf, e = ej,h, = ) + r + hs, independent of j because of translation invariance. by convexity of f, these relations dene the inverse mapping , h, ). under the constraints the lll equilibrium time-correlations of sj, ej should be well approximated by the same time-correlations as computed from the dynamics governed by hlt. but hlt is just one particular anharmonic chain and, as explained in , the time-correlations can be predicted from nonlinear uctuating hydrodynamics. we do not repeat here the details, but merely point out that in normal mode representation one arrives at a three- component uctuating eld, =  , ,  . the euler nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain currents have to be expanded to second order, which in approximation then leads to the coupled langevin equations t + x = here d is a constant diusion matrix and b is gaussian white noise, both related through uctuation-dissipation as bbt = d. this part of the equation is a phenomenological ansatz for the eective noise and dissipation produced by the deterministic chaos. however the sound speed, c, and the three symmetric coupling matrices g have to be computed from the underly- ing microscopic model. in particular g determines the dynamical universality class. fortunately, for the lll chain the magic identity j j ,h, = (j r j , j s j , j e j ),h, = is available. using this property the precise form of g and its relation to second derivatives of the free energy have been established in . we turn to the proof of . for the phase dierence current we obtain j r j ,h, = f jfj+uj fjf juj + ,h, = z n z  sjehlt e p j rj+h p j sj = h. correspondingly, for the spin current we obtain j s j ,h, = fjfju j,h, = z n z fjfj  rjehlt e p j rj+h p j sj = , where we used partial integration in the last step. for the energy current there are more terms to be considered, j e j ,h, = fjfjf jfj+  u juj + uju j  +  fjfju jsj+ + fjfj+u jsj  ,h, = z n z h f jfj+uj sj+  rjehlt +  fjf juj sj  rjehlt i e p j rj+h p j sj = z n z h fjf juj + f jfj+uj i e(hlt p j rjh p j sj) = h. avijit das et al. we conclude that the hlt-currents satisfy independently of u, pro- vided u diverges suciently fast at the two border points so as to have the boundary terms vanish. when applying the magic identity, the potential u is specied as the cosine with innitely high barriers added at x = . this does not change the free energy. thus at the end the coupling matrix g is given in terms of the lll free energy. we refer to appendix a for more details. the chemical potential is not a physical control parameter that we will explore. it is needed in the second order expansion, but will be set to = afterwards. numerical results at low temperature we now present numerical results for the dynamical correlations for two cases with nite magnetic eld and zero eld, at inverse temperature = apart from the spin and energy correlations dened in eq. we now measure crr = rjrc ,h, corresponding to the extra conserved variable. we also compute the normal mode correlations c,, where , = +, , correspond to the modes +, , respectively. fig. parameters: = , = , h = , n = rk- with dt = : plot of cab at dierent times. nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain simulation details: in the simulations we rst generated equilibrium cong- urations corresponding to the canonical distribution, specied by , h, using a metropolis monte carlo algorithm. the equilibrated conguration was then evolved with our hamiltonian dynamics using either a xed step size and sometimes an adaptive step size th order runge-kutta integrator. this maintains the global conservations up to an absolute deviation of and respectively until the nal time of evolution. individual spin lengths are also conserved up to averages were compute over around initial conditions. in all our simulations we xed = at much smaller temperatures, phase slips would be even rarer but the dynamics of small uctuations about the ordered state is expected to be closer to integrable, and the time required to see the asymptotic scaling becomes inaccessible. case-i : in this regime we expect to conrm the kpz sound modes and levy heat modes as predicted by nfh. we have chosen the following parameters: = , = , n =

dynamics in this section we discuss a discrete version of the lattice landau-lifshitz equations, using an integration algorithm that explicitly preserves the total angular momentum and the total energy of the system to machine precision independent of the time step used in the numerical integration, while allowing a bounded error in the xed-length constraint on each classical spin (in the anisotropic case with = , it is of course only the z component of the angular momentum which is thus conserved). as will be apparent from the description nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain below, the smallness of the violation of the xed-length constraint for each spin is controlled by the size of the time-step used in the numerical integration. additionally, this error does not grow with the total time over which the system is evolved. since all our general arguments and theoretical analysis rely heavily on the existence of a conserved energy and angular momentum density, and the xed-length constraint on each individual classical spin does not play a similar central role in the theoretical analysis, our procedure allows us to use relatively large time-steps while preserving the universality class of the dynamics to machine precision. our procedure may be viewed as a modication of the so-called odd-even dynamics that has been employed previously in the literature . in the odd- even decomposition, one splits the time-evolution into two steps, one of which sets in motion all the odd spins, allowing them to precess in the exchange eld supplied by the static even spins, while the other step reverses the role of even and odd spins to evolve the even spins. below we refer to these individual steps as odd and even precessions. our modication is suggested by a particular approximation (the cayley approximation) to the evolution operators that implement these even or odd precessions over a small time in a way that preserves the orthogonal nature of the evolution operator. consider eqn. with j odd and all bj held xed . with all bj xed, the right hand side is a bj dependent rotation of all the odd spins. let us denote the corresponding linear operator by ro (where o stands for odd and the subscript e on b reminds us that b depends on the current conguration of all even spins, held xed for the duration of this step). here ro and re are antisymmetric matrices that serve as the generators of the corresponding rotations. the odd spins after a time can be obtained by applying the operator exp to the initial conguration of odd spins. we begin with the cayley approximation to individual precessions, exp ( ro)( + ro), and similarly for re. with this in hand, we dene the operator o =  + re   ro  . here, we have explicitly displayed the dependence of ro on be in the conguration on which the operator acts. let us schematically denote the conguration of odd spins after the action of the rst term by s/ o . the second term is a rst order approximation to the precession of even spins in the exchange eld provided by s/ o , starting with the initial conguration of even spins, denoted schematically by s e. now, the rst term amounts to precessing odd spins backwards in time , using the exchange eld provided by the conguration s e, but starting with avijit das et al. the conguration s/ o in order to end up nally with the initial conguration s o of the odd spins. as a result, it is easy to see that o explicitly preserves both the total angular momentum and the total energy of the system, independently of the value of . however, o is not orthogonal. o dened as o =  + ro   re  has the same properties. next we note that the product oo provides a second order accurate approximation to the actual spin dynamics. this approximation preserves the total angular momentum and total energy independently of , while preserving the xed-length constraint on each spin only to second order. additionally, our numerical tests reveal that the violation of the xed length constraint does not grow with total time of integration if each time step is implemented by the operator oo, even for relatively large values of . - - - - x e- css t= t= t= t= t= - - - - x e- e- e- e- cee t= t= t= t= t= fig. results from discrete dynamics with dt = : plot of css and cee for parameters = , h = , n = at ve dierent

it in easy-plane regimes. we are mostly con- cerned with the basic conserved quantities energy and magnetization in both models at dierent regimes of model pa- rameters and external parameters like temperature and magnetic eld. for the lll model, being non-integrable, these two are the only known conserved avijit das et al. - - - - x css t= t= t= t= t= - - - - x e- e- e- e- e- e- e- cee t= t= t=

have put this into the framework of nfh to get some predictions about the dynamical scaling. we have shown that the non- integrable xxz chain in the easy-plane regime displays diusive behaviour at high temperatures, and sound modes with kpz broadening at low tempera- tures. the integrable spin chain however demonstrates ballistic behaviour in nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for the classical xxz spin chain the easy plane regime. we also nd that at high temperature the easy-axis nonintegrable case gives us perfectly diusive behavior. our various results are summarized in table for the heat mode, while nfh predicts anoma- lous levy broadening, we have not been able to clearly observe this yet in the simulations. it is possible that one requires larger system sizes and longer times to observe this and further studies are necessary. similar problems re- lated to non-observation of the expected asymptotic behaviour, due to possible nite size or nite time eects, have been reported in other recent transport studies , and understanding their origins is an open problem. table summary of the transport properties observed in this work. model and the parameter regime

Researchers study permutations that avoid a specific pattern q.

The text also raises interesting questions regarding pattern avoidance in permutations."
"the vast and prolic area of permutation patterns considers permutations as linear orders. in this concept, a permutation p is a linear array pp pn of the rst n positive integers in some order, so that each integer occurs exactly once. we say that a permutation p contains the pattern q = qq qk if there is a k-element set of indices i < i < < ik so that pir < pis if and only if qr < qs. if p does not contain q, then we say that p avoids q. a recent survey on permutation patterns can be found in and a book on the subject is . this denition does not consider the other perspective from which permutations can be studied, namely that of the symmetric group, where the product of two permutations is de- ned, and the notion of a permutations inverse is dened. therefore, it is not surprising that pattern avoidance questions become much more difcult if the symmetric group concept is present in them. one exception to this is the straightforward observation that if p avoids q, then its inverse permutation p avoids q key words and phrases. cycles, permutation pattern, permutation squares ams subject classications. a, a trying to extend that simple observation at least a little bit, in this paper we study the following family of questions. let us call a permutation p strongly q-avoiding if both p and p avoid q. let savn denote the number of strongly q-avoiding permutations of length n. what can be said about the numbers savn? as far as we know, this is the rst time that questions of this type are considered, that is, when one attempts to enumerate permutations p so that both p and p are to avoid the same pattern q. in section , we will prove that if q is a monotone increasing pattern of any length, then savn = will hold for n sufciently large. this is only true for monotone increasing patterns. then in section , we will provide an explicit formula for the generating function for the sequence of numbers savn = savn, while in section , we will prove a lower bound for the sequence savn. finally, in section , we end the paper with intriguing questions about the sequences savn = savn. the pattern k in this section, we prove that for all k, if p is long enough, then either p or p must contain an increasing subsequence of length k. theorem . let k be a positive integer, and let n + then savn = proof. let p be a permutation of length n + that avoids the pattern k. then p is the union of k decreasing subsequences. color these subsequences with colors , , . . . , k so that a maximum-length subsequence gets the color then there are at least + entries of color let us say that these entries are in positions i < i < < im, and they are p > p > > p. in order to simplify notation, let pj = p. now consider the m + positions pm < pm < < p in p. by the pigeon- hole principle, there will be a set s of at least k positions among them so that entries in these positions are of the same color, that is, that form a decreasing subsequence s. then we claim that those same k entries form an increasing sequence in p indeed, let positions pa and pb contain two entries of s, with a < b, so pa > pb. that means that position p contains a smaller entry than position p, that is, p) < p). this argument can be repeated for every pair of entries in positions that belong to s, proving that in p, the k entries that are in positions in s form an increasing subsequence. the bound on the length of n relative to k for a strongly k-avoiding permutation given above is tight for at least small values of k. this is trivially true for k = , moreover, we are going to present a strongly k-avoiding permutation of length for each of k = , , , in these cases, the strategy is to create p such that p will be a be a specic layered permutation, that is, it will consist of k decreasing subsequences of length so that the entries decrease within each layer, but increase from one layer to the next. as layered permutations are involutions, this means each p has order four. further since p = p and the inverse of the identity permutation is itself, we also have p avoiding k in these examples. however, nding a good p (one that avoids k while producing the desired p) makes the construction challenging. indeed, for k = , let p = = , then we have p = a similar approach yields a maximum length strongly k-avoiding permutation of length for k = : p = p = somewhat similarly constructed strongly k-avoiding permutations of length also exist for k = , for k = , each of the four intervals of consecutive entries is of the form: = . from left to right, each interval is made up of the largest remaining entries. for k = , the ve intervals are of the form: that is, . from left to right, each interval is made up of the largest remaining entries. there are also nice graphical symmetries within the intervals in these small examples. as such, there is reason to believe it could be possible to generalize these constructions to show the bound given in theorem is always the best. conjecture . let k be a positive integer, and let n = then savn = we have not formulated a conjecture as to how many such maximal length permutations strongly avoid k. our example is not unique for k = and (for example also strongly avoids ), but we have not investigated this for larger values of k. furthermore, if p is layered, and p is strongly k-avoiding, then, as we pointed out, p = p is also k-avoiding. our constructions for k are examples for this. note that no other patterns q have the property that savn = if q is large enough. in- deed, the identity permutation strongly avoids all patterns that are not monotone increasing.","The text introduces the concept of permutation patterns, where permutations are viewed as linear orders and defined as arrays of positive integers. It discusses pattern containment and avoidance, particularly focusing on strongly avoiding a specific pattern. The section outlines the enumeration of strongly q-avoiding permutations and presents results for monotone increasing patterns. It provides proofs for the enumeration, generating functions, and lower bounds for these permutations. Additionally, it explores examples of strongly avoiding permutations for specific patterns, demonstrating construction techniques and tightness of bounds.

"in a -avoiding permutation, all entries on the left of the entry must be smaller than all entries on the right of , or a -pattern would be formed with the entry in the middle. therefore, if p = pp pn is a -avoiding permutation, and pi = , then p maps the interval into itself, and the interval into itself. that means that p will be strongly -avoiding if and only if its restrictions to those two intervals are strongly -avoiding. in other words, each non-empty strongly -avoiding permutation p uniquely decomposes as p = lr, where l is a strongly -avoiding permutation ending in the entry , and r is a strongly -avoiding permutation ). sometimes, this is described by writing that p = l r, and saying that p is the direct sum of l and r. therefore, if sav = p n savnzn, and b is the ordinary generating function for the number of strongly -avoiding permutations ending in , then the equality sav = + bsav, holds. this motivates our analysis of strongly -avoiding permutations that end in the entry","In a -avoiding permutation, entries on the left of an entry must be smaller than entries on the right to avoid forming a -pattern in the middle. A -avoiding permutation can be strongly -avoiding if the restrictions to certain intervals are also strongly -avoiding.

By analyzing strongly -avoiding permutations ending in a specific entry, it can be represented as a direct sum of l and r. The equality sav = + bsav highlights the relationship between strongly -avoiding permutations and their generating functions."
"our goal in this section is to prove the following theorem that characterizes strongly - avoiding permutations that end in theorem . for any permutation p ending in , the following two statements are equivalent. the permutation p is strongly -avoiding. the permutation p has form p = n k where k n . that is, p is unimodal beginning with its n k n largest entries in increasing order followed by the remaining k smallest entries in decreasing order. we will prove this theorem through a sequence of lemmas. in this section, we will assume p is a permutation of length n ending in its entry first, we will show that strongly - avoiding permutations must end in a long decreasing subsequence. lemma . let p = pp pn be a strongly -avoiding permutation. if n , then pn = proof. suppose by way of contradiction that pi = where i = n then, because p must avoid , we know that pa < pk if a i < k < n. specically, p < pk if i < k < n. hence pi+j = n for some positive integer j. now consider p note rst p = and p = p there are at least + = n i entries all of which are larger than p however, there are at most n + = n i positions between and p in p hence at least one of these large entries appears before the which creates the forbidden pattern in p remark . when n appears in a strongly -avoiding permutation p, the entries that follow n must be in decreasing order to avoid a pattern in p. we now extend lemma to show a strongly -avoiding permutation p must end in a consecutive decreasing sequence of length at least n . lemma . let p = pp pn be a strongly -avoiding permutation ending in the smallest n entries of p appear in the last n positions in decreasing order. proof. by way of contradiction, let us assume that p is a strongly -avoiding permutation, and let us also assume that the longest decreasing subsequence at the end of p that consists of consecutive integers in consecutive positions starts with the entry m < n . so m + is the smallest entry where p deviates from the described form. then if pi = m+, we have i nm as with lemma , the entries p, p, . . . , pi must all be smaller than the entries pi+, pi+, . . . , pnm, and in particular pi+j = n for some positive integer j. we now consider p note rst p = notice p = pm+ if i < m + , then pm+ > p since pm+ appears to the right of m + and m + < n m + so pm+ is not part of our descending sequence of small entries. this means ppp form a -pattern in p otherwise, i m + then p = i + for some r < i. that is, one of the entries to the left of m + in p maps to the position of a larger element to the right of m + in p. hence, ppp form a pattern in p thus every strongly -avoiding permutation p must end with a consecutive decreasing sequence of at least half of its smallest entries. next, we show that except for the monotone decreasing permutation, all strongly - avoiding permutations p begin with an ascent. lemma . if p is a strongly -avoiding permutation ending in , and p begins with a descent, then p is the decreasing permutation n proof. suppose that p does begin with a descent, that is, suppose p > p then, rst notice if p = n, then in p, we have n appearing somewhere in the rst n positions. however, then n with the last two entries p, p form a -pattern in p hence if p begins with a descent, then p = n. now, as mentioned in remark , all subsequent entries must appear in descending order to avoid a -pattern in p. by lemma , we know that a strongly -avoiding permutation p that ends in ends with at least a half of its smallest entries forming a decreasing subsequence of consecutive entries. we now extend this to complete our proof that p must have the unimodal structure described in theorem be a strongly -avoiding permutation. lemma . a strongly -avoiding permutation p ending in its entry must be of the form p = n k proof. let k be the length of the longest consecutive decreasing sequence at the end of p. now consider the large entries k + , k + , . . . , n. if p does not satisfy the structure, then at least two of these large entries must form a descent. of all these descents, choose the descent pipi+ such that pi+ is the smallest. we rst note that not only must these large entries of p avoid , they must also avoid forming a pattern in p. this is since the large entries appear in the rst n positions in p and the entries corresponding to those positions are in decreasing order in p by lemma . hence a of large entries in p would form a pattern in p similarly, the large entries must avoid forming a in p. if there was such a pattern, say papbpc, the entries in these position in p, namely p ap bp c form a pattern. thus all of p, p, . . . , pi must be larger than pi+ as a smaller such entry along with entries pi, pi+ would form pattern in p. consider the entry pi+ first note pi+ must be one of the large entries since pi+ < pj for all j i, and so pi+ being part of the long decreasing sequence at the end of p would mean pi+ is part of it as well. thus pi+ > pi+ by the minimality constraint on the chosen descent. however, this forces pipi+pi+ to form a or a among the large entries of p, both of which are not allowed. hence if p is a strongly -avoiding permutation, it must be of the form p = n k to complete the proof of theorem , we show these conditions are not only necessary, but also sufcient. proposition . let k n . then any permutation p = n k is a strongly -avoiding permutation. proof. it is clear that p does not contain a pattern. calculating p, we see that it is com- posed of the following three parts: the rst n k entries will be , . . . , , , respectively. the next k = k n entries correspond to entries with values and positions k, , . . . , n k + in p. because the order of these entries is monotone decreasing in p, these entries will be in increasing order in p the last n k entries will reverse the order of the rst n k entries in p. that is, the last n k entries of p are n, , . . . , . hence p = k n , a concatenation of three blocks of monotone sequences in increasing order. thus p avoids as well. as such, p is a strongly -avoiding permutation.","The section focuses on proving a theorem that characterizes strongly-avoiding permutations that end in 1. It states that a permutation is strongly-avoiding if and only if it follows a specific unimodal structure. The text provides lemmas and proofs to support this theorem, showing that strongly-avoiding permutations must end in a long decreasing subsequence and a consecutive decreasing sequence. It also demonstrates that, except for monotone decreasing permutations, all strongly-avoiding permutations start with an ascent. The section concludes by proving the theorem that a strongly-avoiding permutation ending in 1 must have a specific form, and that any permutation following this form is strongly-avoiding."
"rearranging , we get the equality sav = b. it follows from theorem that there are n strongly -avoiding permutations of length n and ending in if n , and there is one such permutation if n = therefore, b = z + z = z z + z so yields sav = z + z + z z z + z + z so in particular, sav is rational. its root of smallest modulus is about , so the exponential growth rate of the sequence of the numbers sav is the reciprocal of that root, or about . the rst few elements of the sequence, starting with n = , are , , , , , , , , , interestingly, the sequence is in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences as se- quence a, where it is mentioned in connection to work in quantum mechanics .","The text discusses the enumeration of strongly-avoiding permutations of length n, with n variations and outcomes.

The sequence is related to quantum mechanics and is listed in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences as sequence ""a."""
"as the pattern is the inverse of , it is straightforward to see that p is strongly - avoiding if and only if p is strongly -avoiding. therefore, sav = sav for all n. similarly, for any pattern q, we have the equality savq = savq for all n. the following result, while similar in avor, is a little bit less obvious. proposition . let q be any pattern, and let q denote the reverse complement of q. then savq = savq for all positive integers n. proof. let p be a permutation of length n, and let r denote the involution . let us multiply permutations left to right. then pr is the reverse of p, while rp is the complement of p. note that r = r, showing why it does not matter in which order we take the reverse and the complement of a permutation. now the square of the reverse complement of p is = rprrpr = rpr, since r is an involution, so r is the identity. on the other hand, rpr is also the reverse complement of p if p is strongly q-avoiding, then in particular, p is q-avoiding, so the reverse complement p of p avoids q. furthermore, p avoids q, so the reverse complement of p, which we just proved is also the square of the reverse complement of p also avoids q. so p is strongly q-avoiding. note that taking the reverse complement of p corresponds to rotating the permutation matrix of p by degrees, and that rotation commutes with matrix multiplication in the sense that ab = , where denotes the degree rotation. that implies that p and p avoid q, if and only if p and avoid q. as a consequence, sav = sav for all n. this provides some additional motiva- tion to compute the numbers sav we will discuss that very difcult task in section","Equivalent patterns are discussed in this section, highlighting the relationship between strongly avoiding and avoiding patterns. It is shown that for a pattern p, it is strongly -avoiding if and only if p is strongly -avoiding. Additionally, the reverse complement of a pattern q is explored, with the proposition that savq equals savq for all positive integers n. The concept of an involution is introduced to demonstrate the interplay between reverse and complement operations on permutations. The section concludes by connecting rotation of permutation matrices with pattern avoidance, emphasizing the importance of computing the numbers sav."
"it is straightforward to prove a lower bound for the numbers sav that shows that for large n, the inequality sav > sav holds. indeed, let us call a permutation p = pp pn block-cyclic if it has both of the following properties. it is possible to cut p into blocks b, b, . . . , bt of entries in consecutive positions so that for all i < j, the block bi is on the left of the block bj, and each entry in bi is smaller than each entry in bj. each block is either a singleton, or its entries can be written in one-line notation as , for some integers < i k. that is, each block is a singleton or a power of the cycle that is not the identity. example . the following are all block-cyclic (the bars are indicating the border between blocks). p = |||, p = ||, p = |||| note that each block-cyclic permutation is -avoiding. furthermore, any power of a block-cyclic permutation is block-cyclic, and so it is also -avoiding. therefore, block- cyclic permutations are all -avoiding. let hn be the number of block-cyclic permutations of length n, and let h = p n hnzn. the number of allowed blocks of size k is if k = , and k if k > , leading to the formula h = z p kzk = z z = z + z z . the singularity of smallest modulus of the denominator is about , so the expo- nential growth rate of the sequence hn is the reciprocal of that number, or about . as hn sav for all n, we have proved the following. corollary . the inequality lim sup n n p sav holds. note that this proves that for large n, there are more permutations so that all their powers avoid than permutations so that just they and their square avoids it is possible to improve this lower bound with more complicated constructions, but we have no conjecture as to what the actual growth rate of the sequence sav is.","For large n, the inequality sav > sav holds for block-cyclic permutations, which are all -avoiding. The number of block-cyclic permutations of length n is denoted as hn, and the formula for h is given as z + z z .

"in the past decades, local feature description has drawn inten- sive attention in various applications, such as image retrieval , image matching , object search and face recognition . although the deep learning based cnn approaches are emerging in recent years and have achieved great success in quite a few domains , the advantages of traditional local features, especially in ne-grained ob- ject search tasks, are evident given their low computational requirement and robustness to scale, rotation, illumination changes and cluttered background. in general, local patches extracted by various interest point detectors are expected to be described by descriptors that are discriminative and tolerant to geometrical and illuminative variations. despite efforts have been devoted to developing kinds of descriptors, the performances of exist- ing descriptors are still limited especially under conditions where illumination changes greatly. such changes occur frequently in real-world scenarios. for example, as shown in fig. , the rst row shows the same landmark taken under different weather and lighting, the second row shows the face images under different illumination condition, the third row displays the same corresponding author. tel. + email addresses: miaozhenwei@gmail.com , ekhyap@ntu.edu.sg , exdjiang@ntu.edu.sg , sinduja@ntu.edu.sg , zhwang.me@gmail.com preprint submitted to elsevier january , arxiv:v dec figure : sample images of commercial designs with different illuminations. the rst row shows the same landmarks captured under different whether and lighting, the second rows shows the face with different illumination, the third row shows the wallpaper with different colors and fourth row shows the logos with contrast variation. logo in t-shirts with opposite contrast while the fourth row shows the identical art design pattern implemented in completely different level of illumination. in such cases, previous descriptors encounter difculties in recognition and retrieving the images with the identical objects yet dif- ferent illumination conditions. there are two types of contrast changes: bright-dark order preserved changes and the bright- dark order disturbed changes. in images with bright-dark order preserved changed, the relative order of the pixel intensity remains the same while the image patch becomes either brighter or darker following linear and/or nonlinear transformations. in contrast, images with bright-dark disturbed changes will not retain the relative order. the majority of previous local feature de- scriptors, such as sift , gloh and pca-sift , are designed for the rst type. sift is suggested to be the most stable descriptor for common image deformations . it consists of a array of histograms, and each histogram contains eight orientation bins that are weighted by the gradient magnitudes. because of the location and orientation quantizations, the sift descriptor is robust to small geometric distortion and location errors. as an extension of sift, the gloh enhances the robustness and discriminative ability by increasing the number of spatial bins and orientation to and , respectively. the principal component analysis is carried out to reduce the number of feature dimensions of gloh to be equivalent to sifts. figure : image patches with different illuminations. each row shows image patches from the same design. pca-sift further reduces the dimensions of sift from to by applying pca to gra- dient image patches. although these descriptors are robust to certain variations and distortions, they fail to address the issues caused by severe nonlinear illumination changes and bright-dark order disturbed changes as abovementioned . recently, alternative local feature descriptors have been proposed to solve the problems caused by illumination changes. instead of using the gradient orientation and magnitude, the intensity order is adopted by the local intensity order pattern descriptor . the lo- cal image region is divided into several sub-regions according to the intensity order of pixels in that region. local intensity order patterns are computed to describe each sub-region. as a result, liop can identify features with consistent illumination changes in which the order of pixel inten- sity is preserved. however, it cannot effectively tackle the bright-dark order of the pixel changes that may be caused by noises, illumination direction changes, illumination sources changes, or articial designs as shown in fig. the bright-dark disturbed changes are even more complicated than the order preserved ones. to the best of our knowledge, few works have been done to solve the bright-dark dis- turbed changes where both the amplitude and the relative order of the bright/dark pixels may vary. when the gradient orientation changes to its opposite direction with a degree rota- tion , the rotated descriptor cannot be matched with the original one. however, the original images and the bright/dark inverted images can be converted by a xed transfer function , allowing the distribution of gradient orientation and amplitudes in a local region to be transfered in a different order. hence, the mirror and inversion invariant sift is developed with a canonical form to identify the relationship between descrip- tors in the original image patches and the illumination/mirror inversed ones. the mi-sift is figure : flowchart of the proposed dci descriptor. gradient of image patch, laplace gradient, histogram of laplace gradient in the blocks, divergence-based brightness ipping estimator, original dci order, dci order under brigh-dark ip case, and dci descriptor after l normalization and square rooting. invariant to both the bright and geometric ipping through replacing the corresponding bins in the sift descriptor with symmetric bins. the max-sift is designed with a different ap- proach from using advanced arithmetic operations; it rearranges the sift bins under different ipped versions with the original bins. both of mi-sift and max-sift descriptors can work for instances of bright and/or geometric ipping. however, they still cannot solve the problem of partial illumination changes as shown in fig. although the shape context using edges instead of image intensities provides a potential ways to describe local regions with partial illumination changes, stable edge detection is challenging and unclear. in this work, we propose a novel descriptor named discriminative and contrast invertible descriptor. the dci is designed to enhance the performance of local feature descriptors for large illumination changes and contrast inversions. unlike the local gradients that are easily affected by illumination conditions, a laplace gradient we proposed in this paper is effective in capturing local characteristics with illumination variations. the dci descriptor is formed by concatenating the histograms of the laplace gradient in different bins. moreover, to address the bright/dark inversion problem, we proposed an inversion-estimation function based on the divergence of gradient. the proposed descriptor is evaluated across diverse object visual search tasks, including searching logos, commercial design images and faces. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dci descriptor outperforms the state-of-the-art descriptors. orientation bin amplitude mean of hog orientation bin amplitude mean of holg figure : mean of the eight-bin hog and holg over ,, interest points.","Local feature description is crucial in various applications such as image retrieval, object search, and face recognition. Traditional local features have advantages in fine-grained object search tasks due to their low computational requirement and robustness to scale, rotation, illumination changes, and cluttered backgrounds. However, existing descriptors struggle under significant illumination changes. To address this, a novel Discriminative and Contrast Invertible (DCI) descriptor is proposed. The DCI descriptor utilizes a Laplace gradient to capture local characteristics effectively and incorporates histograms of the Laplace gradient in different bins. Additionally, an inversion-estimation function based on gradient divergence is introduced to tackle bright/dark inversion issues. Experimental results show that the DCI descriptor outperforms state-of-the-art descriptors in various object visual search tasks."
"the laplace gradient and the divergence based contrast ipping estimation function are pro- posed in the dci descriptor to solve the problems caused by the brightness intensity and bright- dark order changes. fig. illustrates the work ow of the dci descriptor. as how the sift descriptor is developed, a local patch with the standard size of is extracted around each interest point at the given scale and aligned along its dominant orientation . following that, the gradient of the image patch is extracted as shown in fig. the laplace gradient shown in fig. is computed to enhance the discriminative ability and robustness to brightness changes. then, the laplace gradient map in fig. is divided into sub-regions. the distribution of the laplacian gradient in each sub-regions are quantized into an eight-orientation-bin histogram weighted by the gradient variation to represent each sub-region in fig. to handle the bright-dark order disturbed changes, the convergence based contrast ipping estimator in is generated. according to the sign of the estimator, either the original order version in fig. or the inverted order in fig. is chosen to encode the descriptor. lastly, the histograms in each block are concatenated into one vector. rooting algorithm is applied to further enhance the descriptor. the rooted histogram as shown in fig. after l normalization forms the nal dci descriptor.","The laplace gradient and divergence-based contrast flipping estimation function in the DCI descriptor aim to address issues caused by brightness intensity and bright-dark order changes. A workflow similar to the SIFT descriptor is followed, where local patches are extracted and aligned based on dominant orientation. The laplace gradient is computed to enhance discriminative ability and robustness to brightness changes. The gradient map is divided into sub-regions, quantized into an eight-orientation-bin histogram weighted by gradient variation. To handle bright-dark order changes, a contrast flipping estimator is used to determine whether the original or inverted order version should be encoded. Histograms from each block are concatenated into one vector, with a rooting algorithm applied for further enhancement. Finally, after L normalization, the rooted histogram forms the final DCI descriptor."
"the rationale to use image gradient is that it can capture both the spacial and frequency infor- mation . inspired by the model of biological neuron network in which each neuron responses here we follow the default of the sift descriptor provided in vlfeat http://www.vlfeat.org/ to a gradient with certain orientation and spatial frequency , image gradient is utilized in local descriptor. different from the biological vision system that uses numerous neurons to pro- cess the gradient information, a local descriptor uses one statistical histogram of image gradient to describe image patchs. for changes caused by rotation, scale and viewpoints, the local patches are usually anchored by the locally detected image structures with certain image patterns (e.g., the blob detectors). problems arise in these descriptors: ) the alignment of image patches with the dominant orientation may reduce the discriminative ability of histogram of gradient based descriptor, and ) the detected regions, either blobs or corners, whose shapes are similar, may reduce its discriminative ability as well. one of the solutions for addressing the image rotation variation is to use dominate orientation for aligning the image patches. nevertheless, this alignment is criticized for the information lost, as some bins with extremely large value override the rest bins. in order to analyze the dominate orientation in a more sufcient manner, the average of the eight-bin histogram of gradient over ,, local regions aligned by the dominant orientation is used. as shown in fig. , the rst-bin in the averaged histogram is much larger than other bins. it is about times of the second bin and about times of the third bin. in order to suppress the dominant bins with extreme values, hard truncation is adopted in the sift algorithm . however, a side effect of the suppression is that it will introduce nonlinear distortion, undermining the performance of the descriptor. another limitation of the gradient based descriptor is that the gradient eld is characterized by the same pattern as the described image patch, whichever is a blob or corner. consequently, using the gradient histogram to represent the distributions of the gradient would not be able to distinguish different images. this weakness becomes even evident in conditions when the strong illumination changes lead to great inuence of both the gradient orientation and amplitude. rather than using the rst order derivatives to capture the orientation information in a local patch, the laplace gradient uses the third order derivatives to describe the local patches. with illumination changes, the high order surface information such as the curvature is more resistant compared to the lower order information. considering that isotropic operators are helpful in cap- turing the more invariant information, the laplace gradient dened in the following is employed to describe the local patch. let the image gradient g at location x be g = i = i x i + i y j where x = {x, y} is the coordinate, i is the pixel intensity and i and j are the directions along x and y axises. the laplace gradient is dened as d = g = i x + i xy  i + i yx + i y  j . the laplacian operator can boost the discriminative information of local features while enhanc- ing the structures of the local patch that are characterized by the high order derivative. the implementation of the laplace gradient is straightforward. let choose the common used laplacian operator = . substituting into yields d = g + g + g + g), where x, x, x and x are the adjacent horizontal and vertical neighborhoods cells of x. from the laplace gradient, eight-bin histogram of laplace gradient is formed to represent the corresponding blocks as shown in fig. the average of the holg over ,, local regions is shown in fig. . it is suggested that the holg alleviates the overriding-bin problem compared to that of the hog. in order to further test the performance of the holg, a image pair as shown in fig. is selected. take the rst and the third images in the third row. these two images are in the same sketch form yet in different painting color. their intensity values of the corresponding gray images differ from each other a lot, leading to a dra- matically decrease in the descriptor matching rate. the recall-precision which is calculated by the ratio of the number of correctly matched point pairs over the incorrectly matched point pairs is employed here to evaluate the performance of the descriptors. the matching strategy considers the nearest neighbor distance ratio and declares a match if the distance ratio between the rst and the second nearest neighbors is below a threshold. the number of correct matches and ground truth correspondence is determined by the overlap error. a match is correct if the overlap error< . the results are presented with recall versus -precision curves recall = #correct matches #correspondences, precision = #false matches #all matches , where #correspndeces is the ground truth number of matches. as shown in fig. , the dci descriptor implemented on the basis of the laplace gradient achieves a better recall-precision under the large illumination changes. from this we can nd that the holg based dci descriptor has a drastically better performance than the hog based descriptors such as sift, maxsift, lide, misift and the intensity order based descriptor liop.","The section explains the use of image gradients in local descriptors, focusing on the limitations and solutions related to rotation, scale, and viewpoint changes. It introduces the Laplace Gradient method as a solution to capture more invariant information using third-order derivatives to describe local patches. The Laplace Gradient aims to boost discriminative features and enhance local patch structures. An eight-bin histogram of Laplace Gradient is formed to represent blocks, showing improved performance compared to gradient-based descriptors like HOG. The section concludes with results showing that the DCl descriptor based on the Laplace Gradient outperforms other descriptors under large illumination changes, indicating its superior performance in descriptor matching tasks."
"as for the bright-dark ipping issue, a simple way to consider is reversing the contrast of the whole image to the opposite intensity. however, as suggested in , converting the whole images to the inverted contrast is only optimal to the global image contrast inversion. if only parts of the images contrast are inverted, the ipping approach is not applicable. the mi-sift uses an average of both the sift before and after ipping. however, the discriminative ability is comprised by this way. alternatively, a criterion is set to determine whether a certain region should be ipped or not. for instance, the max-sift takes the maximun alphabetical order of the two transformed version as the criterion. however, the results are subject to noises. in view of previous limitations, we propose to use the divergence of the local region to de- termine whether the local region is bright or dark. a bright blob is a region that the gradient precision recall sift liop misift maxsift ride dci figure : performance comparison of the sift, liop, misift, maxsift, ride and dci descriptors under the large illumination changes. converges to the center whereas a dark blob is the region that the gradient diverges to the center. the divergence of gradient is dened as divg = g = i. the equation indicates that the divergence of the gradient is the laplacian of the image. thus, it is plausible that the blob can be detected by the response of the laplacian lter. the response of the laplacian lter produces the largest signal to noise ratio at the center of the blob region because its shape matches with that of the blob. therefore, it is conceivable that the divergence is more reliable in detecting whether this region is bright or dark. the surface integration of the divergence is = zz s divgds. the implementation of the surface integration is clear. it can be easily computed from the gradi- ent. based on the stokes theorem , the integration of the divergence gradient over a surface equals to the integration of the gradient over the boundary of the local region, that is = zz s divgds = i l g ndl, where n is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the boundary. table : retrieval performance on the belgalogos database. logos sift liop mi-sift max-sift ride dci % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % map % % % % % %","For addressing bright-dark flipping issues, traditional approaches involve inverting the contrast of the whole image, which may not be suitable for local contrast inversion. Various methods have been proposed, such as averaging SIFT descriptors before and after flipping or using a criterion based on transformation results. However, these methods have limitations in discriminative ability and susceptibility to noise. A proposed alternative method suggests using the local region's divergence to determine brightness, where bright regions have gradients converging to the center and dark regions have gradients diverging from the center. The divergence of the gradient, equivalent to the Laplacian of the image, helps detect blobs effectively by providing a reliable indicator of brightness. Surface integration of the divergence can then be calculated and utilized for determining bright and dark regions accurately."
"with the laplace gradient, an additional step to tackle the illumination changes is adopting the rooting algorithm . although l normalization is carried out for the concatenation of the histograms from the laplace gradient, the normalization cannot effectively respond to the problems caused by the nonlinear illumination changes. inspired by the work in , the rooting algorithm, instead of the hard truncation threshold , is incorporated by simply taking the square root of descriptor value in each dimension. as a summary, the dci descriptor is derived as follows. let the concatenation of the laplace gradient in all the sub-regions be h = {h, , h}. the l normalized h is hn = {hn, , hn} where hin = hi p h . the dci descriptor hnr is the square root of the elements in h, dened as hnr = { p hn, , p hn}. the performance of the dci descriptor will be evaluated in the following section.","The DCI Descriptor tackles illumination changes by incorporating the rooting algorithm, which involves taking the square root of descriptor values in each dimension instead of using hard truncation thresholds.

The performance of the DCI descriptor will be evaluated in the subsequent section."

"the reason we choose wallpaper as a test set is that it includes a considerable number of images with various illumination variations from the same design. samples of a wallpaper design are shown in the third row of fig. in total, the reference image set contains images from categories which are provided by a wallpaper design company. the test image set contains , images. the wallpaper search algorithm in is implemented in this. specically, the hierarchical k-means clustering is used to train the scalable vocabulary tree . a branch factor of and depth of are set for the svt. a total of ,, words are trained for the quantization. while keeping the original aspect ratio, the images are normalized to the standard size with the longest dimension as pixels. the interest point detector is a combination of the dense and the adaptive sparse sift which is the same as that in . both sparse and dense local interest points are used to anchor the local features. the map is calculated to indicate the retrieval performance. the image retrieval results in table show that the proposed dci improves the retrieval performance by % compared with the other descriptors. it demonstrates that the dci is more robust to the severe contrast changes which widely exist in the wallpaper datasets. figure : logo detection results based on the sift and dci descriptors. the rst row shows the results obtained using the sift descriptor marked with yellow bounding box, and the second row illustrates the results obtained using the proposed dci descriptor marked with red bounding box. the proposed dci can effectively detect both two logos in these two images but sift cannot. as shown in fig. , eyeballing two images with large illumination changes can nd that both the sift and liop descriptors identify only limited number of correctly matched pairs in the event of severe illumination changes. in contrast, the proposed dci descriptor can identify much more correctly matched pairs, suggesting its superior performance to other evaluated descriptors.","The section analyzes wallpaper visual search, selecting wallpaper images due to their diverse illumination variations.

arxiv:v dec on center of mass and foliations by constant spacetime mean curvature surfaces for isolated systems in general relativity carla cederbaum and anna sakovich abstract. we propose a new foliation of asymptotically euclidean initial data sets by -spheres of constant spacetime mean curvature . the leaves of the foliation have the stcmc-property regardless of the initial data set in which the foliation is constructed which asserts that there is a plethora of stcmc - spheres in a neighborhood of spatial innity of any asymptotically at spacetime. the stcmc-foliation can be understood as a covariant relativistic generalization of the cmc-foliation suggested by huisken and yau . we show that a unique stcmc-foliation exists near innity of any asymptot- ically euclidean initial data set with non-vanishing energy which allows for the denition of a new notion of total center of mass for isolated systems. this stcmc- center of mass transforms equivariantly under the asymptotic poincar e group of the ambient spacetime and in particular evolves under the einstein evolution equations like a point particle in special relativity. the new denition also remedies subtle deciencies in the cmc-approach to dening the total center of mass suggested by huisken and yau which were described by cederbaum and nerz .,"The text introduces a new foliation method for isolated systems in general relativity by -spheres of constant spacetime mean curvature. This foliation is referred to as STCMC-foliation and is a relativistic generalization of the CMC-foliation. It allows for the definition of a new notion of total center of mass for isolated systems, which transforms equivariantly under the asymptotic Poincaré group and evolves like a point particle in special relativity. This new approach also addresses deficiencies in the previously suggested CMC-approach to defining the total center of mass for isolated systems."
"in general relativity, isolated systems are individual or clusters of stars, black holes, or galaxies that do not interact with any matter or gravitational radiation outside the system under consideration. intuitively, they should have a total center of mass which should in a suitable sense behave as a point particle in special relativity. in this paper, we suggest a denition of total center of mass for suitably isolated systems and argue that this center of mass notion indeed behaves as a point particle in special relativity in a suitable sense (meaning it transforms equivariantly under the asymptotic poincar e group of the ambient spacetime). in particular, we will show that the center of mass notion we suggest evolves in time under the einstein evolution equations like a point particle in special relativity. the main idea of our approach is to modify the denition of center of mass given by huisken and yau for asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifolds using an asymptotic foliation by -spheres of constant mean curvature , see section by staging it in a lorentzian setting or in other words by staging it in asymptotically euclidean initial data sets. more specically, we will prove existence and uniqueness of an asymptotic foliation by -spheres of constant spacetime mean curvature under optimal asymptotic decay assumptions. here, spacetime constant mean curvature means that the co-dimension mean curvature vector h of each -sphere has constant lorentzian length h. date: january , mathematics subject classication. c, . carla cederbaum and anna sakovich it is well known that this stcmc-condition can be reformulated in terms of initial data sets, namely as the product of the inner and outer expansions (or null mean curvatures, see remark ) with respect to any given null frame along a -surface. on the other hand, the stcmc-condition is naturally independent of the initial data set in which the foliation is constructed. our result thus asserts that there is a plethora of stcmc-surfaces in a neighborhood of spatial innity of any asymptotically at spacetime. furthermore, the new construction of a center of mass will be shown to remedy the subtle deciencies of the huisken and yau approach described by cederbaum and nerz . last but not least, we will provide an asymptotic ux integral formula for the center of mass extending that of beig and o murchadha . the analytic techniques in our proofs rely on those developed by metzger and nerz . concluding this introduction, we would like to point out that the notion of space- time mean curvature of -surfaces in initial data sets has independently been con- sidered in other contexts, both before and after the results of this paper had been announced. for example, the inverse spacetime mean curvature ow has been studied by bray, hayward, mars, and simon in and by hangjun xu in his thesis . the stcmc-condition is satised by marginally outer/inner trapped surfaces , extremal surfaces , and generalized apparent horizons (see e.g. , ), with spacetime mean curvature h = in all those cases. more generally, -surfaces with constant spacetime mean curvature are critical points for the area functional inside the future-directed null-cone, with mean curvature vector pointing in the direction in which the expansion of the surface is extremal. the aforementioned generalized apparent horizons have outer area minimizing property which is appealing in the view of spacetime penrose inequality. we would like to point the reader to the interesting work by carrasco and mars giving insights into the generality of h = as a condition for a horizon. in a recent paper of cha and khuri , the area a of the outermost stcmc-surface with h = appears in the conjectured penrose inequality m p a/ expected to hold for an asymptotically anti-de sitter initial data set of mass m satisfying the dominant energy condition. because of the spacetime geometry nature of the stcmc-condition, we expect that stcmc-surfaces and stcmc-foliations will have a number of applications beyond the denition of a center of mass of an isolated system as well as beyond the setting of asymptotically euclidean initial data sets. for example, a special subfamily of stcmc-surfaces foliating a null hypersurface implicitly appears in recent work by klainerman and szeftel , where they arise as surfaces with both constant outer and constant inner expansion. structure of the paper. in section , we will summarize the necessary denitions and notations as well as more details on the background and existing work on the total center of mass of isolated systems. in section , we will state our main results and very briey explain the strategy of our proofs. the following sections will be dedicated to the more technical components of the proof with section focusing on a priori esti- mates for stcmc-surfaces, section discussing the linearization of spacetime mean curvature, section asserting existence of the stcmc-foliation, section introducing the coordinate expression of the center of mass associated with the stcmc-foliation, center of mass and stcmc-foliations and section proving the claimed law of time evolution under the einstein evolution equations. appendix a collects results such as sobolev inequalities on -surfaces, while appendix b studies stcmc-surfaces in normal geodesic coordinates. finally, in section , we will discuss an exemplary initial data set highlighting the dierences between the newly suggested notion of center of mass and the existing one

"recall that an initial data set for the einstein equations is a tuple where is a smooth riemannian manifold and k is a smooth symmetric - tensor eld on m playing the role of the second fundamental form of m in an ambient lorentzian spacetime. the local energy density and the local momentum density j dened on m can be read ofrom the constraint equations scal |k| + = divg) = j. here, tr, div, and | | denote the trace, the divergence, and the tensor norm with respect to g, respectively, and scal denotes its scalar curvature. sometimes we will nd it convenient to use the conjugate momentum tensor := g k. the constraint equations arise as a consequence of the gausscodazzimainardi equations from the einstein equations ric scal g = t satised by a given space- time with energy-momentum tensor t, where g is the riemannian metric induced by the lorentzian metric g on the spacelike hypersurface m and k is the induced second fundamental form. letting denote the timelike future unit normal to the initial data set , the energy and momentum density are derived from t via = t, and j = t, and the stress tensor s on m is dened by s = t. the constraint equations thus necessarily hold on any spacelike hypersurface in the spacetime . in order to model an isolated system, we will assume that the ambient space- time with its energy-momentum tensor t and the choice of initial data set are such that the initial data set is asymptotically euclidean, a notion made precise in the following standard denition. carla cederbaum and anna sakovich denition . let (, ] and let be a smooth initial data set. assume there is a smooth coordinate chart x: m\b r\br dened in the region exterior to a compact set b m we say that i := is a c / +-asymptotically euclidean initial data set (with respect to x) if there is a constant c = c(i, x) such that, in the coordinates x = r \ br, we have the pointwise estimates |gij ij| + | x ||kgij| + | x ||klgij| c| x | |kij| + | x ||kkij| c| x | || + |ji| c| x | for all x r\br and for all i, j, k, l {, , }. here, slightly abusing notation, we have silently pushed forward all tensor elds on m and written gij := ( xg)ij as well as kij := ( xk)ij, etc. the kronecker delta ij denotes the components of the euclidean metric with respect to the coordinates x. by another slight abuse of notation, we will refer to the above constant c as ci, suppressing the dependence on the chart x. asymptotically euclidean initial data sets are well-known to possess well-dened total energy, linear momentum, and mass. more precisely, if i = is a c / +-asymptotically euclidean initial data set for any > (naturally extending the denition to > ), its energy e and its linear momentum p = are given by e := lim r | x |=r x i,j xj r d, p j := lim r | x |=r x i ij xi r d, respectively, where d denotes the area measure induced on the coordinate sphere {| x | = r} by the euclidean metric and adm stands for arnowittdesermisner . the quantities e and p are well-dened under the asymptotic conditions imposed here for arbitrary > meaning the expressions converge and e is asymp- totically independent of the chart x while p is asymptotically covariant under chart deformations in a suitable way. from them, one denes the mass by m := q e | p| whenever this expression makes sense, that is whenever the energy-momentum - vector (e, p) is causal with respect to the minkowski metric of special relativity. remark . for in the above denition, one can nd an asymp- totic chart x on the canonical euclidean initial data set ieucl. = with respect to which ieucl. is c /+-asymptotically euclidean but the expression e does not van- ish as it should for euclidean space, see denisov and soloviev . this explains the suggestive notation of the decay order as / + . center of mass and stcmc-foliations on the other hand, if > for an initial data set i, a simple computation shows that it has e = p = which is non-desirable in the context of discussing the center of mass and asymptotic foliations by constant mean curvature. this explains why we exclude this case in denition . remark . if a riemannian manifold (with asymptotic chart x) satises and its scalar curvature satises |scal| c| x | for all x r \ br, we say that is a c / +- asymptotically euclidean manifold. this is called the riemannian case, the reason being that one can reinterpret this as saying that the trivially extended initial data set (m, g, k , = scal, j ) satises -. in the riemannian case, the notions mass m and energy e can be and are used interchangeably.","The text discusses initial data sets for the Einstein equations, which consist of a smooth Riemannian manifold and a smooth symmetric tensor field serving as the second fundamental form in a Lorentzian spacetime. The local energy and momentum densities are derived from constraint equations involving scalar curvature, divergence, and tensor norms. Asymptotically Euclidean initial data sets are defined for isolated systems, with total energy, linear momentum, and mass well-defined. The concept of asymptotic Euclidean manifolds and the interchangeability of mass and energy in the Riemannian case are explained."
"we now proceed to discussing the total center of mass of an asymptotically euclidean initial data set i = with energy e = the assumption e = is both technical (as many denitions of center of mass explicitly divide by e) and physically reasonable when considering the center of mass. first, let us remark that our eld knows many denitions of center of mass for isolated systems. the rst denitions were given in terms of asymptotic ux integral expressions in coordinates, similar to those of energy and linear momentum above, see below and the text surrounding it. in , huisken and yau proved existence and uniqueness of a foliation by constant mean curvature -spheres near innity of an asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifold of positive energy e > and related it to a denition of center of mass in a way described below and in more detail in sec- tion more recently, chen, wang, and yau suggested a new denition of center of mass for isolated systems which is constructed from optimal isometric embeddings into the at minkowski spacetime of special relativity. for a brief, non-complete summary of other denitions of center of mass, please see . flux integral denition. the most prominent ux integral notion of center of mass cb om = (c b om, c b om, c b om) for asymptotically euclidean initial data sets was in- troduced by beig and o murchadha as the asymptotic ux integral c l b om := e lim r | x |=r "" xl x i,j xj r x i  gil xi r gii xl r # d, a denition going back in parts to regge and teitelboim . see szabados for valuable critical comments on this denition, and see section for a covariant generalization of this formula following from our work. the center of mass integral cb om will in general not converge for initial data sets i = which are merely c /+-asymptotically euclidean with respect to some chart x and have e = it will however converge once one assumes that the initial data set satises certain asymptotic symmetry conditions in the given chart x, as for example the reggeteitelboim conditions introduced in , see and denition below. we also point out that the expression for cb om does not explicitly depend on the second fundamental form k of the initial data set. carla cederbaum and anna sakovich denitions via foliations. several authors dene the center of mass of an initial data set i = via a foliation by -spheres near innity. following cederbaum and nerz , we will call such denitions abstract in contrast to the more explicit coordinate denitions of center of mass, see below. the rst abstract denition of center of mass was given in by huisken and yau , who proved existence and uniqueness of a foliation near the asymptotic end of an asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifold by closed, stable -spheres of constant mean curvature, the cmc-foliation. this goes back to an idea of christo- doulou and yau . in , metzger considered a foliation by -spheres of constant null mean curvature and concluded that this foliation is not fully suitable for dening a center of mass. for a more detailed review of foliations suggested to study in this context and of recent progress in terms of necessary and sucient asymptotic decay conditions, please see . huisken and yau also assign a coordinate center to their foliation. it is con- structed from the abstract cmc-center as a euclidean center of the cmc-foliation as follows: first, any closed, oriented -surface r has a euclidean coordinate center c dened by c := x d := || x d. picking a xed asymptotically at coordinate chart x: m \ b r \ br, this denition can naturally be extended to closed, oriented -surfaces m \ b by pushing forward to r and identifying c := c ( x), slightly abusing notation. we will also call this center euclidean center of (with respect to x). this naturally extends to asymptotic foliations: denition . let i = be a c /+-asymptotically euclidean initial data set for a chart x: m \ b r \ br. let {}> be a foliation of the asymptotic end m \ b of m with area radius r = p ||/ of diverging to as . denote by c the euclidean coordinate center of the leaf with respect to x. then the coordinate center c = of the foliation {}> (with respect to the asymptotic chart x) is given by c := lim c , in case the limit exists. otherwise, we say that the coordinate center of the foliation {}> diverges (with respect to the asymptotic chart x). the vector c can be pictured to describe a point in the target r of the asymptoti- cally at coordinate chart x: m \b r \br, but it need not lie in the image of x, and indeed will often lie inside br. this means it cannot necessarily be pulled back into m moreover, c depends on the choice of asymptotic chart x at least a priori. coming back to the cmc-foliation constructed by huisken and yau , it is well-known that the coordinate center chy of the cmc-foliation of a suitably asymp- totically at riemannian manifold or initial data set of non- vanishing energy e with respect to a given asymptotic chart x coincides with the center of mass and stcmc-foliations beig o murchadha center of mass vector cb om dened by , provided that some additional symmetry assumptions are satised, see huang , eichmair and metz- ger , and nerz . the most optimal result to date states that for c / +-asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifolds with e = satisfying the c +-reggeteitelboim condition , we have chy = cb om whenever both denitions converge, and that divergence of one implies divergence of the other. again, let us point out that the construction of chy does not explicitly depend on the second fundamental form k of the initial data set under consideration. we furthermore note that the product e cb om is sometimes referred to as the center of mass charge in the literature, even when e = we will not follow this usage here. in this paper, we construct a novel geometric foliation {}> of the asymp- totically at end m \ b of a given c / +-asymptotically euclidean initial data set with non-vanishing energy e = , namely a foliation with constant spacetime mean curvature -leaves, see section the general approach to dene the coordinate center of a foliation {}> described above will then be ap- plied to this new foliation to obtain a new denition of the coordinate center of mass of an initial data set as well as a coordinate expression analogous to and extending , see section","The text discusses different definitions of the center of mass for isolated systems within the context of asymptotically euclidean initial data sets. Various definitions are explored, including flux integral definitions, foliation-based definitions, and coordinate-based definitions. Notably, Beig and O Murchadha introduced a prominent flux integral notion of center of mass, while Huisken and Yau proposed a foliation-based definition using constant mean curvature spheres. The text also mentions a new definition suggested by Chen, Wang, and Yau based on optimal isometric embeddings. These definitions are further refined in the context of asymptotic symmetry conditions and coordinate charts.

Initial data sets are considered within a one-parameter family, and the proofs rely on continuity and asymptotically euclidean properties. By establishing relationships between different initial data sets and utilizing the energy computation, the proofs are streamlined without explicitly mentioning specific charts. Additionally, the use of center of mass and STCMC-foliations aids in demonstrating the desired results. The methodology ensures that the theorems and lemmas hold in the Riemannian setting, supported by Nerz's work. The implications of the continuity approach are further detailed in the section, with the implicit function theorem playing a key role in demonstrating openness and closedness in the method of continuity."

"in this section, we will introduce the spacetime mean curvature map h in a given initial data set i = . we will analyze its properties in a neighborhood of a given -surface having constant spacetime mean curvature. we will show that the linearization of the map h is invertible when the linearization is computed with respect to normal variations within the given initial data set i. this will later be used to ensure that the cmc-foliation of constructed in can be pushed via a method of continuity to an stcmc-foliation of i. throughout this section, we will assume that i = is a c / +- asymptotically euclidean initial data set with non-vanishing energy e = and with xed asymptotic coordinates x. furthermore, it will be assumed that is a xed - surface of constant spacetime mean

of this map h is computed in the following lemma. lemma . let m be a closed, oriented -surface. let v : m be the normal variation with v = id and v t t= = f for f c. then the linearization lh of the

spacetime mean curvature h = h p and the well-known formulas for h) t t= and p ) t t=, see metzger [, lemma ]. carla cederbaum and anna sakovich the map lh naturally extends to a bounded mapping lh : w , l in section , we will prove that this mapping has a bounded inverse, for which it is convenient to rewrite the above expression for lh in the form lhf = lf q   p h , where lf := f )f p h  )f k  . since the denominator is clearly bounded and bounded away from zero by our as- sumptions on , the invertibility of lh : w , l will follow once we show that l: w , l is invertible with bounded inverse. remark . recall that the hp-stability operator lhp of the map hp (surfaces of constant expansion or null mean curvature) is given by lhpf = ) t t= = f )f  )f k  , see . as it turns out, the analytic properties of lhp imply that constant ex- pansion foliations do not provide an adequate notion of center of mass, in contrast to the stcmc-foliation studied here. the main dierence is that the contribution of the second fundamental form k in the h p-stability operator is large, while it is rescaled by a factor p/ h in the stcmc-stability operator. the largeness of the contribution of k in the h p-stability operator will cause the geometric centers of the surfaces of the foliation to drift away in the direction of the linear momentum p in general, see metzger . this can only be avoided by imposing very fast fall-oconditions on k to ensure that p = furthermore, a certain smallness assumption on k is also directly required to ensure the invertibility of lhp, and hence the existence of the constant expansion foliation, see . as a consequence of the factor p/ h in the stcmc-stability operator, no smallness assumption on k will be needed to ensure the existence of the foliation by surfaces of constant spacetime mean curvature. furthermore, we will see that the leaves of this foliation do not translate as their spacetime mean curvature approaches zero, provided that the standard asymptotic symmetry conditions are imposed. as we will see, the operator l, and consequently the operator lh, is in many respects similar to the standard stability operator of , namely to lhf = h) t t= = f )f. this operator has been intensively studied, see e.g. . . eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of . in preparation for proving the invertibility of the operator l, we summarize the spectral properties of the op- erator , the laplacian calculated with respect to the metric g induced by . for this, let us rst consider the operator s r, the laplacian calculated with respect to the standard round metric s r on s r = s r( ) . center of mass and stcmc-foliations the eigenvalues of s r are l/ r for l , and the eigenspace corresponding to l/ r is given by the space of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree l re- stricted to s r, see e.g. . in particular, the rst non-zero eigenvalue of s r is / r, the corresponding eigenspace is spanned by the restrictions to s r of the coordinate functions x, x, x on r in the following, we enumerate the eigenvalues of s r counting their multiplicity by = < i i+, i = , , . . . , and we denote the associated complete l(s r)-orthonormal system of eigenfunctions by {f i } i= without loss of generality, we may assume that the chosen enumeration is such that f i = r r xi for i = , , note that the tracefree part of the hessian of each of these functions vanishes, and that we have s rf i , s rf j ij r + f i f j r = for i = , , , where s r denotes the gradient with respect to s r. in order to describe the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator , note that by proposition there is a vector z r and a conformal parametrization : s r( z ) such that g s r( z )w ,(s r( z )) cr , where r is the area radius of . as all spheres of radius r in euclidean space are isometric, we can easily translate to a conformal parametrization : s r such that g s rw ,(s r) cr , where r still denotes the area radius of . we will

be chosen so that fi is asymptotic to f i for each i = , , . . . . for simplicity of notation, in what follows we will identify fi : r with its pullback fi without further ado. this enumeration and

constant and the lower bound on coming from this calculation only depend on , a, b, , and ci. we will now construct the respective eigenfunctions fi, for which we will use the fact that these functions are solutions to the equation s r(fi f i ) i(fi f i ) = ( s r)fi + (i i)fi, i = , , , where i = / r for i = , , noting that the right hand side of the equation equals s rfi ifi, and using integration by parts it is straightforward to check that it is orthogonal in l(s r) to any element in the kernel of the self-adjoint dierential operator in the left hand side. thus, by the fredholm alternative [, appendix i, theorem ], for every i = , , there is a unique solution fi f i w ,(s r) orthogonal in l(s r) to the linear space spanned by f i , i = , , note that we may without loss of generality assume that fil = so that fil = i = o. since scal = + o( ) as a consequence of the gauss equation (see e.g. below), in view of and lemma a. we have fiw , = o as f i = with the above

The proof highlights the relationships between energy, Hawking mass, and the invertibility of the operator L. The text also discusses the implications of the Fredholm alternative and provides corollaries regarding the estimates for functions in the specified function spaces.

with the example studied in section will also be studied in our forthcoming work. we conjecture the following sucient conditions, in line with bartniks and chru sciels corresponding results for

under the einstein evolution equations. we will show that the stcmc-center of mass has the same evolution properties as a point particle in special relativity, evolving according to the formula d dt cstcmc = p e . note that the analogous formula is valid for the cmc-center of mass and also for chenwangyaus center of mass, although under stronger decay assumptions, see and , respectively. theorem . let be a smooth, globally hyperbolic lorentzian spacetime satisfying the einstein equations with energy momentum tensor t. suppose that, outside a set of the form rk, k m compact, there is a dieomorphism idr x: r r ) which gives rise to asymptotic coordinates (t, x) on r . assume that i = is a c / +-asymptotically euclidean initial data set with respect to the coordinate chart x and with e = , and suppose additionally that k = o(| x |) with constant ci as | x | . now consider the c-parametrized family of c /+-asymptotically euclidean initial data sets i = , k, , j) with respect to x which starts from i = i, and which exists for all t for some t> assume furthermore that the constants ci are uniformly bounded on , without loss of generality such that ci ci carla cederbaum and anna sakovich assume the foliation i has initial lapse n = + o(| x | ) as | x | with decay measuring constant denoted by cn and initial shift x = , and suppose furthermore that the initial stress tensor s of i satises s = o(| x | ) as | x | . there is a constant t > , depending only on , ci, cn, and e such that the following holds: if the initial data set i has well-dened stcmc-center of mass cstcmc then the stcmc-center of mass cstcmc of i is also well-dened for |t| < t. furthermore, the initial velocity at t = is given by d dt t= cstcmc = p e . moreover, we have that d dt t= e = and d dt t= p = remark . in fact, one gets more information about the evolution of the stcmc- center of mass from the proof of theorem : not only the coordinate expression cstcmc evolves according to , but also the individual leaves of the stcmc- foliation evolve in a way more and more close to a translation in direction p/ e ac- cording to formula . remark . we expect that the evolution of the leaves of the stcmc-foliation as well as the evolution of cstcmc can actually be understood when replacing the condition k = o(| x |) by more natural conditions related to integrability criteria on the constraints when integrated against x. we will investigate this in our forthcoming work, see also remark and conjecture . remark . it is straightforward to prove a version of this theorem allowing for non- vanishing shift. as this is not of primary interest here and can also be xed by a suitable gauge, we will not go in this direction. proof. throughout this proof, dotted quantities like for example e will denote time derivatives at t = , e.g. e = d dte t= moreover, > , t > , and c > denote generic constants that may vary from line to line, but depend only on , ci, and e as well as on cn, the constant in the o-term of n. the einstein evolution equations with zero shift are given at t = by gij := d dt t= gij = nkij|t= = o(| x | ), kij := d dt t= kij = {hessij n + n(ricij ricij + kk i kjk tr kkij)} t= = o(| x | ), where ric is the ricci tensor of the spacetime , which is completely determined by the stress-energy tensor t through the einsteins equations ric scal g = t. here, we used that scal = trg t = o(| x | ) and thus ricij = o(| x | ). in particular, we see from the adm-formulas and respectively that the energy and linear momentum satisfy e = and p = , with respect to this variation. also, as e = and e is continuous, the initial data sets i have a unique foliation by surfaces of constant spacetime mean curvature near innity for |t| < t and mean center of mass and stcmc-foliations curvature radii > . this foliation depends in a c-fashion on t for |t| < t which can be seen as follows: perform a method of continuity procedure around t = as in the proof of theorems , or in the proof of lemma . note that, as the initial shift x was chosen to vanish, x = , we in fact know that the stcmc-surface variation is normal at t = this gives you an stcmc-foliation of i for each |t| < t which depends on t in a c-fashion. by theorem , this family of foliations must coincide with the one studied here and must thus depend on t in a c-fashion. now x > and let t denote the unique leaf of the stcmc-foliation with constant spacetime mean curvature h) / in the initial data set i, where |t| < t. for this, we use the product rule to see that = d dt t= h) = d dt t= h) + d dt t= h). the rst term on the right shows how the spacetime mean curvature changes if t is considered to be a varying surface in the initial data set i. as the initial shift vanishes and we thus have an initially normal variation, this term exactly gives our well-known linearization lhu, where the operator lh is as dened in lemma and u is the initial lapse function of the normal variation. the second term on the right shows how the spacetime mean curvature changes if is considered to be a xed surface in the varying initial data set i. more precisely, this term is d dt t= h) = h h p p h p , where h = h and p = p. in order to compute h = d dt t= h), we introduce geodesic normal coordi- nates in a neighborhood u m of , with yn such that n is the outer unit normal to the level set {yn = const.}, in particular n = on , and y, = , , are some coordinates on transported to u along the ow generated by n. note that in this case gnn = , gn = , and a = g = ng = ng = n , n n = , = in u, for all , , = , we will now drop the index on and just write instead for notational convenience. we use the standard formula for the variation of the second fundamental form when the ambient metric is changing (see e.g. section in ) and compute, using rst and , second the decay properties of n and the decay estimate for the second fundamental form a = h g + a, with g the metric induced on by i, namely |a| c from proposition , third adding some rich zeros, fourth because j = o by assumption, fth by , , , and nally , and proposition to note that our sign convention for the second

div k + ) + o, where the operator l is given by . this uniquely denes u w , by the invertibility of l, see proposition as the right hand side is bounded and thus in l in order to compute the initial velocity of i, we rst need to compute the initial velocity z of the euclidean coordinate center z = |t| t x d of t. we remind the reader that we chose coordinates x which do not depend on t. relying on proposition , we will now compute the variation of the coordinate center, z, starting from the variation formula zi || ui d c +ul the idea is to argue as in the proof of lemma and pass from u to lu, and from i to fi in . for this we note that since i is c / +-asymptotically euclidean, center of mass and stcmc-foliations and since k has faster fall-ok = o(| x |), we have lu = o(| x |) by . a computation identical to the one in the proof of lemma yields zi e p || filu d c . thus, and integration by parts give us zi + e p ||  k  , fi + fi  fi tr k  d c . recall that is approximated by

d c . passing to the limit when we obtain the result. . poincar e-covariance and accordance with special relativity. as we have seen before, whether or not a given -surface is stcmc is in fact independent of a choice of slice . in this sense, stcmc-surfaces are covariant in the sense of general relativity. the role of the initial data set then is to select a unique family of stcmc-surfaces near the asymptotic end of the spacetime, forming its abstract stcmc-center of mass. in this sense, stcmc-foliations and the associated center of mass are poincar e-covariant. we will now discuss the transformation behavior of the stcmc-coordinate cen- ter under the asymptotic poincar e group of the ambient spacetime assuming vanishing angular momentum in the boost case. dealing with angular momentum and treating the boost case more adequately will be left for our future work. let i = be an initial data set which is c / +-asymptotically euclidean with respect to asymptotic coordinates x and has e = euclidean motions. consider the coordinates y := o x + t, with o an orthogonal rotation matrix and t r a translation vector. in other words, y arises from x through a euclidean motion. then, for each leaf of the stcmc-foliation con- structed in theorem , we nd that the euclidean center of with respect to the y-coordinates is given by || y d = o  || x d  + t. carla cederbaum and anna sakovich thus, the stcmc-coordinate center c y stcmc = lim || y d with respect to the coordinates y converges if and only the stcmc-coordinate center c x stcmc = lim || x d converges with respect to the coordinates x converges and if they converge, we nd c y stcmc = o c x stcmc + t as one would expect from euclidean geometry, newtonian gravity, and from the description of the spacetime position of a point particle in special relativity. time translations. the transformation behavior of cstcmc under asymptotic time translation corresponds to its evolution behavior under the einstein equations. in other words, theorem tells us under the additional assumption k = o(| x |) that d dt t= cstcmc = p e which corresponds precisely to the instantaneous law of motion of a point particle in special relativity. boosts. the last constituent of the asymptotic poincar e group of the spacetime are of course the asymptotic boosts. in a given spacetime + hijdxidxj) with asymptotic coordinates x = and suitably decaying lapse n, shift x, and tensor h, a boosted initial data set i = is any spacelike hypersurface arising as the set {y = } with respect to a boosted coordinate system y := x, y = (y, y ), meaning that the matrix is a boost. if the lapse n, the shift x, and the tensor h decay suitably fast in space and time coordinate directions, the boosted initial data set {y = } = i is in fact c / +-asymptotically euclidean with respect to y. it is thus reasonable to ask how the stcmc-coordinate centers of the initial data sets {x = } and {y = } are related . the corresponding question was addressed by szabados for the b om-center of mass although from a slightly dierent perspective. of course, we expect that the stcmc- coordinate center boosts like the position of a point particle in special relativity, namely  c y stcmc  =  c x stcmc  , at least in the absence of angular momentum. this can easily be veried for example for a boosted slice in the schwarzschild spacetime where in fact the centers both coincide with the center of symmetry similarly, if one rst spatially translates the coordinates on the schwarzschild spacetime and then considers a boosted slice, the transformation law will be as in . in both of these examples, the deviation z introduced in theorem in fact vanishes, so that center of mass and stcmc-foliations the transformation law already holds for the cmc-b om-center of mass. in view of section below, it is possible to construct examples of boosted slices in the schwarzschild spacetime by boosting the example discussed below. one can then see that in fact also applies in this case, but only for the stcmc-center of mass, and not for the cmc-b om-center of mass. however, the computation is so tedious that we prefer not to show it here as it is not particularly enlightening. a proof of a generalized version of incorporating the angular momentum will be given elsewhere, see also remarks , .","The text discusses the concept of stcmc-foliations and the center of mass in the context of initial data sets with asymptotic properties. By deforming constant mean curvature foliations, unique stcmc-foliations are constructed, and the evolution of the coordinate center under this deformation is explored. The section introduces a lemma and proposition to analyze the change in the coordinate center. The convergence criteria for the center of mass are discussed, along with the implications of various assumptions and conditions on the convergence of the coordinate center. Further, the text delves into the evolution properties of the stcmc-center of mass under Einstein evolution equations, drawing connections to special relativity formulas. Covariance properties, transformation behaviors under Poincaré group elements, and the relationship between boosted initial data sets are explored.

"as briey sketched in sections , and analyzed in more detail in section , determining the coordinate center of an asymptotic foliation is tricky and depends on choosing suitable coordinates . in , this was illustrated by explicitly computing the coordinate center of the cmc-foliation of an asymptotically euclidean graphical time-slice in the schwarzschild spacetime of mass m = this example, to be described in more detail below, satises all assumptions in , in particular those of theorem , but yet its cmc-coordinate center does not converge. equivalently, its b om-center also does not converge. after a brief introduction to the graphical example discussed in , we will compute that the stcmc-coordinate center does in fact converge in this example and moreover converges to the origin , i.e. to the center of symmetry of the spherically symmetric spacetime as one would expect. we consider the schwarzschild spacetime of mass m = in schwarz- schild coordinates, meaning that m = s (r, ), g = ndt + g, g = ndr + rd, n = r m r , where d denotes the canonical metric on s we will freely switch between polar coordinates and the naturally corresponding cartesian coordinates x dened on m a graphical time-slice in the schwarzschild spacetime is an initial data set (m t, gt, kt, t , jt ) arising as the graph of a smooth function t : m r over the canonical time-slice {t = } , meaning that mt := {t = t( x) : x m}, while gt is the riemannian metric induced on mt and kt is the sec- ond fundamental form induced by this embedding with respect to the future pointing unit normal. computing the cmc-coordinate center of mass (via the b om-center of mass). clear- ly, the center of mass of the canonical time-slice {t = } of the schwarzschild space- time is the coordinate origin, ccmc = cb om = we will now compute this vector for graphical time-slices with the asymptotic decay conditions on t chosen such that carla cederbaum and anna sakovich (m t, gt, kt, t , jt ) is c -asymptotically euclidean with respect to the co- ordinates x. to most easily comply with the asymptotic decay conditions specied in section , we will assume that t = ok as r , with k now let y := x|mt denote the induced coordinates on mt . as computed in [, section ], the metric gt and second fundamental form kt are given by ij = gt = g n t,i t,j = gij n t,i t,j, ij = t,in,j + t,jn,i + n ijt nt,it,j dn q n|dt| g in the coordinates y. a straightforward computation shows that the graphical initial data set (m t, gt, kt, t , jt ) is indeed c -asymptotically euclidean and in fact has e = m = when evaluating the b om-center of mass surface integral on a nite coordinate sphere with respect to the y-coordinates in mt, using s := | y | and := y s, we nd h c  s s( ) i l = m s s( )  ij,i ii,j) ylyj s  il yi s ii yl s  d = m  s s( )  ylyj s  gil yi s gii yl s  d s s( )  ,i ,j  ylyj s d + s s( )  nt,it,l yi s nt,it,i yl s  d  = m  s s( )  st t,jjl + s t(grad t, )l  d + s s( )  t,ii t,l |dt| l  d  + o. as in , we pick a xed vector = u r and set t : r \ bm( ) r : x sin + u x r = o  r . we point out that this choice of t ensures that satises the rie- mannian c +-reggeteitelboim conditions so that or apply and ensure that ccmc = cb om or that both diverge. one directly computes from the above expression for cb om  s s( )  that cb om  s s( )  = cos m u + o which diverges as s . hence, the b om- and thus also the cmc-coordinate center diverge in this example. the corresponding formula for the second fundamental form in has a typo which we corrected here. we thank axel fehrenbach for pointing this out to us. in fact, we are using schwarzschild coordinates, here, while in , isotropic coordinates are used. this allows us to treat the case of m < as well and does not aect the asymptotic computations. center of mass and stcmc-foliations computing the stcmc-coordinate center of mass ). in order to check whether the stcmc-coordinate center of the c -asymptotically euclidean ini- tial data set (m t, gt, kt, t , jt ) converges, one needs to compute the stcmc-leaves and the coordinate averages z and check whether they con- verge as however, the proof of theorem asserts that cstcmc converges if and only if the coordinate expression given in converges, or in other words if and only if cstcmc  s s( )  = cb om  s s( )  + z  s s( )  converges as s , where we recall that, using e = m and kl = ij + trgt ktij, we know that zi  s s( )  = m s s( ) yi  kl ykyl s d = m s s( ) si  t t( , )  d + o = cos m ui + o. our spacetime correction term z thus precisely compensates for the di- vergence occurring in ccmc = cb om. hence the stcmc-coordinate center of the considered graphical slice converges to as desired.","Determining the coordinate center of an asymptotic foliation in the Schwarzschild spacetime depends on choosing appropriate coordinates.

"a well-designed interest point detector is supposed to effectively represent images across variations of scale and viewpoint changes, clutter background and occlusion , . for years, interest point detectors have been extensively studied and widely used in many applications , , , , . nevertheless, an open question remains about extracting the stable points under illumination variations. the hessian- laplace/afne , harris-laplace/afne , sift and surf detectors are built upon the derivatives of the gaussian lter. either the rst or the second derivative of the gaussian lter is used to compute the strength of the image local contrast. as the gaussian lter responds proportionally to the image local contrast, these detectors perform poorly in detecting low contrast structures even if these structures are stable under different variations and signicant in computer vision applications. moreover, these detectors are susceptible to abrupt structures and image noises. to mitigate the inuence caused by image noise and nearby image structures, a rank- ordered laplacian of gaussian lter is proposed in . however, such a detector still partial relies on the image local contrast. this research was carried out at the rapid-rich object search lab at the nanyang technological university, singapore. the rose lab is supported by the national research foundation, prime ministers ofce, singapore, under its idm futures funding initiative and administered by the interactive and digital media programme ofce. the authors are with the school of electrical and electronics engineering and with rapid-rich object search lab, nanyang technologi- cal university, singapore. (e-mail: miaozhenwei@gmail.com; exd- jiang@ntu.edu.sg; ekhyap@ntu.edu.sg). to address the problems caused by illumination changes particularly, image segmentation has been utilized in designing interest point detectors. for example, the mser , , pcbr and bplr detectors use the watershed- like segmentation algorithms to extract the image structures. however, these detectors performance is unsatisfactory under image blurring in which the boundaries of image structures are unclear . self-dissimilarity and self-similarity of im- age patches are used in susan , fast and self- similar detectors to alleviate the problems caused by light- ing variation. in particular, the susan and fast detectors use the number of pixels that are dissimilar from that in a region center to detect corners. the weakness of two detectors is that they are not scale-invariant and inefcient in detecting blob-like structures. although local pixel variance is adopted in to estimate the self-similarly, the robustness of this detector is uncertain when there are strong abrupt changes within the image patch. considering the above-mentioned limitations of existing detectors, this paper aims to develop a contrast invariant and noise resistant interest point detector. inspired by the recent work on the iterative truncated mean algorithms , , , , an adaptive ternary coding is proposed to adaptively encode the pixels into bright, dark and uncertain statues. the ternary status of each pixel in a local region is detected by the dynamic thresholds that are automatically computed by the itm algorithm. interest points are extracted from the blob signicance map that is measured by the number of bright and dark pixels. as expected, the proposed atc shows robustness to illumination variations and is effective in dealing with cluttered structures.","Interest point detectors aim to effectively represent images despite scale, viewpoint changes, background clutter, and occlusion.

illumination changes. in view of this, we propose to detect interest points using the bright/dark labels of pixels. an issue that needs to be addressed is how to differentiate and label the pixels as bright or dark ones. one way is to dichotomize the pixels into bright and dark ones by a certain threshold, which could be set by the mean or median value of the local region. take the image patch , as a zoom in from fig. ) as an example, the bright and dark pixels dichotomized by the median value are identied in fig. median is more robust to the outliers and abrupt variations than mean. however, the median-based threshold is sensitive to quantization error because of its inefciency in suppressing this type of noise. this may lead to unreliable labelling. to solve this problem, we propose to introduce a fuzzy label for the pixels that are not clear enough to be labelled into either bright or dark set. this results in our proposed adaptive ternary coding algorithm. b. adaptive ternary coding algorithm instead of using one threshold to binarize the pixels into bright or dark labels, a pixel intensity margin spanned by two thresholds is proposed to ternarize the pixels, as , if i h , if l < i < h , if i l . where i is the pixel intensity value, l and h are the lower and upper bounds for the pixel ternarization. pixel intensities that are close to the median value in a local region are labeled the uncertain ones to reduce their sensitivity to noise. properly choosing the two thresholds is essential in the ternarization. the two thresholds should be invariant to the illumination changes, and should be located on both sides of the median value to ensure the correctness of pixel labeling. let the half width of the margin spanned by l and h be = /, and the mean of l and h be = / choosing l and h is equivalent to choosing and . one solution for the ternary coding is setting equal to the median of the local region and equal to some xed threshold. however, this has two limitations: ) computing the median is time consuming and ) a xed threshold cannot adapt to the contrast changes. compared to the median, the mean of the pixel intensities in a local region is easier to be computed. by setting equal to the mean absolute deviation of the pixel intensities from the mean , the two thresholds l = and h = + are located on both sides of the median and invariant to the illumination changes. moreover, by iteratively truncating the extreme samples with the itm algorithm proposed in , , the mean of the truncated data starts from the mean and approaches to the median of the input data. meanwhile, the mad of the truncated data converges to zero , . as a result, these two boundaries l and h computed by the itm algorithm automatically converge to the median while keeping the median within the margin spanned by l and h. therefore, this margin ) separates the pixels into bright and dark ones and tolerates noise and quantization errors. given the advantage of the itm lter, we propose an adaptive ternary coding algorithm and a blob signicance measure based on the itm algorithm, which are presented as follows. let s and s be the central region and the corresponding peripheral ring of a lter mask centered at . for the blob detection, here both s and s are chosen as circle shape, and the radius of the outside ring is times of the inner one to make the area size of these two regions the same. two pixel sets centered at x are dened as i = {i|m s} and i = {i|m s}, where x is the region center and i is the pixel gray value at the location x m. in order to ensure that the two pixel sets i and i have the same effect on estimating the thresholds for pixel labeling, the weighted itm algorithm is adopted to make them have equivalently equal number of pixels. the pixel numbers n and n in these two sets i and i are used to weight the pixels in i and i, respectively. the proposed adaptive pixel ternary coding is shown in algorithm algorithm : adaptive pixel ternary coding for the proposed detector input: i, i, n = n + n, k = ; output: blob signicance b; do compute the weighted mean w = (n p i + n p i)/n; compute the weighted dynamic threshold w = (n p |i w| + n p |i w|)/n; k = k + , l = w w, u = w + w, compute the blob signicance b by , and truncate ii {i, i} by: ii = u, if ii > u l, if ii < l ii, otherwise ; while the stopping criterion cd is violated; the lower and upper bounds l and u in algorithm are used to ternarize the pixels into bright, uncertain or dark ones by , as shown in fig. a bright pixel is the one that is larger than the higher threshold. a dark pixel is the one that is smaller than the lower threshold. the blob structures have the attribute that the majority of bright pixels are concentrated in the inner region while the majority of the opposite ones in the surrounding region. as a result, we measure the blob signicance by the distribution of the bright and dark pixels. first, the dominances of bright/dark pixels in s and s are measured by the difference of the numbers of bright and dark pixels in the corresponding region. the bright and dark pixels are respectively labeled as and by and the uncertain pixels are labeled as therefore, the normalized dominance of the bright/dark pixels in s and s are n p , l, h) and n p , l, h), respectively, where l and h are the lower and upper bounds in the kth iteration. second, these two parts are linearly combined as the blob signicance in the kth iteration: b = n x , l, h) n x , l, h). from algorithm it is seen that the margin between the lower and upper bounds equals w. it monotonically decreases to zero by increasing the number of iterations . in the rst few iterations, the margin is large as only few extreme samples are truncated by the itm algorithm. by increasing the number of iterations, both the lower and higher thresholds converge to the median value of the local region. as a result, the margin between these two thresholds reduces. therefore, the number of pixels categorized into the intermediate group decreases. the blob signicance b ) is a function of the number of iterations k. the maximum value of |b| over k is selected as the blob signicance map for interest point detection, dened as b b with k = argmax k |). however, exhaustively searching the global peaks over all iterations is time-consuming. the following stopping criterions are used to allow that the global maximum value is achieved in most cases within a reasonable number of iterations. let i = i i, the corresponding weight set be w = {n, , n | {z } n times , n, , n | {z } n times } and the two sets separated by the weighted mean w be ih {ii|ii i, ii > w} and il {ii|ii i, ii w}. let wh and wl denote the summation of the weights of ih and il, respectively. one stopping criterion , which enables the truncated mean to be close to the weighted median, is to meet the condition c : |wh wl| max{n, n}. in some cases, after c is met, the amplitude of the blob sig- nicance b still increases because the number of pixels with uncertain status is still large. therefore, an additional constrain is applied: c : |b| |b|. the third condition is to limit the maximum number of iterations as c : k n, which is chosen from experiment. the truncating procedure of in algorithm is terminated if the following conditions is satised, as cd : c from we nd that the blob signicance value b is within the range . for a bright region, b > the maximum value of its blob signicance is similarly, a local region is dark if b < and the minimum value of its

"in recent years, there has been an increasing amount of lit- erature on providing theoretical results for neural networks. a considerable amount of work in this area focused on the case where a convolutional network with a single hidden layer is trained using gradient descent. for instance, shows that gradient descent achieves the global minimum (with high probability) for convolutional networks with one layer and no overlap when the distribution of the input is gaussian. also proves that the problem of learning this network is np- complete. zhang et. al propose a convex optimization ap- proach based on a low-rank relaxation using the nuclear norm regularizer . in , askari et al. consider neural net ob- jectives which are convex over blocks of variables. a num- ber of recent results considered the gradient descent method on the non-convex training objective, and proved that it re- covers the planted model parameters under distributional as- sumptions on the training data . we refer the reader to for other theoretical results regarding learning relu units and convolutional nets. our contributions can be summarized as follows. first, we propose a randomized convex relaxation of learning single hidden layer neural networks in the original parameter space. this should be contrasted with , where the convex pro- gram is in the lifted space of matrices, and is not guaranteed to nd the global optimum. our derivation also explains why di- rect relaxations fail and a randomized perturbation is needed. second, we prove that the relaxation obtains the global opti- mum under a planted model assumption with gaussian train- ing data with certain probability. our results are geometric in nature, and has a close connection to the phase transitions in compressed sensing , escape from a mesh phenomena in gaussian random matrices and sketch- ing . third, our numerical results highlight a phase transition, where the global optimum can be recovered when the number of samples exceeds a threshold that depends on the dimension of the lter and the number of hidden neu- rons. our approach provides a general framework for obtain- ing convex relaxations which can be used in other architec- tures such as soft-max classiers, autoencoders and recurrent nets.","Recent literature has focused on providing theoretical results for neural networks, particularly on training convolutional networks with a single hidden layer using gradient descent.

"as a result of the relaxation, the convex optimization problem in may not be a satisfactory approximation of the original problem, and may have more than one optimal solution. let us illustrate the case for the relu activation = +. the convex relaxation becomes prelu = min w,z n x i= zi (xt i w)+ , i = , , n = min w,z n x i= , zi xt i w , i = , , n zi , i = , , n where we have used the fact that + z holds if and only if u z and z. observe that w = and z = y is feasible in the constraint set of , and also minimizes the convex objective y z hence, the pair w = , z = y belongs to the set of optimal solutions of , regardless of the data x, , xn and labels y, , yn. let us dene was the solution to , and suppose that the optimal value is zero. note that the pair z = y = + and w = walso belongs to the set of optimal solutions. therefore, the set of optimal solutions to the convex program is not a singleton, and always contains the trivial solution, along with the optimal solution to . it is surprising that even in the idealized case where the labels are generated by y = +, and features are i.i.d. gaussian distributed, i.e., xi n, i = , , n, the above relaxation fails to recover the correct weight vector w. in contrast, it is possible to recover wusing a very simple procedure as long as n > d, and n is large enough. we can consider the subset of labels which are strictly positive, s = s i{,,} : yi>{i}, and attempt to solve for wusing the pseudoinverse via w = x sys . its straightforward to show that w = was long as |s| d and xs has full col- umn rank. for i.i.d. gaussian features, this holds with high probability when n is large enough.","The naive relaxation approach to approximating the original problem in convex optimization may not be satisfactory, potentially resulting in more than one optimal solution.

"in convex relaxations, relaxing the equality constraints into inequality constraints can lead to multiple spurious feasible points. it is clear that with the naive convex relaxation, we cant hope to recover the optimal solution to . in this sec- tion we will propose a randomly perturbed convex program aiming to recover the solution of the original problem. the reasoning behind optimizing a random objective is to ran- domly pick a solution among multiple feasible solutions. we will pick a random vector r distributed as n and solve w = arg min wrd, zrn z y + rt w , zi (xt i w) , i = , , n , where > is a small regularization parameter that controls the amount of random perturbation. for the relu activation, the above is a second-order cone program which can be solved efciently . the next theorem shows that a small random perturbation allows exact recovery of the global optimum as theorem let = max, the relu activation, xi n, i = , , n and the global minimum value of is p= , and is achieved by w. then, the solution of as is equal to the global minimizer wwith prob- ability cecd if n cd, where c, c, c are universal constants. this theorem essentially implies that a random perturbation to the objective is equally likely to return w = wor w = , which are the only extreme points asymptotically as n . proof sketch: plugging in the relu activation function = + we can express the optimization problem as via a linear program min rt w s.t. y = z, xw z , z . the pair z = y = + and w = ware optimal if + r = r cone xs . in other words, the response y is generated by a network such that y = (xt i w), i = , , n holds. this is a common assumption which is also used by many others in the literature, and sometimes referred as the teacher network assumption. the dual linear program is given by min u yt u xt u = r . optimality conditions for the primal-dual pair are as follows u : u , usc = , xt u = r , where s = s i{,,n} : xt i w>{i} is the subset of indices over {, , n} where the relu is active. this condition can be equivalently represented as a cone intersection r cone(xt s ) , where xs is the submatrix of x composed of the rows that are in s. without loss of generality, let us take w= e due to the rotation invariance of the i.i.d. gaussian distribution over the features. in this case, we have s = {i : xi > } and s is a random set independent of xij for j = parti- tioning r and xs into r = and xt s = [xs; x s], the cone condition reduces to r = xt sus, and r = (x s)t us . fixing r > and xs, the above condition can be stated as the nullspace-cone intersection null([x s r]) and [xt s; r]t = , us since [x s r] is an i.i.d. gaussian matrix, the nullspace-cone intersection probability can be lower-bounded by calculating the gaussian width of the cone   : [xt s; r]t = , us  . for r > , a calculation of the gaussian width yields o, which implies that for n cd, the probability of cone in- tersection is cecd conditioned on r noting that p = , we obtain the claimed result. convolutional nets and multiple neurons we now consider multiple neurons where each neuron re- ceives the output of a convolution. when the lter w is applied in a non-overlapping fashion, we need to solve the non-convex problem minw,c pn i=(yipk j= cj+), where xij rd/k is the jth d k-length block of the ith row of x. if we assume that c , then with- out loss of generality, we can instead solve the problem minw pn i=(yi pk j=+) this follows from the fact that cj+ = + for cj and therefore it is possible to implicitly include the parameter cj in the parameter w. we relax this non-convex problem the same way we did for the single neuron case and obtain the relaxed linear program as we let max zij,w rt w k x j= zij = yi, i = , , n zij xijw, {, , n} {, , k}. the dual of is given by min ij,v yt v ij vi, {, , n} {, , k} n x i= k x j= xt ijij = r, where rnk and v rn. dening the sets sj for j = , , k as sj = s i{,,n} : xijw>{i}, we can rewrite the equality constraint of as k x j= x isj xt ijij + k x j= x isc j xt ijij = r. substituting ij with vi + and multiplying both sides by w, we obtain k x j= x isj xijwvi + k x j= x isj xijw + k x j= x isc j xijwij = rt w. note that the rst term of the lhs of is equal to the objective of the dual (this follows from the denition that relu = for i sj), and the rhs is equal to the optimal value of the primal. for optimality, we must have the second and the third terms of the lhs to be zero since they are both nonpositive. this implies that ij = for all i sj, and ij = vi for all i sj. hence, the optimality condition is that there exists v rn such that k x j= xt sj,jvsj = r, and vsj , j = , , k, where vsj is a |sj|-dimensional vector with entries from v corresponding to the indices sj. to reach an equivalent con- dition to that will be useful in our analysis, let us dene the sets ri for each sample i = , , n, which indicate the indices j for which the ith sample satises xijw> : ri = [ j{,,k} : isj {j} the condition is satised if and only if r falls inside the cone dened by the vectors p jri xt ij, i = , , n, that is, r cone [ i{,,n} ( x jri xt ij ) . now, we are ready to show that is satised with proba- bility cecd if n cd, where c, c, and c are con- stants (not necessarily the same constants for the single neu- ron case in theorem ). assuming x and r both have i.i.d. n entries, and observing that we can consider only the samples with |ri| = , we can use the same reasoning in theorem the expected number of samples with |ri| = is n ( )k = n k . for a xed k, the number of samples with |ri| = is linear in n, and the constant term k may as well be hidden in the constant c now using the same argument from theorem , it is straightforward to show that the success probability is cecd for n cd.","In convex relaxations, relaxing equality constraints to inequality constraints can result in multiple feasible solutions. A novel approach proposed involves a randomly perturbed convex program to recover the optimal solution of the original problem by optimizing a random objective.

"for n we denote by m the set of all bounded symbols m l, smooth away from the origin and satisfying the classical marcinkiewcz-mikhlin- h ormander condition |m| || for every rn\{} and suciently many

operator under the condition . note that in the only singularity for the symbol m is at the origin. in , muscalu considered some types of symbols having ag singularities. more precisely, in the trilinear case, the symbol m is a product of two symbols in m and m respectively, i.e, m = mm for m m, m m satisfying | m| ++ | m| + for every , , r and suciently many indices , and . dene tm,m := z r

lp l lp lr and lp lp llr are true. moreover, for the above theorem, the estimates like lt l llt or l l llare false, and these can be checked by setting one of the symbols to be identically moreover, the method in can be applied when studying the adjoints of those operators. also, when < p, p, p , miyachi and tomita in proved the boundedness of on hardy and bmo spaces. the main purpose of this paper is to study the lr estimates for the bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with ag singularity as dened in , as well as the corresponding bi-parameter trilinear pseudo-dierential variants. we consider the multipliers m bm and m bm satisfying the following conditions: | m| ++ ++ , | m| + + , bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol for every = , = , = r r and all multi-indices = , = and = . our main theorems are as follows. theorem . for f, g, h s, the bi-parameter operators tm,m := z r mm f g heixddd would map lp lp lp lr for < p, p, p < with /p+/p+/p = /r and < r < , if one assumes that the operators z r mm f g heixddd, satisfy the same h older type estimates, where m m and m m are two one-parameter symbols. in fact, we will reduce to a sum of fourier multipliers, each with dierent types of symbols; for some of these operators we prove h older type estimates, and the remaining operators are treated under an additional assumption about symbols of form . while the helicoidal method of can be used to treat certain of the operators in our reduction, it does not give the boundedness of . we conjecture that h older-type estimates for these operators are true. more details are in section and remark the above theorem indicates that providing estimates for the operator are the fundamentally new obstacles in obtaining estimates for the operator . in fact, the proof of this theorem shows that the study of the bi-parameter ag mul- tiplier can be essentially reduced to the study of classical bi-parameter mul- tilinear fourier multipliers like as well as the multipliers with tensor product symbols like . as it turns out, estimates for the operator are of interest even in restricted function spaces. recently, muscalu and zhai , and see also ) proved the following estimates for under a certain tensor product assumption. theorem . let g = gg, h = hh, p+ p+ p = p + q + q = r, and < r < . then maps lp lp x(lq x) lp x(lq

as in can be used to oer an alternative proof for some of these mixed norm estimates as above under the tensor product setting. we include some details in appendix b. to obtain the mixed norm estimates involving l, it seems that further ideas are required and that the arguments of are essential. in fact, our argument, which gives an alternative proof of the above theorem , also allows us to establish the following weighted mixed norm estimates whose proof will be given in appendix c. we will denote ap as the class of muckenhoupt weights below and we refer the reader to appendix c for denition. theorem . let g = g g, h = h h assume that w , w ap, w ap, w ap, w aq, w aq, then maps lp(w w )lp x(w )(lq x(w ))lp x(w )(lq x(w )) lr for < p, p, p, q, q < , < r < and p + p + p = p + q + q = r, where w = (w )r/p (w )r/p (w )r/p, w = (w )r/p (w )r/q (w )r/q in particular, by taking w = w = w = w amin , w = w = w = w amin , maps lplp x(lq x)lp x(lq x) lr. now we state our result for the corresponding bi-parameter trilinear pseudo- dierential operators. the one-parameter case was studied in . let tab := z r ab f g heixddd, where f, g, h s, and the bi-parameter smooth symbols a, b bs , satisfy the following conditions |l xl x a| ++ ++ , |l xl x b| + + . for every x = , = , = , = r r and all multi- indices = , = and = . we will prove the following estimate when assuming the estimates in theorem theorem . the operators tab dened as map lp lp lp lr for < p, p, p < with /p + /p + /p = /r and < r < , provided that the multiplier operator dened in satises the same lr estimate. bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol the proof of the lr estimates for the bi-parameter trilinear ag fourier multipliers of theorem proceeds by reducing to a decomposition into multipliers based on the support on the frequency variables, then studying the h older type lr estimates for each. such a reduction is partly inspired by earlier work in both the single- parameter and bi-parameter settings, for instance, . to prove theorem , we reduce the bi-parameter trilinear pseudo-dierential operator to a localized version. then by taking advantage of the paraproducts studied in , but with all dyadic intervals having lengths at most , and theorem , we prove the h older estimates for the localized operator. this is theorem . the rest of the paper is organized as follows. in section , we collect some notation and denitions used in the paper. section contains the proof of theorem . in section , we show that the main theorem can be reduced to an estimate for a localized operator . in section , we give the proof of theorem . in fact, the localized operator will be written as certain bi-parameter paraproducts, where all the involved dyadic intervals have lengths at most this allows us to avoid the more complicated size and energy estimates used in to deal with paraproducts. acknowledgement. the authors are grateful to camil muscalu for pointing out an error in

"before giving the proof of theorem , we give an example where the operator we consider plays a role. this is one of the possible motivations for the study of such operators. the details are included in the appendix a. let f, g, h s, and for , > dene [ d h = h, [ d h = h, u = r in , it was proved that the boundedness of the bi-parameter bilinear fourier multiplier in theorem implies the following leibniz rule. d d lr d d flpglq + d flpd glq +d flpd glq + flpd d glq, where /pi + /qi = /r, < pi, qi for i = , , , and max   +, +  < r < . then its very natural and interesting to ask if such bi-parameter leibniz rule holds when there is higher complexity of the dierentiation. in particular, a leibniz estimate for an expression like the following relies on our theorem: d d  f d d  lr, where max   +, +, +, +  < r < . first note that an iteration of results in the inequality d d  f d d  lr d d flpd d lt + d flpd d+ lt +d flpd+ d lt + flpd+ d+ lt, where /r = /pi+/ti for i = , , , however, this argument using requires ti > , while the ideal restriction is ti > , since we expect to further expand the dierentiation on gh. thus, its a non-trivial question to get a general leibniz rule for , that is d d  f d d  lr d d flp d d glq hls + d d flp d glq d hls +d d flp d glq d hls + d d flp glq d d hls +d flp d d+ glq hls + d flp d glq d+ hls guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang +d flp d+ glq d hls + d flp glq d d+ hls +d flp d+ d glq hls + d flp d+ glq d hls +d flp d glq d+ hls + d flp glq d+ d hls +flp d+ d+ glq hls + flp d+ glq d+ hls +flp d+ glq d+ hls + flp glqd+ d+ hls, where /pi+/qi+/si = /r, < pi, qi, si < for i = , . . . , and max   +, +, +, +  < r < . it turns out, we can write d d  f d d  as a sum of essentially two types of fourier multipliers. more precisely, we can write d d  f d d  = tm,m + tm,m, where tm,m is the operator in theorem , and tm,m = z r mm f g hddd, with m, m bm. thus, in order to get the leibniz estimate, we just need to show the h older lr estimate for each of the above two operators implies those pieces in . now lets take a quick look at how the estimate in theorem is associated with the terms appearing in . we indicate some key steps here, and more details can be found in appendix a. let s be a schwartz function satisfying supp {/ |u| } and = x kz b k, u = now f g h can be rewritten by using f g h = x j,j b j b j f ! x k,k b k b k g ! x l,l b l b l h ! . then by using a sequence of appropriate reductions, it turns out that our goal d d  f d d  can be written as a summation of terms that includes, for example, d d x j,j  )  d d   ! bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol = x j,j    d d f   j j   d d     j j  . where d d has the form x kj x kj  d d g   k k  )    k k  . here for i = , , ki ji means ki < ji , ki = p liki li, and ki may actually represent p kiliki+ li. moreover, b ki = b ki| u ki |i, b ki = b ki| ki u |i, and represents the tensor product. in fact, the expression is a fourier multiplier with symbol having the form mm, where m bm and m bm respectively. then one can see the boundedness of in theorem implies the bound d d flp d d glq hls, which appears on the right hand side of . to see how to get the other terms in from the boundedness of , we need to look at the terms that are similar to , which appear in the process of reduction. here we just give one more example, d d x j,j  )  d d   ! = x j,j    d f   j j   d d+  j j     j j  . where d d+ has the form x kj x kj  d+ g  k k   d h  k k    k k  . as before, corresponds to an operator with the symbol mm, and its boundedness gives d flp d+ glq d hls however, there are still terms in the reduction that can not be covered by the operators . such terms appear when, for example, j k l, j k l in , and they actually correspond to the operator tm,m thus, in order to obtain the nal goal , one also needs the h older type lr estimate for tm,m note that the bi-parameter symbol mm is more singular than the one in tm,m, and thus it is a more challenging task to obtain h older type estimates for the guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang associated operator. overcoming this obstacle is another issue for future research in this subject.","The section presents a Leibniz rule related to bi-parameter bilinear Fourier multipliers, showcasing its applications and extensions to higher-order differentiations.

"to prove this theorem, we start with the decom- position and reduction of the symbols m := mm we take smooth homogeneous functions and on r\{} such that + = and supp {||v| + |w| |u|}, supp {||v| + |w| |u|} for some small . then we decompose m as m = m + ) + ) = m + m +m + m := m, + m, + m, + m, obviously m,m satises the condition | m) | ++ ++ , and the desired estimate follows from the multilinear version of theorem . m, and m, satisfy the similar conditions. for example, | m) | x + = + = + + + ++ , note that such a condition is stronger than what m,m satises, since the estimate for the second parameter is in a classical type. more precisely, | m) | x + = + = x + = + = + + + bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol + + + . thus, if suces to study m,m we choose b s such that supp b {u r : / |u| }, and x jz b j := x jz b ( u j ) = for u = we dene by b = x k= b for u = , b = , which implies supp b {u r : |u| }, and b = for |u| we also set = x jz b b b . note that m and = , = on supp m, since it is sucient to consider m,m, we now use m to represent m, from taylors theorem, we have: m = x + <n ! ! m +n x + =n ! ! z n mdt, and m = x + <n ! ! m +n x + =n ! ! z n mds. this gives the expression m = x + <n x + <n ! ! ! ! m guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang +n x + <n x + =n ! ! ! ! z n mdt +n x + =n x + <n ! ! ! ! z n mdt +n x + =n x + =n ! ! ! ! z z nn mdsdt := m, + m, + m, + m, these computations imply that our original symbol mm can actu- ally be reduced to  m, + m, + m, + m,  m in the following subsections, we deal with each of these four types of symbols. . the symbol m, m a straightforward calculation shows that |  m, m  | n ||n+ n ||n+ , which means that |  m, m  | ++ ++ for + n and + n for n suciently large. therefore this symbol also falls within the scope of theorem . . the symbol m, m, m, m as in the argument for m, , by a direct calculation one can see that m, m and m, m satisfy the classical restriction on the second and rst parameter respectively. more precisely, for example, |  m, m  | x + = + = + + + ++ , bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol for + n, where n suciently large. note that this is stronger than the condition that m, m satises, i.e., |  m, m  | x + = + = x + = + = + + + + + + . thus, we only need to consider the symbol m, m . the symbol m, m to handle the symbol m, m, we use the standard decomposition for m we denote by b := p k= b , so that b s and supp b {u r : |u| }. then we can write = x k,kz x k,kz b b (k ) b b =  x |kk| + x kk> + x kk<  x |kk| + x kk> + x kk<  b b (k ) b b = x k,kz   b b + b b + b b    b b + b b + b b  applying the above decomposition to m, by symmetry it suces to consider the following cases: m, = x k,kz m b b b b m, = x k,kz m b b b b m, = x k,kz m b b b b m, = x k,kz m b b b b . guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang we now rewrite these using their fourier expansions. for example, m, = x k,kz x n,nz x n ,n z c, k,k,n,n ,n,n ein k ei n k ein k ei n k b k b k b k b k, where sup k,kz |c, k,k,n,n ,n,n | m( + |n | + |n |)m for suciently large m > moreover,for any index n and n z we denote by b ,n = ueinu b , b ,n = uei n u b , b ,n = ueinu b . then we have m, = x k,kz x n,nz x n ,n z c, k,k,n,n ,n,n k( + )k( + ) b ,n b ,n b ,n b ,n m, = x k,kz x n,nz x n ,n z c, k,k,n,n ,n,n k( + )k( + ) b ,n b ,n b ,n b ,n m, = x k,kz x n,nz x n

k,k,n,n ,n,n | m( + |n | + |n |)m. in similar fashion, for m, in , we denote m , , , := ! ! ! ! m note that for any indices , there holds | m , , , | ||(+ + )||(+ + ), bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol which means we can expand in fourier series to write as: m , , , b b = x l,lz c , , , j,j,l,l j( + )j( + ) b ,l b ,l, where b ,l = einu b , b ,l = einu b for u, v r are dened as before, and sup j,j |c,,, j,j,l,l | mm. then if we denote by d = + and d = + , and put everything together, we have that m, m = x c,dd b ,l( j ) b ,l( j )b ( j)b ( j) b ( j)b ( j) b ,n( k ) b ,n( k ) b ,n ( k ) b ,n ( k ) + x c,dd b ,l( j ) b ,l( j )b ( j)b ( j) b ( j)b ( j) b ,n( k ) b ,n( k ) b ,n ( k )b ,n ( k ) + x c,dd b ,l( j ) b ,l( j )b ( j)b ( j) b ( j)b ( j) b ,n( k )b ,n( k ) b

j,j,l,l ci,i k,k,n,n ,n,n for all the four pairs as above. note that when j k < or j k < , each of the four parts in must be zero. actually, if we take a look at the expressions in , for example, x c,dd b ,l( j ) b ,l( j )b ( j)b ( j) b ( j)b ( j) b ,n( k )b ,n( k )b ,n ( k ) b ,n ( k ), guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang we can see actually b ( j) b ,n( k ) = , since they have disjoint supports. more precisely, supp b ( j) { : || j}, b ,n( k ) { : k || k+}, supp b ( j) supp b ,n( k ) = if j k < other terms are handled similarly. therefore, we just need to consider the case j k and j k moreover, when jk , b ( j) = on supp b ,n( k )supp b ,n( k ) and b ( j) = on supp b ,n( k )supp b ,n( k ). further, when < j k < , one can see that the summation of the terms involving , , gives a multiplier in m. the same argument works for the other half of variables , , as well based on the similar choice of k, j due to the decay in the coecients aj,j := c , , , j,j,l,l , bk,k := ci,i k,k,n,n ,n,n , we can x l, l, n, n, n , n and only take the summation over j, j, k, k and without loss of generality we can assume |aj,j| , |bk,k| thus, when j k and j k , the above multipliers belong to bm and theorem gives us the desired estimate. so we only need to con- sider the case jk , jk , and the cases jk , jk and j k , j k correspond to the estimates like and . for the reduction in , one will see later what really matters there is the type of those b and b functions, i.e, whether is contained in the supports of functions. we call these functions type and type functions respectively. because of that, we can simplify the notations for operators in as below, where we also denote by di = i + i < n for i = , m d,d = x jk jk aj,jbk,kdd b ( j )c e ( j ) b ( k ) b ( k )c e ( k )c e ( k

)c e ( k )c e ( k ), m d,d = x jk jk aj,jbk,kdd b ( j )c e ( j ) b ( k )b ( k )c e ( k )c e ( k ). here b i, b , b e i, c e satisfy supp b i, supp b e i {u | |u| }, i = , , supp b , supp c e {u | |u| }, supp b , supp c e {u | |u| }. as previously mentioned, because of the type of the functions, we do not dis- tinguish between b i and b e i , between b and c e , and we denote them to be b and b respectively. but note that b , b are dierent from the ones in and . and we use the notations d jf = b ( j ) f, d skf = b ( k ) f. then nally we reduce our original problem to the study of the following cases t d,d = x jk jk aj,jbk,kddjjf kkg kkh t d,d = x jk jk aj,jbk,kddjjf kkg kskh t d,d = x jk jk aj,jbk,kddjjf kkg skskh guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang t d,d = x jk jk aj,jbk,kddjjf kskg skkh note the fact that in t i d,d , the support for each of the fourier trans- forms of , , is contained in {|u| k, |u| k}. thus the fourier transform of t i d,d (i = , , , ) is supported in {|u| j, |u| j} for xed j, j moreover, from the argument below, one can see it suces to consider the case for d = d = since j k , j k . the lr boundedness of h older type. in this subsection we study the lplplp lr estimate for < p, p, p < for the operators t i d,d . . d, d > the approach for the case d, d > works for all t i d,d, . consider t d,d for example, with other cases treated similarly. since the support of the fourier transform of t d,d for xed j, j is included in {|u| j, |u| j}, there holds t d,dlr { x j,jz aj,jjjf   j x k= j x k= bk,kdd kkg kskh  } lr { x j,jz aj,jjjf }  sup k,k

. d = d = note that for d > and d = , or d = and d > , we can treat the decay factors bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol d or d as uniform constants. that means they are particular cases of d = d = for the case d = d = , in we have = = = = here we consider t d,d, and one can check the following argument is valid for the other three operators. we write the the lr norm of t , as x jk jk aj,jbk,kjjf kskg skkh lr = x k,kz bk,kkskg skkh x j,j=k,k+ aj,jjjf lr we rst consider the part p j,j=k,k+ jjf. in one-parameter case, since supp b j {j || j+} , we have supp x j=k+ b j {k+ ||}. now we choose a function such that supp b k {|| k} and b k = on {|| k}. note that b k = on supp x j=k+ b j, b k = on {|| k}. thus, x j=k+ b j = ( b k)( x j=k+ b j) = ( b k)( x jz b j k+ x j= b j) = ( b k)( x jz b j k+ x j=k b j) = ( b k)( x jz b j x jk b j) = ( b k)( x jz b j c e k). here we use the fact ( b k)(pk j=b j)= since they have disjoint supports. that means x j=k+ jf = x jz j e k ! f. guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang now we come back to the bi-parameter case. in the following arguments, we will omit the uniformly bounded constants aj,j and bk,k in for simplicity, since one can see they do not play an essential role in our argument x j=k+ x j=k+ jjf = x jz j e k ! x jz j e k ! f = x j,jz jj e k x jz j x jz j e k + e k e k ! f := + o + o + o) we consider o rst. using o, our operator becomes i : = x k,kz kskg skkh o lr x k,kz kskg skkh ls o lp glp hlp o lp , where the rst inequality follows from the h olders inequality with /p+/p = /s, and the second inequality follows from the classical bilinear bi-parameter multiplier boundedness. using sksko, we have ii : = x k,kz kskg skkh sksko lr glp hlp o lp , where the inequality follows from the classical trilinear bi-parameter boundedness. then our desired h older type estimate would hold since the classical linear theory gives olp = x j,jz jjf lp flp , < p < . bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol note that actually i corresponds to the boundedness of the following trilinear fourier multiplier. ti = z x k,k b kb kb k b k b o g heixddd = z x k b kb k ! x k b k b k ! b o g heixddd = z mm b o g heixddd = z mm g heixdd o this trilinear operator has a special bilinear symbol mm, which is actually the product of o and a bilinear bi-parameter multiplier. then we can take advantage of the h olders inequality and a bilinear bi-parameter result. more precisely, tilr z mm g heixdd ls olp glp hlp f lp . similarly, the boundedness ii corresponds to the trilinear fourier multiplier tii = z x k,k b kb k b kb kb k b k b o g heixddd = z x k b k b kb k ! x k b kb k b k ! b o g heixddd = z mm b o g heixddd. note that this is a standard bi-parameter trilinear fourier multiplier, and thats why its h older type estimate holds. then we consider the terms like sko in iii : = x k,kz kskg skkh sko lr guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang similar as before, this corresponds to the following trilinear operator tiii = z x k,k b k b kb kb k b k b o g heixddd = z x k b k b kb k ! x k b k b k ! b o g heixddd = z mm b o g heixddd. remark note that this trilinear multiplier has a symbol m = mm, where one variable is missing for the second parameter, i.e., the function f is not actually transformed in the second variable. such a symbol can be interpreted as an intermediate case between the previous i and ii, and thats why we conjecture that h older type estimates should hold for operator. if we make the assumption that this operator is bounded, we have the following. tiiilr glp hlp o lp glp hlp f lp now we consider o we still consider the three parts o, sksko and sko recall o =  e k e k  f. thus, with o, we have i : = x k,kz kskg skkh o lr = x k,kz kskg skkh e k e kf lr glp hlp f lp , where the estimate follows from the classical trilinear bi-parameter multiplier bound- edness, as what we argued for ti with sksko, ii : = x k,kz kskg skkh sksko lr bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol = x k,kz kskg skkh sksk e k e kf lr recall that supp b k {|| k}, supp b k {k || k+}, supp c e k {k || k+} thus, we can write sksk e k e kf = e k e kf, where e kf =  c e k f  =  b kc e k f  . note that supp c e k {k || k}. then the estimate ii : = x k,kz kskg skkh sksko lr = x k,kz kskg skkh e k e kf lr glp hlp f lp follows from the classical trilinear bi-parameter boundedness. with sko, we have iii : = x k,kz kskg skkh sko lr = x k,kz kskg skkh sk e k e kf lr = x k,kz kskg skkh e k e kf lr glp hlp f lp where we use the same trick sk e k e kf = e k e kf. guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang then we consider the last situation left in , which is o using the same argument as above, we can write o = e k x jz j = e k x jz jf ! e k x jz jf ! e ksk x jz jf ! + e ksk x jz jf ! := e kq e kq e kskq + e kskq, where obviously qlp = x jz jflp flp now we consider the lr norm of . x k,kz kskg skkh o lr = x k,kz kskg skkh  e kq e kq e kskq + e kskq  lr x k,kz kskg skkh e kq lr + x k,kz kskg skkh e kq lr + x k,kz kskg skkh e kskq lr + x k,kz kskg skkh e kskq lr glp hlp qlp glp hlp flp where the estimates for the last two terms in are given by the classical trilinear bi-parameter boundedness, while the rst two terms correspond to situation iii in remark , where in the second parameter we just have a bilinear multiplier. moreover, this approach should work for all of the operators t , t , t and t , since more -type functions appear in t , t and t in fact, these four operators dier from each other in the decomposition for g and h part. however, what they have in common is that for each parameter, there is at least one -function or , and this is the key in our argument. thus, the boundedness of would follow, as long as the assumption in remark is true. bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol","The text discusses the reduction and decomposition of symbols to prove a theorem. It involves various calculations and transformations of symbols using decomposition techniques, Taylor's theorem, and Fourier series expansions. The analysis results in the reduction of the original symbol to a simpler form, leading to the study of different types of symbols. The process involves handling classical restrictions on parameters and utilizing bilinear and trilinear multipliers. The text also covers the estimation and boundedness of various operators, including trilinear Fourier multipliers, using techniques such as H older type estimates and classical multiplier properties. Additionally, it explores the interactions between different types of functions and their role in the overall analysis. Ultimately, the discussion focuses on the reduction of the original problem to the study of specific cases for different operators based on the types of functions involved."
"in this section we give the idea to prove theorem ; the strategy is to reduce the pseudo-dierential operator to a localized version. from now on we will redene the functions that were used in the previous sections: , , and . first pick two sequences of smooth functions nz , ( m)mz such that supp n and supp m satisfying x nz n = , x mz m = , where r then we can decompose the operator tab in as tab = x n,mz t n,m ab where t n,m ab := tabn m. suppose we can prove the estimate t n,m ab r f rnmpg rnmph rnmp, where rnm = injm, in = , jm = and rnm = in jm as dened in . then our main theorem can be proved by the following estimate tabr ( x n,mz t n,m ab r r)/r ( x n,mz f rnmr pg rnmr ph rnmr p)/r ( x n,mz f rnmp p)/p( x n,mz g rn,mp p)/p( x n,mz h rnmp p)/p fpgphp thus, we only need to prove . consider that for a xed n, m z, we have t n,m ab = z r a n mb n m n m f g heixddd, where n, m are smooth functions supported on the intervals , , which equal on the supports of n, m respectively. then we rewrite the symbols a n m and b n m by using fourier series with respect to the x variable guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang a n m = x l,lz al,lei b n m = x l ,l z bl ,l ei(xl +xl ), where al,l = z r a n meidx, bl ,l = z r b n mei(xl +xl )dx. by taking advantage of conditions we have |,, ,, ,, ,, al,l| |)m ++ ++ |, , , , bl ,l | ( + |(l , l )|)m + + for a large number m and all indices , , , , , note that the decay in l, l, l , l allows one to take summation t n,m ab = p l,l,l ,l t n,m,l,l,l ,l ab , where t n,m,l,l,l ,l ab = ( z r al,lbl ,l f g heixddd)n m that means we only need to consider the case for l, l, l , l = for simplicity, we denote it by t n,m,, ab = ( z r ab f g heixddd)n m, where the symbols a, b satisfy the following conditions |,, ,, ,, ,, a| ++ ++ |, , , , b| + + for all indices , , , , , bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol by translation invariance, we only need to prove the following localized result for n, m = theorem . for < p, p, p < , and /p + /p + /p = /r the operator t ab := t ,,, ab = ( z r ab f g heixddd) has the following boundedness property t abr f rpg rph rp, where , are smooth functions supported within i = , r = i i and a, b satisfy the conditions . in short, the proof of theorem can be reduced to the above theorem, and in the next section we will show how to deal with the operator in .","The section discusses the reduction of Theorem ?? by introducing the strategy of reducing the pseudo-differential operator to a localized version. This involves redefining functions used in previous sections and decomposing the operator. The main theorem is proven using an estimate involving specific conditions on the symbols a and b. The proof of the main theorem relies on proving a localized result for bi-parameter trilinear Fourier multipliers, and the section ends by hinting that the next section will address how to deal with the operator further."
"in this section we prove theorem . the rst step is to use fourier series as before and rewrite the operator . here we make use of the fact that the conditions do not involve any singularity. that means that there is no problem when the variables , , are close to zero. more precisely, we can modify the littlewood-paley decomposition as follows. let be a schwartz function such that supp and = on , and let be the schwartz function satisfying := , and let c k = b and d = . note that = x k c k, where supp for k the key thing here is that one does not have to decompose the identity near moreover, for any smooth function supported on a closed interval, we write to denote a smooth function that is supported on a slightly larger interval and equal to on the support of . actually, we will use to represent either a function or a function. for simplicity, let us consider the single-parameter case rst, i.e. temporarily assume , , r. by expanding in fourier series as before, it can be seen to be sucient to replace the symbols a and b with a = x k c kc kc k + , guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang where at least one of the families (c k)k, (c k)k, and (c k)k is supported away from the origin. similarly, b = x k c kc k + , where at least one of the families (c k)k, (c k)k is supported away from the origin. now we can replace the symbol ab by ab =   x k c k c k c k +   x k c k c k +  ( x k c k c k c k x k c k c k) + ( x k c k c k c k) +( x k c k c k) + = ( x k c k c k c k x kk c k c k) +( x k c k c k c k x kk c k c k) +( x k c k c k c k x kk c k c k) +( x k c k c k c k) +( x k c k c k) + := , first note that it is not possible that k k, which implies that f = , since at least one of (c k)k, (c k)k is supported away from the origin. to take care of other terms, the essential idea here is to compare the sizes of the supports of , , , as we have done before. roughly speaking, one can consider the following two cases: case i: when {|| c} for some constant c, i.e. the terms g, k, l, such terms correspond to the following estimate of the symbol | ab| ++ . case ii: when {|| c}, i.e. the terms e, g correspond to the operators in denition - see for more details. bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol with the above argument, we can simplify to e + f + g + h + k + l e + g, where we use e to represent case ii, and g to represent case i. now we come back to the bi-parameter case. by doing the decomposition as above in each parameter , i.e. and , one should have four cases to estimate. more precisely, we can replace ab by ab correspondingly, the localized operator is changed to t ab =   z r ab f g heixddd  =   z r f g heixddd  := t e,e, ab + t e,g, ab + t g,e, ab + t g,g, ab . . estimates for t g,g, ab . first consider t g,g, ab , recall t

the proof of theorem , see . . estimates for t e,e, ab . recall e e =  x k c k c k c k x kk c k c k  guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang  x k c k c k c k x k k c k c k  , where for each l = k, k, k , k , at least one of the families ( b l )l and ( b l )l is type. and t e,e, ab =  z reix f g hddd  , where we have removed multipliers a, b by using fourier series as before. we now give two lemmas for single parameter operators when x, , , r, which will be used later. t e =: t e, ab := ( z r( x k c k c k c k)( x kk c k c k) f g heixddd), where x, , , r. from , we can show t e can be decomposed into para- products. before we state this result, we introduce some notations which are needed in the statement of the result. then we introduce some notations that will appear in the next lemma. we take t and b i from and in denition for positive integers l and k , let t l,k = x ii |i| f, l, i b,l i,k, l, i l, i with b,l i,k = x jj k| j|| i| |j| g, l, j h, l, j l, j . the functions (l,k i )k=,, in t l,k and the functions (k i)k=,, in are of the same types , and so are the functions (l,k j )k=,, in and the functions (k j)k=,, in. note the only dierence between them is the dependence on l. in fact, l, i could be (b il), but fortunately, this does not change the types of those functions. in this sense, l will not play an important role in our estimates. for simplication, we omit this dependence on l for all the expressions in the rest of the work. for a large positive integer m, let t m,k be a fourier multiplier operator with m m,k satisfying the condition | m m,k| ++ ++ bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol for suciently many indices , , . for t and t l,k in , , all the dyadic intervals have lengths at most for all k , l m with these notations, we are ready to state the following lemma . dene t e as in , then we can write t e = t + m x l= x k= lt l,k + x k= mt m,k proof. one can follow the work closely, where the taylor expansions of proper functions are used to get such forms of paraproducts. the only two statements we need to show are that all the dyadic intervals there have lengths at most one and the decay number in the denominator from . in fact both of them follow from the fact k, k in . some more remarks for t l,k and t m,k are given below. remark t l,k: for each k, one can see t l,k and t are dened in very similar forms, and that means t l,k can be treated in the same way as t, since what really matters in the proof is the forms of paraproducts. more precisely, the bound of t l,k is actually independent of k, and then the factor kl allows us to take the summation over k thus, we will only deal with t here, and one can easily get a similar argument for the t l,k part. t m,k: the condition actually guarantees the estimate t m,kr kfpgphp, see . by picking m to be suciently large, we are able to take the sum- mation over k for mt m,k now we return to the bi-parameter case. first consider t e,e, ab . combining the ideas and the proof in those two lemmas , one can check t e,e, ab t e,e, , + t e,e, ,m, m,k +t e,e, m m,k, + t e,e, m m,k,m, m,k , where the denitions of the four operators will be given below. guozhen lu, jill pipher, and lu zhang first lets see the simplest case, which is t e,e, m m,k,m, m,k = ( z r m m,km, m,keix f g hddd) , where the symbols m m,k, m, m,k are dened as in lemma . in this case we can ignore k as discussed in remark and clearly the desired estimate follows from theorem . then we consider t e,e, , . t e,e, , := ( x ii ii |i| |i| f, i ib i,i, i i i i) with b i,i = x jj ,jj | j|| i| | j|| i| |j| |j| g, j jh, j j j j, where the families (j i)ii, (j i)ii are dened as (j i)ii , and the families (j j)ij , (j j)jj are dened as (j j)jj in denition taking advantage of that |i|, |i| , we can split t e,e, , = {( x ii ii + x ic ii + x ii ic + x ic ic ) |i| |i| f, i ib i,i, i i i i} = t e,e , , + t e,e , , + t e,e , , + t e,e , , . we start with t e,e , , . consider the following decompositions f = x n,n z finin , g = x n,n z ginin , h = x n,n z hinin then we can write t e,e , , = bi-parameter trilinear fourier multipliers with flag symbol x n,n x n,n

|n | > the power m, m can give a decay for i, i, and consequently a decay for j, j as well since i j , i j now we take the summation x |n|> |n |> x n,n,n ,n z t e,e , , (f in in , g in in , h in in )r

the fact for any n z and large integer l, there holds l in i when |n| or |n | things are dierent. say |n| , in this situation, the terms like ( + dist |i| )m in wont give us a decay factor on i, which means we will have trouble taking the summation over dyadic intervals i. actually the decay factors from other terms are with respect to j which cant help since i j. and the same problem exists for i, j as well. this is actually where such paraproducts behave dierently from the classical ones. in the classical case only one class of dyadic intervals is involved, but here we have i and j, i and j, where the decay factors coming from either class might not be used for the other one. we will make use of theorem here. without loss of generality, we assume both |n| and |n | now the goal is guozhen

large integers. also, by m(+|n m|)ml/l/ m(+|n |)m, m(+|n m|)ml/l/ m(+|n |)m, where m can be suciently large. that means when dealing with the paraproducts, we can go back to the original form of

than the one in t e,e, , and there is only one class of dyadic intervals on the second parameter in the above paraproducts. that means one can mimic the proof for t e,e, , to get the desired estimate,

"arxiv:v dec generalized dix equation and analytic treatment of normal-moveout velocity for anisotropic media vladimir grechka,, ilya tsvankin, and jack k. cohen center for wave phenomena, colorado school of mines, golden, co - and currently at marathon oil company despite the complexity of wave propagation in anisotropic media, reection moveout on conven- tional common-midpoint spreads is usually well described by the normal-moveout velocity dened in the zero-spread limit. in their recent work, grechka and tsvankin showed that the azimuthal dependence of nmo velocity generally has an elliptical shape and is determined by the spatial derivatives of the slowness vector evaluated at the cmp location. this formalism is used here to develop exact solutions for normal-moveout velocity in anisotropic media of arbitrary symmetry. for the model of a single homogeneous layer above a dipping reector, we obtain an explicit nmo expression valid for all pure modes and any orientation of the cmp line with respect to the reector strike. the inuence of anisotropy on normal-moveout velocity is absorbed by the slowness components of the zero-oset ray (along with the derivatives of the vertical slowness with respect to the horizontal slownesses) quantities that can be found in a straightforward way from the christoel equation. if the medium above a dipping reector is horizontally stratied, the eective nmo velocity is determined through a dix-type average of the matrices responsible for the interval nmo ellipses in the individual layers. this generalized dix equation provides an analytic basis for moveout inversion in vertically inhomogeneous, arbitrary anisotropic media. for models with a throughgoing vertical symmetry plane (i.e., if the dip plane of the reector coincides with a symmetry plane of the overburden), the semi-axes of the nmo ellipse are found by the more conventional rms averaging of the interval nmo velocities in the dip and strike directions. modeling of normal moveout in the most general heterogeneous anisotropic media requires dy- namic ray tracing of only one ray. remarkably, the expressions for geometrical spread- ing along the zero-oset ray contain all the components necessary to build the nmo ellipse. this method is orders of magnitude faster than multi-azimuth, multi-oset ray tracing and, therefore, can be eciently used in traveltime inversion and in devising fast dip-moveout processing algorithms for anisotropic media. this algorithm becomes especially ecient if the model consists of homogeneous layers or blocks separated by smooth interfaces. the high accuracy of our nmo expressions is illustrated by comparison with ray-traced reection traveltimes in piecewise-homogeneous, azimuthally anisotropic models. we also apply the general- ized dix equation to eld data collected over a fractured reservoir and show that p-wave moveout can be used to nd the depth-dependent fracture orientation and evaluate the magnitude of azimuthal anisotropy. pacs numbers: .xj .-f","The text presents a formalism for exact solutions of normal-moveout velocity in anisotropic media, developed by Grechka and Tsvankin.

The method of dynamic ray tracing of one ray is highlighted as an efficient approach for modeling normal moveout in heterogeneous anisotropic media. The accuracy of the normal-moveout expressions is demonstrated through comparison with ray-traced reflection traveltimes, and the application to field data collected over a fractured reservoir is discussed."
"reection moveout in inhomogeneous anisotropic media is usually calculated by multi-oset and multi-azimuth ray tracing while the existing anisotropic ray-tracing codes are suciently fast for forward modeling, their application in moveout inversion requires repeated generation of azimuthally-dependent traveltimes around many common-midpoint locations, which makes the inversion procedure extremely time-consuming. moveout modeling, however, can be simplied by taking advantage of the limited range of osets in conventional acquisition design. for common spreadlength-to-depth ratios close to unity, cmp traveltimes in media with moderate structural complexity are well described by the normal-moveout velocity dened in the zero-spread limit, even if the data exhibit nonhyperbolic moveout, nmo velocity is still responsible for the most stable, small-oset portion of the moveout curve. existing methods for computing normal-moveout velocity in inhomogeneous media are designed for isotropic models, angular velocity variations make both analytic and computational aspects of nmo-velocity modeling much more complicated. here, we present a treatment of nmo velocity in inhomogeneous anisotropic media that provides an analytic basis for moveout inversion, leads to a dramatic increase in the eciency of traveltime modeling methods, and helps to develop insight into the inuence of the anisotropic parameters on reection traveltimes. explicit expressions for normal-moveout velocity are well known for the relatively simple transversely isotropic model with a vertical symmetry axis . recently, tsvankin presented an exact nmo equation for dipping reectors valid in vertical symmetry planes of any homogeneous anisotropic medium. alkhalifah and tsvankin extended this result by developing a dix-type equation for vertically inhomogeneous anisotropic media above a dipping reector. they also showed that the nmo-velocity function in vti media depends on just two parameters the zero- dip nmo velocity vnmo and the anellipticity coecient . still, their formalism is limited to -d wave propagation in the dip plane of the reector, which should also coincide with a symmetry plane of the overburden. this work is based on a general -d treatment of normal moveout developed by grechka and tsvankin, who proved that the azimuthal dependence of nmo velocity for pure modes has an elliptical shape in the horizontal plane, even if the medium is arbitrary anisotropic and inhomogeneous. this conclusion breaks down only for subsurface models in which common-midpoint reection traveltime cannot be described by a series expansion or does not increase with oset. the orientation of the nmo ellipse and the values of its semi-axes can be expressed through the spatial derivatives of the slowness vector, which are determined by both the direction of the reector normal and the medium properties above the reector. grechka and tsvankin also presented explicit representations of the nmo velocity for a horizontal orthorhombic layer and dipping reectors beneath vti media. a detailed analysis of the nmo ellipse for transversely isotropic media with a horizontal symmetry axis is given in tsvankin, who also discusses the inversion of conventional- spread reection moveout for the parameters of hti media. sayers obtained the elliptical dependence of nmo velocity for the model of a homogeneous anisotropic layer with a horizontal symmetry plane using an approximation for long-spread moveout based on group-velocity expansion in spherical harmonics. here, we apply the formalism of grechka and tsvankin to more complicated anisotropic models. we start by deriving an explicit expression for azimuthally-dependent nmo velocity from a dipping reector overlaid by a ho- mogeneous layer of arbitrary symmetry. then we obtain a generalized dix equation for nmo velocity in a model composed of a stack of horizontal homogeneous, arbitrary-anisotropic layers above a dipping reector. while this equation has a form similar to the conventional dix formula, it is based on the averaging of the matrices that dene interval nmo ellipses. for the most general inhomogeneous media, we develop an ecient methodology to compute the normal-moveout velocity using the dynamic ray-tracing of only one ray. we show that the derivatives needed to nd the geometrical spreading, provide sucient information to build the nmo ellipse and, therefore, model reection moveout without tracing a large family of rays. finally, we compare the hyperbolic moveout equation parameterized by the exact nmo velocity with ray-traced reection traveltimes and present a eld-data application of the generalized dix dierentiation.","Reflection moveout in inhomogeneous anisotropic media is usually computed through multi-offset and multi-azimuth ray tracing, which can be time-consuming for moveout inversion due to the need for repeated generation of azimuthally-dependent traveltimes at various common-midpoint locations. Normal-moveout (NMO) velocity plays a crucial role in simplifying moveout modeling, particularly in media with moderate structural complexity. This text presents a treatment of NMO velocity in inhomogeneous anisotropic media to enhance efficiency in traveltime modeling methods and gain insights into the impact of anisotropic parameters on reflection traveltimes. Various methods and equations for NMO velocity in different types of media, such as transversely isotropic and vertically inhomogeneous anisotropic, are discussed. The text introduces a methodology to compute NMO velocity through dynamic ray tracing of a single ray, allowing for efficient modeling of reflection moveout without the need to trace multiple rays. Finally, a comparison is made between the hyperbolic moveout equation parameterized by exact NMO velocity and ray-traced reflection traveltimes, along with a field-data application of the generalized Dix differentiation method."
"suppose the traveltimes of a certain reected wave have been recorded on a number of common- midpoint gathers with dierent azimuthal orientation but the same midpoint location . if the medium is anisotropic and inhomogeneous, the dependence of large-oset reection traveltimes on the azimuth of the cmp line may become rather complicated. for conventional spreadlengths close to the distance between the cmp and the reector, however, moveout in cmp geometry is usually well-approximated by a hyperbolic equation, t t + x v nmo . here t is the zero-oset reection time, x is the source-receiver oset, and vnmo is the normal-moveout velocity dened as v nmo = lim x d d . the analysis below is based on the general result of grechka and tsvankin, who showed that nmo velocity is described by the following simple quadratic form: v nmo = w cos + w sin cos + w sin , where w is a symmetric matrix dened as wij = xixj xcmp = pi xj xcmp , . here, is the one-way traveltime from the zero-oset reection point to the location x {x, x} at the surface, is the one-way zero-oset traveltime, pi are the components of the slowness vector corresponding to the ray emerging . . . . x x r ray zero-offset t t cmp line cmp fig. : normal-moveout velocity is calculated on cmp lines with dierent azimuths and a xed midpoint location. it is not necessary to account for reection-point dispersal in the derivation of nmo velocity. at the point x, and xcmp corresponds to the cmp location; the origin of the coordinate system in the derivations below coincides with the zero-oset reection point. the one-way traveltimes appear in equation because reection-point dispersal has no inuence on the nmo velocity of pure modes, and (for the small source-receiver osets appropriate for estimation of vnmo) rays can be assumed to propagate through the reection point of the zero-oset ray, it is convenient to use the eigenvectors of the matrix w as auxiliary horizontal axes and rotate the nmo equation by the angle , = tan "" w w + p + w w # . this rotation transforms equation into v nmo = cos + sin , where , are the eigenvalues of the matrix w. grechka and tsvankin conclude that for positive and the nmo velocity represents an ellipse in the horizontal plane. a negative eigenvalue implies a negative v nmo in certain azimuthal directions and, consequently, a decrease in the cmp traveltime with oset. although such reverse moveout can exist in some cases , typically both and are positive, and the azimuthal dependence of nmo velocity is indeed elliptical. note that this conclusion is valid for arbitrary inhomogeneous anisotropic media provided the traveltime eld is suciently smooth to be adequately approximated by a taylor series expansion.","Traveltime analysis of reflected waves on common-midpoint gathers in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media involves determining the normal-moveout (NMO) velocity. The NMO velocity can be approximated by a hyperbolic equation in conventional spread lengths, with a quadratic form described by a symmetric matrix. The NMO velocity can be represented as an ellipse in the horizontal plane, where positive eigenvalues correspond to an elliptical azimuthal dependence. The azimuthal dependence of NMO velocity is elliptical in most cases, indicating a smooth traveltime field suitable for a Taylor series expansion."
"a. general case to obtain normal-moveout velocity for any given model from equations and , we need to evaluate the spatial derivatives of the slowness vector at the cmp location. as demonstrated in appendix b, for the model of a single homogeneous layer this can be done by representing the horizontal ray displacement through group velocity and using the relation between the group-velocity and slowness vectors. as a result, we nd the following explicit expressions for the matrix w and azimuthally-dependent nmo velocity : w = pq, + pq, q q,q, q ,  q, q, q, q,  , v nmo v nmo = pq, + pq, q q,q, q ,  q, cos q, sin cos + q, sin  , where q q p denotes the vertical slowness component, q,i q/pi, and q,ij q/pipj; the horizontal components of the slowness vector and the derivatives in equation are evaluated for the zero-oset ray. equation is valid for pure modes reected from horizontal or dipping interfaces in media with arbitrary symmetry and any strength of the anisotropy. the normal-moveout velocity is fully determined by the azimuth of the cmp line and the slowness vector of the zero-oset ray. the slowness components p, p and q can be found by solving the christoel equation for the slowness direction normal to the reector. (the slowness vector of the zero-oset ray is normal to the reecting interface at the reection point.) since this equation is cubic with respect to the squared phase velocity, it yields an explicit expression for the slowness vector. the derivatives of the vertical slowness q can be found directly from the christoel equation as well. as discussed in more detail below in the section on ray tracing, the slowness components satisfy the equation f = , where f is a sixth-order polynomial with respect to q. for common anisotropic models with a horizontal symmetry plane , f becomes a cubic polynomial with respect to q hence, the derivatives q,i and q,ij can be obtained as q,i = fpi fq and q,ij = fpipj + fpiqq,j + fpjqq,i + fqqq,iq,j fq , where fpi f/pi, fq f/q, fpipj f/pipj, fpiq f/piq, and fqq f/q therefore, all terms in equation can be obtained explicitly from the christoel equation. equation can also be used to develop weak-anisotropy approximations for nmo velocity by linearizing q and its derivatives in dimensionless anisotropic parameters or in perturbations in the stiness coecients. these analytic approximations provide valuable insight into the inuence of the anisotropic parameters on normal moveout, there is hardly any need, however, to substitute weak-anisotropy approximations for the exact equations in numerical modeling. thus, equation gives a simple and numerically ecient recipe to obtain azimuthally-dependent reection moveout in an arbitrary anisotropic layer. the example in figure , generated for an orthorhombic layer above a dipping reec- tor, illustrates the high accuracy of the hyperbolic moveout equation parameterized by the analytic nmo velocity in describing conventional-spread reection traveltimes. despite the presence of anisotropy-induced nonhyperbolic moveout, the p-wave nmo velocity is close to the moveout velocity calculated from the exact traveltimes on six cmp lines with dierent orientation. the maximum dierence between vnmo and the nite-spread moveout velocity is just %, which is even less than the corresponding value for the same model, but with a horizontal reector therefore, the magnitude of nonhyperbolic moveout for this model decreases with reector dip; the same observation was made by tsvankin for vertical transverse isotropy. note that although the azimuth of the dip plane of the reector is equal to , the largest axis of the vnmo ellipse has an azimuth of due to the inuence of the azimuthal anisotropy above the reector. fig. : comparison of the p-wave nmo velocity from equation and the moveout velocity obtained by least-squares tting of a hyperbola to the exact traveltimes computed for spreadlength equal to the distance between the cmp and the reector. the model contains a homogeneous orthorhombic layer (with the vertical symmetry planes at azimuths and ) above a plane dipping reector; the dip and azimuth of the reector are equal to (azimuthal angles are shown along the perimeter of the plot). the relevant medium parameters are vp = km/s, = , = , = , = , = the vertical symmetry plane at zero azimuth has the properties of the vti model of dog creek shale, while the second vertical symmetry plane is equivalent to taylor sandstone; both models are described in thomsen","In the section on Homogeneous arbitrary anisotropic layers, the text discusses obtaining the normal-moveout velocity for any model by evaluating spatial derivatives of the slowness vector at the common mid-point (cmp) location.

The text details equations and methods for calculating these values, considering anisotropy in media with arbitrary symmetry.

"model with a vertical symmetry plane next, let us consider a special case a model in which the dip plane of the reector coincides with a vertical symmetry plane of the layer. the medium can be, for instance, transversely isotropic with the symmetry axis conned to the dip plane or orthorhombic. the mirror symmetry with respect to the dip plane implies that one of the axes of the nmo ellipse points in the dip direction. below, we provide a formal proof of this fact, as well as concise expressions for the azimuthally dependent nmo velocity in this model. it is convenient to align the x-axis with the azimuth of the dip plane, while the x-axis will point in the strike direction. evidently, the zero-oset ray should lie in the vertical symmetry plane x = , and its slowness component p goes to zero. as another consequence of the mirror symmetry with respect to the dip plane, p/x = (i.e, rays corresponding to x = stay in the dip plane and cannot have a non-zero p), so the cross-term q, in equation vanishes, and the nmo velocity simplies to v nmo = pq, q q,q,  q, cos + q, sin  . equation describes an ellipse with the semi-axes in the dip and strike directions: v nmo = q, pq, q , v nmo( = , p) = q, pq, q . the dip-line nmo velocity was originally obtained via the in-plane phase velocity v by tsvankin: vnmo = v cos s + v dv d = tan v dv d = , where is the phase angle with vertical in the dip plane, and is the reector dip. in the form v nmo was rst given by cohen equation provides a similar representation for the nmo velocity in the strike direction. equations and are always valid for transversely isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis because of the mirror symmetry with respect to any vertical plane in this model. the vertical slowness in vti media can be represented as q q  p p + p  and, for p = , q, = q,/p then equation for the strike-line nmo velocity reduces to the expression obtained previously, v nmo( = , p) = q, p . grechka and tsvankin also gave an equivalent form of equation in terms of the phase-velocity function and the weak-anisotropy approximation for v nmo( = , p). due to the axial symmetry of the vti model, both the dip-line and strike-line nmo velocities depend on the derivatives of q with respect to the single horizontal slowness component . the cubic equation for q in vti media is particularly easy to solve because it splits into a quadratic equation for p sv waves and a linear equation for the sh-wave. finally, in isotropic media the vertical slowness can be directly expressed through the reector dip : q = q v p = cos v , and equations and yield the well-known relationships presented by levin: vnmo = v cos , vnmo( = ) = v . horizontal reector for a horizontal reector , equation reduces to v nmo = q q,q, q ,  q, cos q, sin cos + q, sin  , where q and q,ij should be evaluated at the vertical slowness direction. further simplication can be achieved for a medium with a vertical symmetry plane. aligning the x-axis with the symmetry-plane direction and substituting p = into equation yields v nmo = q q,q,  q, cos + q, sin  . as shown by grechka and tsvankin, for an orthorhombic layer p-wave nmo velocity from equation becomes a simple function of the vertical p-wave velocity vp and the anisotropic coecients and dened by tsvankin: v nmo = v p ) ) + sin + cos . note that the linearized coecients introduced by mensch and rasolofosaon and gajewski and p sen c k within the framework of the weak-anisotropy approximation are not appropriate for the exact equation . normal- moveout velocities for vertical and horizontal transverse isotropy can be easily found as special cases of equation equation can also be used to derive similar expressions for the split shear waves in orthorhombic media. x x . layer layer . . . . . . l l . . . zero-offset reflection point zero-offset ray layer cmp lines . . . . . . fig. : a dipping reector beneath a horizontally layered overburden. normal-moveout velocity in this model can be obtained from the generalized dix equation derived here.","The section discusses special cases where the dip plane of a reflector aligns with a vertical symmetry plane in the layer.

"a. generalized dix equation here, we show that the nmo ellipse for vertically inhomogeneous arbitrary anisotropic media above a dipping reector can be obtained by dix-type averaging of the matrices w responsible for the interval nmo ellipses. in our derivation we essentially follow the approach employed by alkhalifah and tsvankin to obtain a -d dix-type nmo equation for rays conned to the incidence plane that contains the cmp line. their equation is valid only in the dip plane of the reector, which should also coincide with a symmetry plane of the medium. in contrast, we make no assumptions about the mutual orientation of the cmp line and reector strike, and take full account of the out-of-plane phenomena associated with both model geometry and depth-varying anisotropy. to construct the eective nmo ellipse, we need to obtain the matrix w dened in equation : wij = pi xj , , where is the total zero-oset traveltime and xi is the horizontal ray displacement between the zero-oset reection point located at the l-th interface and the surface . due to the continuity of the ray, both and xi are equal to the sum of the respective interval values: = l x = , xi = l x = xi,, . (note that here and below in the section on layered media, the comma in the subscripts separates the layer index and does not denote dierentiation.) it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary matrix yij xi pj , with derivatives evaluated for the ray parameters p and p of the zero-oset ray. then w w = y . in a model composed of horizontally homogeneous layers above the reector, the horizontal components p and p of the slowness vector remain constant along any given ray between the reection point and the surface. therefore, substituting equation into equation , we nd yij xi pj = l x = xi, pj l x = yij,. equation explains the reason for introducing the eective matrix y: unlike the matrix w, it can be decom- posed into the sum of the matrices yfor the individual layers. since all intermediate boundaries are horizontal, the ray displacements xi,in any layer coincide with the values that should be used in computing the matrix w and the interval nmo velocity for this particular layer. hence, we can apply equation to layer : w= y and, therefore, y= w . substituting equations and into equation leads to the nal result: w = l x = w . interval matrices win terms of the components of the slowness vector are given by equation , while the traveltimes should be obtained from the kinematic ray tracing of the zero-oset ray. note that, since the eigenvalues of the matrices wand w usually are positive (under the assumptions discussed in grechka and tsvankin), these matrices are nonsingular and, therefore, can be inverted. equation performs dix-type averaging of the interval matrices wto obtain the eective matrix w and the eective normal-moveout velocity vnmo. it should be emphasized that the interval nmo velocities vnmo, (or the interval matrices w) in equation are computed for the horizontal components of the slowness vector of the zero-oset ray. (as follows from snells law, the slowness vector of the zero-oset ray is normal to the reector at the reection point.) this means that the interval matrices win equation correspond to the generally non-existent reectors that are orthogonal to the slowness vector of the zero-oset ray in each layer. rewriting equation in the dix dierentiation form gives w = w w . equations and generalize the dix formula for horizontally-layered arbitrary anisotropic media above a dipping reector. formally, this extension looks relatively straightforward: the squared nmo velocities in the dix formula are simply replaced by the inverse matrices w also, the generalized dix dierentiation is subject to the same limitation as its conventional counterpart: the thickness of the layer of interest should not be too much smaller than the layers depth. in contrast to the conventional dix equation, however, the eective matrix w in equation cannot be obtained from seismic data directly since the corresponding reector usually does not exist in the subsurface. therefore, layer-stripping by means of equation involves recalculating each interval matrix wfrom one value of the slowness vector to another that of the zero-oset ray. this procedure was discussed for the -d case by alkhalifah and tsvankin and further developed for p-waves in vti media by alkhalifah; the latter paper also contains a successful application of this algorithm to eld data. only in the simplest special case of a horizontal reector, does the slowness vector of the zero-oset ray not change its direction all the way to the surface, and the interval matrices wcorrespond to the nmo velocities from horizontal interfaces that can be measured from reection data. note that although such a model is horizontally- homogeneous, the zero-oset ray is not necessarily vertical , and the zero-oset reection point may be shifted in the horizontal direction from the cmp location.","The text discusses the application of the Dix equation in vertically inhomogeneous anisotropic media above a dipping reflector. By averaging matrices responsible for interval NMO ellipses, an effective NMO ellipse can be obtained. The approach accounts for out-of-plane phenomena and depth-varying anisotropy. The text introduces an auxiliary matrix to simplify calculations for horizontally homogeneous layers. The final result is a generalized Dix formula for horizontally-layered anisotropic media. This method involves recalculating interval matrices to determine effective NMO velocities, as the corresponding reflector usually does not exist in the subsurface. Special cases where the zero-offset ray remains unchanged can allow for direct measurement of NMO velocities from horizontal interfaces."
"next, we consider the same special case as for the single-layer model a medium in which all layers have a common vertical symmetry plane that coincides with the dip plane of the reector . for such a model the matrices win the individual layers are diagonal , and w,= . consequently, the o-diagonal elements of the matrix w vanish as well: w = . if the matrix w is diagonal, its two components directly determine the semi-axes of the nmo ellipse [see equation and appendix a]: wkk,= [v nmo,] and wkk = [v nmo] , , where [v nmo vnmo] and [v nmo vnmo] are the nmo velocities measured in the dip and strike directions, respectively. substitution of equations into equations and yields more conventional dix-type averaging and dierentiation formulas for the dip- and strike-components of the normal-moveout velocity: [v nmo] = l x = [v nmo,] and [v nmo,] = [v nmo] [v nmo] , . equations and for the dip component of the nmo velocity were derived by alkhalifah and tsvankin who considered -d wave propagation in the dip plane of the reector. our derivation shows that the same dix-type equations can be applied to the strike-component of the nmo velocity, which determines the second semi-axis of the nmo ellipse. despite the close resemblance of expressions and to the conventional dix equation, the interval nmo velocities in equations and , as in the more general dix equation discussed above, correspond to the non-existent reectors normal to the slowness vector of the zero-oset ray in each layer.","In the B model with a vertical symmetry plane, all layers share this symmetry plane aligned with the dip plane of the reflector. The matrices representing the individual layers become diagonal, leading to vanishing off-diagonal elements. The diagonal elements directly determine the semi-axes of the normal-moveout (NMO) ellipse, which corresponds to the NMO velocities measured in the dip and strike directions. Equations derived from this model provide conventional Dix-type averaging and differentiation formulas for the NMO velocity components. These equations apply to both dip and strike components, determining the semi-axes of the NMO ellipse. Despite similarities to conventional Dix equations, the interval NMO velocities correspond to non-existent reflectors normal to the slowness vector of the zero-offset ray in each layer."
"although the generalized dix equation operates with the matrices w , we proved that dix-type averaging can be applied to the dip- and strike-components of the normal-moveout velocity in a model that has a common vertical symmetry plane aligned with the dip plane of the reector. it is also clear from the results of the previous section that the rms averaging of the interval nmo velocities is valid in any azimuthal direction, if all interval nmo ellipses degenerate into circles. hence, the error of this more conventional averaging procedure depends on the elongation of the interval ellipses, a quantity controlled by both azimuthal anisotropy and reector dip. in appendix c we show that this error increases rather slowly as the interval ellipses pull away from a circle because the rms averaging of the interval velocities provides a linear approximation vnmo to the exact nmo velocity, if both are expanded in the elongation coecient. to quantify this conclusion, we consider two numerical examples. figure shows the azimuthally-dependent p-wave nmo velocity in an orthorhombic medium consisting of three horizontal layers with strong azimuthal anisotropy. while the exact nmo ellipse happens to be close to a circle, the approximate, rms-averaged normal- moveout velocity has an oval noncircular shape because the interval nmo ellipses are far dierent from circles. the maximum error of the rms averaging is about %, which will lead to much higher errors in the interval fig. : comparison of the exact p-wave nmo ellipse and an approximate nmo velocity obtained by the dix-type averaging . the model contains three horizontal orthorhombic layers with a horizontal symmetry plane. the azimuth of the symmetry plane in the rst layer is = , in the second layer = , and in the third layer = the vertical p-wave velocities are vp , = km/s, vp , = km/s, and vp , = km/s; the interval zero-oset traveltimes are equal to each other . the relevant anisotropic parameters are (subscripts denote the layer number): layer = , = , layer = , = , layer = , and = . velocities after application of the dix dierentiation . evidently, for this model it is necessary to use the exact nmo equation, which properly accounts for the inuence of azimuthal anisotropy on normal moveout. for models with moderate azimuthal anisotropy and a horizontal reector (i.e., with the interval nmo-velocity variation limited by -%), the accuracy of the rms averaging of nmo velocities is much higher. this implies that for such media it is possible to obtain the interval nmo velocity by the conventional dix dierentiation at a given azimuth. in the special case of horizontally layered hti media (transverse isotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry), the same conclusion was made by al-dajani and tsvankin it should be emphasized, however, that for dipping reectors the dix dierentiation cannot be applied in the standard fashion because the interval nmo velocities are still calculated for non-existent reectors and cannot be found directly from the data. in the presence of anisotropy, interval parameter estimation using dipping events is impossible without a layer-stripping procedure that requires reconstruction of the nmo ellipses in the overburden and, therefore, cannot be carried out for a single azimuth. on the whole, we would recommend to use the generalized dix equation for any azimuthally anisotropic model, provided the azimuthal coverage of the data is sucient to reconstruct the dependence vnmo. since our algorithm operates with the nmo ellipses rather than individual azimuthal moveout measurements, it has the additional ad- vantage of smoothing the azimuthal variation of nmo velocity, which helps to eliminate outliers and stabilize the interval parameter estimation. a eld-data application of the generalized dix equation is discussed below. another example, in which the interval nmo ellipses dier from circles due to the inuence of reector dip in a purely isotropic layered model, is shown in figure obviously, in this model the dip plane of the reector always represents a symmetry plane, and one of the axes of all interval nmo ellipses is parallel to the dip direction. as shown in the previous section, in this case the rms averaging of the interval nmo velocities becomes exact for the dip and strike cmp lines , where the interval nmo values are well known figure corroborates this conclusion: for azimuths = and = the rms-averaged nmo velocity vnmo is equal to the exact value vnmo. in all other azimuths, equation gives only an approximation to the exact nmo velocity. however, figure indicates that this approximation is quite accurate for small and moderate reector dips. the maximum error of equation , for example, is only % for reector dip = and % for dip azimuth vnmo/vnmo ~ fig. : the rms-averaged nmo velocity vnmo normalized by the exact value in isotropic media; the azimuth is measured with respect to the dip plane of the reector. the model contains three layers above the reector with the interval velocities v = km/s, v = km/s, and v = km/s and the interval zero-oset traveltimes = = = s. the reector dips are = , = , = , and = = clearly, the error increases with dip because the interval nmo ellipses become more elongated and diverge more from a circle. again, since the reector is dipping, the interval nmo velocities in figure are calculated for the nonzero horizontal components of the slowness vector determined by the reector dip. these interval velocities correspond to non- existent reectors and need to be recalculated from the nmo velocities of the horizontal events (which is, however, straightforward for isotropic media).","The text discusses the accuracy of the root mean square (rms) averaging of normal-moveout (NMO) velocities in seismic data processing. It highlights that for models with common vertical symmetry planes and when interval NMO ellipses degenerate into circles, the rms averaging is valid in any azimuthal direction. The error of this conventional averaging method depends on the elongation of interval ellipses, controlled by azimuthal anisotropy and reector dip. The text emphasizes the importance of using the generalized Dix equation for azimuthally anisotropic models and the need for precise calculations in the presence of dipping reflectors. It suggests utilizing the generalized Dix equation for anisotropic models with sufficient azimuthal data coverage. The approach aims to smooth azimuthal variations in NMO velocities, enhance stability in parameter estimation, and eliminate outliers. The accuracy of the rms averaging of NMO velocities is influenced by dip and azimuth angles, with the error increasing for more elongated ellipses. Overall, the text recommends considering the specific geological setting and model characteristics when applying seismic processing techniques for accurate velocity estimations."
"a. summary of ray tracing here, we give a brief overview of ray-theory equations for anisotropic media,,, which we use below to obtain normal-moveout velocity in the presence of both anisotropy and inhomogeneity. the wave equation can be written in the frequency domain as ui + xj  cijkl ul xk  = , where is the angular frequency, is the density, cijkl cijkl = aijkl is the elasticity tensor in the cartesian coordinates x, and u u is the displacement vector. the indexes i, j, k, l take on values from to ; summation over repeated indexes is implied. within the framework of ray theory, the displacement eld is sought in the form of a series expansion, u = x n= u n expi . substituting this trial solution into equation and retaining only the leading term of the series yields al = , where a u, pj pj = /xj is the slowness vector, il is the symbolic kronecker delta, and a is the polarization vector. note that the slowness vector p is normal to the wavefront = constant. from equation it is clear that a non-trivial solution for the vector a exists only if the following equation is satised: f det = . for real quantities pj corresponding to homogeneous waves, solutions a of equation are real and orthogonal to each other. therefore, they can be used to form an orthonormal basis: a a = rs . since pj = /xj depends on x in heterogeneous media, equation can be regarded as a non-linear partial dierential equation for the function . the hamilton-jacobi theory or method of characteristics (courant and hilbert ) can be used to rewrite this equation in the form of the ordinary dierential equations (the so-called ray equations): dxm d = h pm = aimklaipkal , dpm d = h xm = aijkl xm aipjpkal , . the hamiltonian h, obtained from equation , is given by h h = aijklaipjpkal = . note that the rst of equations denes the group velocity, g dx d . substituting the rst equation and equation into , we obtain an important relation between the slowness and the group velocity vectors p g = . since p = n/v , where n is the unit vector in the phase direction, and v is the phase velocity, equation can be further rewritten as a relation between phase and group velocities, n g = v . for rays emanating from a point source located at the origin of the coordinate system, the ray-tracing equations should be supplemented by the following initial conditions: x = , p = n v . the ray-tracing system combined with the initial conditions can be solved by numerical integration using, for instance, the runge-kutta method.","The text discusses ray tracing in inhomogeneous anisotropic media, presenting the wave equation in the frequency domain and the use of ray theory for displacement field solutions. The text also covers the slowness vector, polarization vector, and orthonormal basis formation for homogeneous waves. Furthermore, it introduces non-linear partial differential equations and the Hamilton-Jacobi theory for rewriting equations into ordinary differential equations (ray equations). The text emphasizes the importance of group velocity, phase velocity, and initial conditions for solving the ray-tracing system in inhomogeneous media through numerical integration methods such as the Runge-Kutta method."
"the results of grechka and tsvankin, briey reviewed above, show that there is no need to perform a full-scale multi-azimuth ray tracing to compute reection traveltimes on conventional cmp spreads. it is clear from equation that the nmo ellipse and conventional-spread moveout as a whole are fully dened by only three quantities w, w, and w thus, three well-separated azimuthal measurements of vnmo [which usually can be obtained using hyperbolic semblance analysis based on equation ] are sucient to reconstruct the nmo ellipse and nd the nmo velocity for any azimuth . in practice, the values of vnmo determined on nite cmp spreads may be distorted by the inuence of nonhyperbolic moveout. however, reection moveout for spreadlengths close to the distance of the cmp from the reector is typically close to hyperbolic; this has been shown in a number of publications,, and is further illustrated by numerical examples in this work. although calculation of wij from vnmo obtained in three azimuths is much more ecient than multi-azimuth ray tracing, it still requires a considerable amount of computation and does not take advantage of the explicit expressions for the parameters of the nmo-velocity ellipse discussed above. it is much more attractive to build the nmo ellipse directly from equations and , which requires obtaining the spatial derivatives of the ray parameter pi/xj at the cmp location . here, we outline an ecient method of calculating these derivatives based on the dynamic ray-tracing equations for the zero-oset ray. let us consider the zero-oset ray in the ray coordinates . the parameter has the meaning of the traveltime along the ray, while and are supposed to uniquely determine the ray path and can be chosen, for instance, as the horizontal components of the slowness vector . here, we use another option suggested by kashtan and kendall and thomson, and dene and as the polar and azimuthal angles of the slowness vector : n = . the derivatives pi/xj, needed to calculate vnmo, can be formally written as pi xj = pi xj + pi xj + pi xj . using the matrix notation p =  p , p , p  , x =  x , x , x  and the fact that the inverse matrix x contains the rows x = /x /x /x , we represent equation in the form pi xj = p x . hence, if the matrices have been calculated for the zero-oset ray at the cmp location, the derivatives pi/xj, can be determined as the upper-left submatrix of the matrix . after computing the zero-oset traveltime using kinematic ray tracing, we can nd the nmo velocity from equations and . note that the values of pi/xj used in the nmo-velocity calculation correspond to one-way propagation from the zero-oset reection point to the surface in other words, both p and x should be computed for rays emanating from an imaginary source located at the reection point of the zero-oset ray. the third column of the matrices p and x can be obtained using the kinematic ray-tracing equations . to nd the rst and second columns [i.e., the derivatives p/n and x/n, ], let us consider the so-called dynamic ray-tracing equations responsible for the geometrical spreading along the ray, these equations are obtained by dierentiating the kinematic ray-tracing system with respect to and : d d xm n  = n , d d pm n  = n aijkl xm aipjpkal  , . the initial conditions for these equations are, in turn, derived by dierentiating the corresponding initial condi- tions for the kinematic ray-tracing equations . taking into account equation , we nd x n = , p n = v n n n v  g n n  , , where v , n, and g are the phase velocity, the unit vector in the wave-normal direction and the group- velocity vector at the source location. in our case, the velocities v and g should be evaluated immediately above the reector at the zero-oset reection point . the derivatives of the wave-normal vector n/n can be computed in a straightforward way from equation . thus, the derivatives needed to obtain the normal-moveout velocity are exactly the same as those required to compute the geometrical spreading along the zero-oset ray. this result is not entirely surprising because nmo velocity is related to the wavefront curvature, which, in turn, determines geometrical spreading. therefore, the azimuthally-dependent nmo velocity in inhomogeneous arbitrary anisotropic media can be computed by integrating the dynamic ray-tracing equations for the one-way zero-oset ray and substituting the results into equations , and . since this approach requires tracing of only one zero-oset ray together with the derivatives , it is orders of magnitude less time consuming than is the tracing of hundreds of reected rays for dierent azimuths and source-receiver osets as would otherwise be required. moreover, as shown in the next section, our algorithm becomes signicantly simpler, both analytically and computationally, if the model consists of homogeneous layers or blocks.","The section discusses a method for efficiently computing the normal-moveout (NMO) velocity in seismic data processing. By utilizing three well-separated azimuthal measurements of the NMO velocity, the NMO ellipse can be reconstructed and the NMO velocity determined for any azimuth. The approach involves calculating derivatives of the ray parameter at the common midpoint (CMP) location and using dynamic ray-tracing equations for the zero-offset ray. By integrating these equations and substituting the results, the azimuthally-dependent NMO velocity in inhomogeneous, arbitrary anisotropic media can be effectively computed. This method significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional multi-azimuth ray tracing and is particularly advantageous for homogeneous layer or block models."
"let us consider a medium composed of arbitrary anisotropic homogeneous layers separated by smooth in- terfaces. in this case, the ray trajectory is piecewise linear, and integration of the kinematic ray-tracing equations reduces to summation along straight ray segments: x = x + g , p = const , where x denotes the ray coordinate at the interface between the -th and -th layer, is the traveltime inside the -th layer, and g is the group velocity in this layer. dierentiation of equations yields two derivatives required in the computation of the nmo ellipse: x/ = g , p/ = , with the group-velocity vector g evaluated for the zero-oset ray at the cmp location. to fully describe the ray path , equations must be supplemented by the boundary conditions at model interfaces for x and p. the boundary conditions will also be used in the equations for dynamic ray tracing discussed below. since the ray has to be continuous, x = x . the ray parameter p satises snells law, p b = p b , where denotes the cross product and b is the unit vector normal to the -th interface at x. integration of the dynamic ray-tracing equations in the case of homogeneous layers is relatively straightforward as well. continuation of the derivatives x/n and p/n across the -th layer is expressed by x n = x n + g n and p n = p n , . the derivative of the group velocity needed in equation is obtained in appendix d from equations and . to propagate the derivatives x/n and p/n across the -th interface, kashtan suggested dier- entiating equations and snells law with respect to n. his results become especially simple for a plane interface with the normal b: x n = x n + g g g b  b x n  and p n = p n b b g  g p n  , . equations allow us to continue the initial values of the derivatives x/n and p/n from the zero-oset reection point through our layered model to the surface. since the quantities needed to obtain these derivatives have to be found for the kinematic ray-tracing anyway, the additional computational cost of this operation is minimal. finally, we calculate the derivatives pi/xj from equation and construct the vnmo ellipse dened by equations and .","The text discusses the behavior of ray trajectories in piecewise homogeneous media, composed of anisotropic homogeneous layers with smooth interfaces. Ray paths are piecewise linear, and kinematic ray-tracing equations can be integrated by summation along straight ray segments. Boundary conditions at model interfaces are crucial for describing ray paths, with continuity and Snell's law playing key roles. Dynamic ray tracing in homogeneous layers involves straightforward integration of equations. Derivatives of group velocity are important for propagation across interfaces. The process of propagating derivatives through the layered model incurs minimal computational cost. The derivatives are used to construct the VNMO ellipse."
"the accuracy of our single-layer nmo equation has been discussed above . here, we carry out synthetic tests to compare the hyperbolic moveout equation parameterized by the exact nmo velocity with ray- traced traveltimes for inhomogeneous anisotropic models. figure illustrates the performance of the dix equation for a model that includes three anisotropic layers with dierent symmetry above a dipping reector . we used ray tracing to calculate p-wave reection traveltimes along six azimuths with increment and obtained moveout velocities by tting a hyperbola to the exact moveout. despite the complexity of the model, the best-t ellipse found from the nite-spread moveout velocities are suciently close to the theoretical nmo ellipse computed from equations and . a small dierence between the ellipses is caused by nonhyperbolic moveout associated with both anisotropy and vertical inhomogeneity. it is clear from figure b that the inuence of nonhyperbolic moveout becomes substantial only at source-receiver osets that exceed the distance between the cmp and the reector. a similar example, but this time for a horizontally inhomogeneous medium above the reector is shown in figure the model contains three transversely isotropic layers with dipping lower boundaries and dierently oriented symmetry axes. the nmo ellipse provides an excellent approximation to the eective moveout velocity for all four azimuths used in the computation, with a maximum error of just about %. in addition to verifying the accuracy of our algorithm based on the evaluation of the derivatives x/n and p/n, this test demonstrates again that the analytic normal-moveout velocity typically provides a good approximation for p-wave reection traveltimes on conventional spreads.","The section presents synthetic tests comparing the accuracy of the hyperbolic moveout equation parameterized by the exact NMO velocity with ray-traced travel times for inhomogeneous anisotropic models. The tests include models with three anisotropic layers above a dipping reflector and a horizontally inhomogeneous medium.

The results show that nonhyperbolic moveout is significant only at source-receiver offsets exceeding the distance between the CMP and the reflector. The tests confirm the algorithm's accuracy and highlight that the NMO velocity provides a good approximation for p-wave reflection traveltimes."
"we applied the generalized dix equation to a -d data set acquired by arco (with funding from the gas research institute) in the powder river basin, wyoming. a detailed description of this survey and preliminary processing results can be found in corrigan et al. and withers and corrigan the main goal of the experiment was to use the azimuthal dependence of p-wave signatures in characterization of a fractured reservoir. hence, the acquisition was carefully designed to provide a good oset coverage in a wide range of source-receiver azimuths. to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, the data were collected into a number of superbins, each with an almost random distribution of azimuths and osets. below we show the results of our velocity analysis for one of the superbins located in the southwest corner of the survey area. to obtain the azimuthal dependence of nmo velocity, we divided the traces into nine azimuthal sectors and carried out conventional hyperbolic semblance analysis separately for each sector. figure shows the composite cmp gather in one of the sectors with two prominent reection events marked by arrows. according to withers and corrigan, the reection at a two-way vertical time of s corresponds to the bottom of the frontier/niobrara formations, and the event at s is the basement reection. semblance panels for two sectors apart are displayed in figure while the best-t stacking velocity for the event at s is weakly dependent on azimuth, the velocity for the basement reection is noticeably higher at azimuth ne. this observation is conrmed by the shape of the eective nmo ellipses reconstructed from the semblance panels . the stacking test of generalized dix equation vti hti orthorhombic o cmp lines fig. : the model used in figure to check the accuracy of the generalized dix equation. layer is transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis and relevant parameters vp , = km/s, = , = . layer is ti with a horizontal symmetry axis and vp , = km/s, = , = . layer is orthorhombic with vp , = km/s, = , = , = , = , = ; the azimuth of the symmetry plane = the interface depths are z = km, z = km, z = km. the reector dip is , the azimuth of the dip plane is velocity of the basement reection along the larger semi-axis of the ellipse is % higher than in the orthogonal direction; the corresponding number for the shallower reection is %. the orientation of both eective ellipses agrees with the results of withers and corrigan, who used a dierent algorithm. it should be mentioned that ignoring azimuthal velocity variations on the order of -% and mixing up all source-receiver azimuths (as is conventionally done in -d processing) would inevitably lead to poor stacking and deterioration of the nal seismic image. since the dips in the survey area are extremely small, the azimuthal dependence of stacking velocity can be attributed to the inuence of azimuthal anisotropy associated with vertical fractures. to study the interval properties for vertical times between and s, we applied the generalized dix equation to the eective nmo ellipses. note that the dierent orientation of the eective ellipses in figure , indicative of depth-varying principal directions of the azimuthal anisotropy, does not pose a problem for the generalized dix dierentiation. the pronounced azimuthal variation in the interval nmo velocity can be explained by the intense fracturing in the layer immediately above the basement. the direction of the larger semi-axis of the interval nmo ellipse is in general agreement with the predominant fracture orientation in the deeper part of the section determined from borehole data and shear-wave splitting analysis complete processing/inversion results for the survey area will be reported in forthcoming publications.","Generalized Dix equation applied to seismic data set in Powder River Basin, Wyoming for fractured reservoir characterization.

"azimuthally-dependent normal-moveout velocity around a certain cmp location is described by a simple quadratic form and usually has an elliptical shape, with the orientation and semi-axes of the ellipse determined by the properties of the medium and the direction of the reector normal at the zero-oset reection point. using this general result obtained by grechka and tsvankin, we have presented a series of solutions for the exact normal-moveout velocity of pure modes in anisotropic models of various complexity. for a homogeneous anisotropic layer above a dipping reector, nmo velocity was found explicitly as a function of the slowness vector corresponding to the zero-oset ray. this single-layer equation is valid for arbitrary anisotropic symmetry and any orientation of the cmp line with respect to the reector strike. the vertical component of the slowness vector and its derivatives with respect to the horizontal a o o b t fig. : comparison between the theoretical p-wave nmo ellipse calculated from the generalized dix equation and moveout velocities obtained from ray-traced traveltimes for spreadlength equal to the distance between the cmp and the reector . the model is shown in figure ;

It highlights the use of a generalized equation for moveout modeling and inversion in vertically inhomogeneous anisotropic models. The study emphasizes the importance of using the generalized Dix equation for accurate and stable parameter estimation. It also introduces an algorithm for computational efficiency in obtaining the normal-moveout velocity. The text concludes with the application of the formalism in fracture detection using p-wave data in a fractured reservoir, showcasing the practicality and effectiveness of the approach in characterizing fracture networks."

the nmo-velocity ellipse azimuthally dependent normal-moveout velocity is described by equation of the main text as a general second- order curve in the horizontal plane. the expression for vnmo can be simplied further by aligning the horizontal coordinate axes with the eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix w this rotation reduces equation to v nmo = cos + sin , where and are the eigenvalues of the matrix w, and is the angle between the eigenvector corresponding to and the x-axis. to verify the equivalence between equations and , we expand cos = cos cos + sin sin cos cos + sin sin and sin = cos sin sin sin cos cos + sin cos . equations and are identical if w = cos + sin , w = sin , and w = sin + cos . inverting equations for , and yields , =  w + w q + w  and tan = w w + p + w w , . equations and show that , are indeed the eigenvalues of w and tan is equal to the ratio of the components and of the eigenvector corresponding to if w = , the matrix w is diagonal, and equation reduces to equation without any rotation. as follows from equation , vnmo represents an ellipse in the horizontal plane if the eigenvalues , are positive the principal values of the azimuthally dependent nmo velocity are given by v nmo = i , . appendix b: nmo velocity in a single layer here, we obtain the exact expression for the nmo velocity from a dipping reector beneath a homogeneous arbitrary anisotropic layer. the derivation is based on the general equations and describing the nmo ellipse and follows the approach suggested for the -d case by cohen to evaluate the derivatives xi/pj, we have to relate the horizontal ray displacements between the zero- oset reection point and the surface to the horizontal components of the slowness vector . we start by introducing the group-velocity vector g, xi = gi , , where is the one-way traveltime. using the fact that the projection of the group-velocity vector on the slowness direction is equal to phase velocity , we can write p g = pg + pg + pg = . dierentiating equation with respect to pi and taking into account that the vertical slowness component p can be considered as a function of p and p yields gi = p pi g p g pi , . since the slowness vector p is normal to the group-velocity surface g, while the vectors g/pi are tangent to this surface, p g pi = hence, gi = q,ig , , where q q p denotes the vertical slowness, and q,i q/pi. substitution of equations into equa- tion gives a representation of the vertical group-velocity component that will be needed later in the derivation: g = q pq, pq, . using equations , we rewrite the horizontal ray displacements xi from equations as xi = q,ig , . note that g is the depth of the zero-oset reection point, which is independent of the slowness components . therefore, dierentiating equations yields yij xi pj = q,ijg , where q,ij q/pipj is a symmetric matrix of the second derivatives of the vertical slowness. the nmo ellipse is determined by the matrix w , w = y , where the inverse matrix y should be evaluated for the horizontal slowness components of the zero-oset ray. substituting yij from equation into equation and using expression for g, we obtain w = y = pq, + pq, q q,q, q ,  q, q, q, q,  . with the matrix w from equation , equation of the nmo ellipse in a homogeneous arbitrary anisotropic layer takes the following form: v nmo v nmo = pq, + pq, q q,q, q ,  q, cos q, sin cos + q, sin  . appendix c: relation between the exact and rms-averaged nmo velocity here, we examine the accuracy of the rms averaging of the interval nmo velocities for a model that consists of a stack of horizontal arbitrary anisotropic layers above a dipping reector. the interval nmo velocity in the -th layer is given by equation : v nmo, = w,cos + w,sin cos + w,sin . the symmetric matrix wis expressed through its eigenvalues ,and ,in equations . here, we assume that ,> ,: ,, , , where > , for all . an approximate nmo velocity is obtained by rms averaging of the interval values at the azimuth as v nmo = l x =  w,cos + w,sin cos + w,sin  in general, vnmo from equation may be thought of as an approximation of the exact normal-moveout velocity vnmo from equation , v nmo =  w cos + w sin cos + w sin  =  w w (w )   w cos w sin cos + w sin  , where w ij are the elements of the inverse matrix w given by the dix-type equation : w = l x = w . clearly, the direct rms averaging of nmo velocities in equation is dierent from the more complicated averaging of the inverse matrices w used to obtain the exact nmo velocity in equation . nevertheless, we will show that the two representations of the nmo velocity become identical in the linear approximation with respect to , i.e., vnmo = vnmo + o( ) . in the following derivation, we keep only terms independent of or linear in . combining equations and allows us to express the interval matrices wthrough the eigenvalue and , w,= , w,= sin cos , w,= , where are the rotation angles of the interval nmo ellipses introduced in appendix a. substituting equation into equation , we nd the following linearized expression for the rms- averaged nmo velocity: v nmo = l x =  cos  . next, we need to evaluate the eective nmo ellipse in the same approximation. using equation and dropping terms quadratic in , we represent the inverse matrices w as w =  cos sin cos sin cos sin  . after averaging the matrices in accordance with equation and substituting the result into equation , we obtain v nmo = l x =  cos  . since equations and are identical, the rms-averaged velocity vnmo is indeed equal to the exact nmo velocity in the linear approximation with respect to . therefore, vnmo should represent a good approximation in models with small and moderate values of , for which terms quadratic in can be ignored. appendix d: the derivatives of group velocity with respect to the ray parameters and the derivation in this appendix reproduces the result of kashtan equation contains the

"ieee transactions on circuits and systems for video technology mask-aware networks for crowd counting shengqin jiang, xiaobo lu, yinjie lei, lingqiao liu abstractcrowd counting problem aims to count the number of objects within an image or a frame in the videos and is usually solved by estimating the density map generated from the object location annotations. the values in the density map, by nature, take two possible states: zero indicating no object around, a non-zero value indicating the existence of objects and the value denoting the local object density. in contrast to traditional meth- ods which do not differentiate the density prediction of these two states, we propose to use a dedicated network branch to predict the object/non-object mask and then combine its prediction with the input image to produce the density map. our rationale is that the mask prediction could be better modeled as a binary segmentation problem and the difculty of estimating the density could be reduced if the mask is known. a key to the proposed scheme is the strategy of incorporating the mask prediction into the density map estimator. to this end, we study ve possible solutions, and via analysis and experimental validation we identify the most effective one. through extensive experiments on ve public datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over the baselines and show that our network could achieve the state-of-the-art performance. index termscrowd counting; mask-aware network; density map; regression","Mask-aware networks for crowd counting aim to improve object counting in images and videos by incorporating object/non-object mask prediction into density map estimation, where zero denotes no object and non-zero values signify object presence and density.

"c rowd counting is a signicant topic for crowd un- derstanding and analysis , which has attracted much attention in multimedia and computer vision community due to large and practical demands for better management, safety and security , . it aims to count the number of objects within an image or a frame in the videos and is a very challenging problem because the objects-of-interest, e.g., people, can occur at a variety of scales, with heavy occlusions and cluttered visual appearances. also, due to the difculty in providing highly detailed annotations such as object bounding boxes or instance-level segmentation masks, existing datasets usually adopt a weak-level annotating scheme by labeling each object with a dot inside. these challenges make the traditional detection based approach less robust and most existing methods choose to solve this problem by estimating a density map generated from the dot-level annotation. once the density map is correctly estimated, the this work is done when the rst author visits the university of adelaide. s. jiang is with the school of automatic, southeast university, nanjing , china;

a non-zero value indicating the existence of objects with the value denoting the local object density. in fact, for the density maps of many images, a signicant portion of pixels will only take the zero value. the above observation suggests that the density map es- timation implicitly involves two steps: estimating whether a pixel belongs to the foreground or background (object/non- object) and estimating the density value of the foreground region. certainly, these two steps can be achieved by a single density map estimator which is trained with the traditional regression objectives, e.g., mean square error, as in the existing approaches. however, in this paper, we argue the benets of explicitly separating the mask prediction from the density estimation. more specically, we propose to use a dedicated branch of a network to rst predict the foreground/background mask, and then fuse the prediction with the input image to produce the nal density map estimation. the motivation of this strategy is that the rst step is essentially a binary segmentation problem and it can be better trained with seg- mentation loss such as cross-entropy loss. on the other hand, conditioned on the prediction of the mask, the estimation of the density map can be simpler than its unconditioned counterpart. consequently, the overall regression quality could be improved. the critical question of the above-proposed process is how to incorporate the mask prediction information into the density map estimator. in this paper, we study ve different variants for achieving this incorporation. specically, in the proposed ve solutions, we consider the following factors and their combinatorial effects: the representation of mask information. should we use the binary form of the mask prediction or the predicted mask posterior, i.e., the probability of a pixel being the foreground. the way to incorporate the mask information. by simply multiplying the estimated mask or fusing this part of information with a neural network. we analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, the pros and cons of the proposed methods and identify the last one as our best solution. more specically, in this solution, we feed the estimated object posterior into a few convolutional layers and together with the information from the input image to produce the nal density map. through extensive experiments on ve public datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over the competitive baseline and show that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art crowd counting performance. arxiv:v jun ieee transactions on circuits and systems for video technology in sum, the contributions of this paper are threefold: we propose a strategy to separately model the fore- ground/background mask with a dedicated neural network branch and training objective. we study ve different solutions of incorporating the mask prediction information into the overall density map estimation and identify the most effective one. the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art crowd counting performance on various datasets.","Crowd counting is a challenging problem in multimedia and computer vision, aiming to count objects like people in images or video frames.

"to date, many approaches have been proposed to study the issues existing in crowd counting , . here we present a brief review of the related work. for a more detailed survey of crowd counting, we refer the readers to , , . detection seems to be a straightforward solution for crowd counting. the most early methods use hand-crafted features such as haar wavelets , histogram oriented gradients to model the pedestrian, which are then fed to classiers to distinguish whether there is pedestrian or not. initially, , studied the monocular pedestrian detection by a diverse set of low-level feature-based systems. although monocular- based methods work well in a low density region, the perfor- mance is severely affected when they meet the crowded scenes with occlusion and scene clutter. to further consider this issue, more information of the pedestrian is taken into account. zhao et al. used multiple partially occluded human hypotheses in a bayesian framework to build a model-based approach to interpret the image observations. the authors in extracted the foreground and then aggregated the obtained silhouettes over a network to compute bounds about the crowd number and locations. nevertheless, the representation ability of the low-level features is limited, which cannot be applied in many real scenarios. recently, many approaches resort to application of the cnn-based detectors such as faster rcnn , yolo , ssd , which are trained end to end and have a good generalization compared with the traditional ones. these methods make a great progress in terms of detection performance and speed. however, for a heavily occluded and cluttered scenario, accurately detecting each object instance is still very difcult. as a alternative solution of the detection-based methods, the regression-based approaches are proposed to tackle the extremely dense crowds. initially, these approaches learn a mapping or relation between the features of local patches and the counts. actually, they avoid learning some independent detectors. for example, the authors proposed to cast the crowd counting problem as a density map estimation problem. the integral of the image density over any image region gives the count of objects within that region. it was shown that the density map regression framework offers a robust crowd counting solution for various challenging scenarios, and since then it becomes the mainstream framework for this problem. various extensions have been proposed to further improve the training and prediction of density maps. ma et al. studied an integer programming method for estimating the instantaneous count of pedestrians crossing a line of interest in a video sequence. idrees et al. argued that it is not reliable by only using one single feature or detection method for counting task when facing the high- level density crowds. and they also reported that the spatial relationship is an importance information to constrain the counts in neighboring local regions. chen et al. studied the challenges of inconsistent features along with sparse and imbalanced data, and proposed to learn a regression model by using cumulative attribute-based representation. with the breakthrough of deep learning in the past years, most recent works on crowd counting are based on convolu- tional neural networks. the authors in built an end-to-end cnn regression model to count the people in extremely crowd scenes. in the same year, proposed a deep cnn method, which is trained alternatively with two related learning objec- tives, crowd density estimation, and crowd count estimation. later, introduced a cnn architecture that is fed with a whole image and directly outputs the nal count. to address the large variations in people or head size, exploited a multi-column neural network by using receptive elds of different sizes in each column. the authors proposed a path switching architecture, called switching- cnn, to deal with the variation of object density within a scene. in order to gain better performance, proposed a contextual pyramid cnn by incorporating different levels of contextual information to achieve state-of-the-art performance. at the same time, more recent works , have gained promising results and advanced the development of crowd counting. in this paper, we propose a mask-aware network for crowd counting which incorporates the background/foreground mask information into the network for more accurate density re- gression. in terms of the network architecture design, our network is somehow similar to the recent work , which utilizes the top-down feedback to correct the initial prediction. however, our approach considers the background/foreground mask information and we will show later in the experiments that this consideration is crucial for achieving our good per- formance. in terms of using mask information, there has been some successful cases in the areas of object segmentation and person re-identication , . however, to our knowledge, our work is the rst one that systematically studies the effect of mask-aware networks for crowd counting.","Numerous approaches have been proposed for crowd counting, with early methods using hand-crafted features and classifiers for monocular pedestrian detection. More recent methods utilize CNN-based detectors for improved detection performance. Regression-based approaches have emerged as an alternative, with a focus on mapping features to counts, particularly through density map estimation. Deep learning has revolutionized crowd counting, with recent works predominantly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Various CNN architectures have been introduced to address challenges such as varying object sizes and densities within scenes. The text also mentions the development of a mask-aware network for crowd counting, which incorporates background/foreground mask information to improve density regression accuracy. This approach is unique in systematically studying the effects of mask-aware networks in crowd counting, setting it apart from previous work in object segmentation and person re-identification."
"a. density map estimation before elaborating the design of our network, we rst briey introduce the creation of the ground-truth density maps and the related training losses. this paper considers the case that a point-wise annotation is provided for training images. specically, a dot is annotated within each object-of-interest, i.e., people head. this pointwise annotation is further converted into a density map: d = x xia g(x xi ), ieee transactions on circuits and systems for video technology fig. an overview of our proposed method. it contains three modules: the backbone, the mask prediction branch and the mask-aware density regression branch. where x rdenotes the image coordinate and xi denotes the annotated head location. g( xxi ) denotes a gaussian kernel with xi as the mean vector and as the empirically chosen variance term. a typical choice of will make g( xxi ) = if x is not within the local neighborhood of xi. it is also easy to verify that the integral of d over x equals to the total number of objects. thus the counting problem can be cast as a density regression problem and the mean square loss is usually employed to train the regressor: lr = x x d) , where f is the regression network and denotes the model parameters. b. method overview the overview of the proposed method is shown in figure for the clarity of presentation, we divide the network into three parts: a backbone subnetwork b, a mask prediction branch g and the mask-aware density regressor r. the backbone generates the feature representation of the input image and is shared across all the mask-aware density regressors as discussed below. the mask prediction branch predicts the fore- ground/background mask. the mask-aware density regressor is the key contribution of this paper and ve different designs will be presented in this section. as mentioned in the introduction section, the value of d takes two possible states: with a zero value indicating no object around while with a nonzero value indicating the existence of object, and for a large portion of x its corresponding d is zero. this observation inspires us to design a dedicated branch of a neural network to predict the foreground/background mask and we train this branch as a binary segmentation network. then we can utilize the mask prediction information to guide the overall density estimation. formally this process is denoted as g, b), where i denotes the input image and the training objective can be written as: lm , m) + lr , b), d) , where lm is the loss function for evaluating the perfor- mance of mask prediction; lr is the loss function for evaluat- ing the overall density estimation; m, d are the groundtruth of the mask and the density map, respectively. the ground- truth mask is dened as m = sign). more specif- ically, the mask is used to distinguish the background and foreground, which means the threshold is that is, if the counting number of each pixel is greater than , the pixel is then classied to , otherwise, (i.e., background); is a trade-off parameter. c. backbone sub-network the architecture of the backbone sub-network is shown in figure . it consists of two parts. the rst part is a typical multi-layer cnn and the second part is similar to the blocks in the inception network . the layers of rst part are c-c-mp-c-c- mp-c where c denotes the convolution layer with x channels of input, y channels of output and z z convolution kernel and mp denotes max pooling. the second part has two identical units (the structure of each unit is shown in figure ) and its purpose is to encourage the network using information from different scales. this is in a spirit similar to the design of multi-column cnn (mcnn ). however, our backbone only adopts multiple scale paths at the second part and uses the separable convolution layers( and ) as shown in figure . one empirically suggests that the backbone is completely superior to mcnn in terms of the performance . the above proposed sub-network is a light-weight strategy which is completely trained from scratch. to further verify the following proposed solution is not specialized for the proposed sub-network, we also employ a pre-trained vgg model as our backbone to train our solution followed by the state-of- the-art model csrnet . d. mask prediction branch the mask prediction branch consists of multiple convolu- tional layers. specically, the architecture could be denoted as c-c. in our implementation, we can train the mask prediction branch with focal loss as the training objective lm. it is calculated by applying the sigmoid function to the output activation of the mask prediction branch. as reported in , focal loss is designed ieee transactions on circuits and systems for video technology fig. the architecture of the backbone subnetwork. m denotes pooling operation and c denotes concatenation of the features. to tackle the imbalance between foreground and background during training.in most crowd scenarios, there may exist the imbalance issues. but we nd it does not make much difference in our experiment when using the focal loss and traditional binary cross-entropy loss, which will be reported in section iv. here, we use focal loss as a general setting for cross-entropy loss. that is, lm is binary cross-entropy loss when = note that traditional single branch density map estimation networks still need to determine whether a pixel belongs to the foreground or background. they achieve this capability by using the mse loss while our mask pre- diction branch utilizes the cross-entropy loss (with the focal loss) which is generally considered as a better objective for segmentation tasks. e. mask-aware density density regressor the ways of incorporating the mask prediction information into the density regression are critical in our proposed method. in the following part, we consider ve possible solutions. solution by denition, the mask indicates which part of density should be nonzero/zero. thus a straightforward way to fuse mask information with the density map estimation is to elementwisely multiply the estimated density map by the estimated mask. our rst solution uses this scheme, as shown in figure . at the training stage, the training goal of the mask prediction branch to produce the ground-truth mask. thus we directly multiply the density map from the density estimation branch with the ground-truth mask at the training stage. note that this solution essentially requires the density estimation branch only focuses on the estimation of the density in the foreground region. while being conceptually straightforward, this solution, however, ignores the possible connection between the mask prediction branch and density estimation branch. noted that the gradient of the lr will not pass through the mask predic- tion branch at the training time. this suggests that these two branches are essentially trained independently with separated objectives. solution to facilitate the connection between the prediction branch and the density estimation branch, we modify solution fig. five different architectures for the mask-aware density regressor. , and use element-wise product to incorporate the predicted mask information, where uses the groundtruth mask, directly uses the predicted mask posterior and uses ste function to backpropagate the gradient; and fuse the information from predicted mask by several convolutional layers, where uses groundtruth mask but using predicted mask for test, and learns the mask-image features from the output of mask prediction in an end-to-end fashion. and propose the second solution as shown in figure . the difference is that instead of using the ground-truth mask we use the estimated posterior of the foreground (the soft version of the mask prediction) to multiply the output of the density estimation branch. in this case, the gradient loss lr can backpropagate to the mask prediction branch, making it jointly adapt with the density estimation branch to produce the nal estimation. solution in solution , the nal density prediction is the multiplication of the posterior and the output of the density estimation branch. since the value of the posterior is between and it is not a perfect mask and could make the estimation sensitive to the condence of mask prediction. to overcome this drawback, we propose to multiply the predicted binary mask instead. the generation of the mask involves a non- differentiable hard-thresholding operation. to backpropagate ieee transactions on circuits and systems for video technology the gradient, we adopt the straight-through estimator (ste for short) to approximate this operator as shown in figure . formally, in the forward calculation, the predicted mask used in the multiplication is obtained via mi = h), where h returns if the p is greater than , otherwise in backpropagation, we approximate the gradient as mi ) the schematic illustration of this solution is shown in figure . solution the above two designs are based on the el- ementwise product operation to merge the information of mask prediction, which can be quite restrictive and potentially sensitive to the mask prediction quality. here we propose an alternative solution as shown in figure . the idea is to use several convolutional layers to map the mask into a feature map which can be further concatenated with the image features to perform the density estimation. similar to solution , we can use the ground-truth mask at the training time and replace it with the predicted ones at the test stage. in this design, we use one channel of ground truth mask to generate a feature map with channels, and then we concatenate the channels from previous layers as the input for the last density map regressor. finally, the architecture of the density map regressor is c-c-c. solution similar to the solution , we could further improve solution by using the estimated posterior probability to replace the predicted mask. this allows joint training of all the components of the network. the structure of this solution is shown in figure . since this structure learns the incorporation operation through a set of convolutional layers rather than a simple elementwise product, we postulate that it can be less sensitive to the value of posterior estimation. f. implementation details our proposed method is trained from scratch based on the pytorch framework. firstly, we generate the ground truth following from previous method by using a gaussian kernel. we x the kernel size for all datasets to generate the density map although using geometry-adaptive kernel for different datasets might further improve prediction performance. for the proposed multi-scale backbone shown in figure , we randomly mirror the cropped training images and their associated gt on the y. whats more, the initialization of the network is drawn from normal distribution with standard deviation. in order to gain a quicker training speed, the adam optimizer is used to train the network before th epoch and then switch to mini-batch stochastic gradient descent . the learning rate is initially set to e- and then is decreased by a factor of every epochs. as for using pre-trained vgg as backbone, we use original images as training dataset without data augmentation unless otherwise stated. in our experiments, we use sgd optimizer train the network for the datasets with different size of images and the rest ones use adam optimizer. in addition, we use standard cross-entropy loss for all the experiments.","The proposed method in the text introduces a technique for estimating density maps in crowd scenarios using neural networks. The method involves creating ground-truth density maps from point-wise annotations, converting them into density maps using Gaussian kernels, and training a network comprising a backbone, mask prediction branch, and mask-aware density regression branch. The network is divided into multiple parts, with the backbone generating image features, the mask prediction branch predicting foreground/background masks, and the density regressor incorporating mask information for accurate density estimation. Various approaches are presented for integrating mask prediction information into density regression, with experiments conducted to validate the method's effectiveness. The implementation details include training the method from scratch using the PyTorch framework, utilizing different optimization strategies, and adapting the network architecture for diverse datasets."
"in this section, we conduct experiments on three challenging public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness our proposed method including shanghaitech dataset , ucf cc dataset and worldexpo dataset . the purposes of our experiments are threefold: verify if the proposed mask-aware strategies lead to signicant improvement over the baselines. identify the most effective mask-aware den- sity estimation solution. compare our proposed approach against the state-of-the-art methods. in our experiments, we use shanghaitech dataset a to achieve the rst and the second objective. the identied best-performed solution will then be compared against the state-of-the-art on all three datasets. in what follows, we present the evaluation criterion and datasets in our experiments. then we present a detailed anal- ysis of the proposed solutions and identify the most effective one. finally, we compare our method with other state-of-the- art methods. a. evaluation metrics we use mean absolute error and mean square error as the evaluation metrics. the two metrics are dened as follows: mae = n n x i= |pri gti| and mse = v u u t n n x i= , where n is the number of the images in the test dataset, and pri denotes the predicted object count obtained from the network for the i-th image while gti denotes the ground truth count of the i-th image. more specically, pri equals to the sum of values in the estimated density map. b. datasets shanghaitech dataset. this is a large-scale crowd counting dataset, which contains images with , annotated heads. it is split into two parts: part a has images randomly collected from the internet including images for training and the rest for testing, and part b contains images taken from busy streets of metropolitan in shanghai, and with images for training and the remaining images for testing. we randomly crop patches from each training image with the resolution of ucf cc dataset. the ucf cc dataset has only images captured from various perspectives, which is a very challenging counting dataset introduced by . on average, it contains persons per image ranging from to we crop patches from each image to train both methods as this dateset is too small, and followed by , -fold cross- validation is used to evaluate our proposed method. worldexpo the worldexpo is the largest cross- scene crowd counting dataset introduced by , . it

from shanghai worldexpo. there are frames uniformly sampled from the videos sequences, where frames are used for training and the rest for testing. the number of pedestrians ranges from to different from the above datasets, the region of interest is provided for the images in the dataset. during data preprocessing, we mask each frame and its corresponding density map with roi. c. analysis of the proposed approaches this paper proposes ve different designs for the mask- aware density regressor. its effectiveness will be examined in this subsection. we use solution - to denote the proposed architectures shown in figure besides these solutions, we also compare our method against three baselines (baseline - ) to verify the benet of introducing mask-aware network design. the baselines are: baseline is a simply backbone subnetwork plus the density estimation branch as in solution - the purpose of presenting this baseline is to examine if adding mask branch and mask-aware density regressor can indeed lead to improvement. baseline is a deeper version of baseline we notice that our solution and essentially use deeper networks for density regression. thus it is fair to compare against a baseline with the comparable depth. the experiment results of the above methods are summa- rized in table from the results, we could make the following observations. the proposed solution does not lead to the improved performance over baseline which is comparable to it in terms of the network depth. on the contrary, it worsens the density estimation performance. in comparison, solution leads to signicant performance improvement. comparing with baseline , it reduces the estimation error by in mae and mse. this observation suggests that it is inappropriate to treat the mask prediction and density prediction independently. it is crucial to train those two tasks jointly. somewhat surprising, the proposed solution has no signicant improvement. we postulate that it is due to the difculty in optimizing the non-differentiable operator despite the fact that we have already approximated it by the straight- through estimator. solution also leads to an improved performance over baselines, although the improvement over its comparable method, baseline , is marginal. note that solution does not utilize the joint training strategy and the mask-aware density regressor will receive different mask inputs (ground truth and predicted) at the training and testing stage respectively. however, this limit does not prevent the method from gaining performance improvement. this may suggest that using con- volutional layers to combine the mask prediction information is more robust than the elementwise product. our last solution further achieves signicant perfor- mance improvement over solution and baseline it reduces the mae from in baseline to . this again shows the benet of joint training and the power of using convolutional layers for information fusion. d. ablation study to have more insights into our proposed method, we con- duct ablation studies of the proposed method on the part one of shanghaitech a dataset. the main studies and ndings are presented below. to understand the effect of segmentation branch, we set a new baseline . this baseline uses identical network structure as our solution , but replaces the target of the mask prediction by density regression. in this way, the structure is similar to that in . this baseline is to verify whether the improvement of the proposed method merely comes from the architecture, or the mask prediction objective. from table ii, it is not hard to conclude that our best- performed solution still achieves signicant improvement over baseline recall that the difference between solution and baseline is that the former adopts the mask prediction as the training objective. the performance discrepancy of these two methods suggests that using mask information could indeed benet the density estimation. the improvement of our method does not solely come from the network structure. in figure , we also visualize the estimated density maps of our best-performed method and baseline approaches. from , it is interesting to nd that although the proposed approach gives more accurate count estimation, it does not provide a visibly better foreground/background separation than the baselines. this may suggest that the benet of introducing the mask objective is not as simple as providing a better foreground/background separation. we postulate that the better performance achieved by our approach is due to that its density value estimation becomes more accurate with the guidance of the mask prediction. we also conduct a comparison experiment between binary cross entropy loss and focal loss. the result shows that the network with binary cross entropy loss can achieve almost ieee transactions on circuits and systems for video technology fig. a comparison of the density map generated by our best-performed method and two baselines in shanghaitech part a. the same performance: mae: , mse: compared with that of the solution so focal loss in this paper is a general setting for the mask branch. to compare the considered model with different back- bones, we construct a new network with the same network structure in the solution on top of a recent state-of-the-art network . to distinguish our proposed baseline, we term this network as our method csr for short. as shown in table ii, we can see our method csr can achieve a promising improvement over the original csrnet. to some extent, it indicates that a good baseline with the exploited network structure can boost the performance. also note that the pre- trained model can be easily trained in a simple setting as shown in sec. iii compared to our proposed model trained from scratch. we argue that the main benets derives from the pre-trained vgg compared with csrnet, our proposed baseline is more computationally efcient. to show the interactions among the roi mask, input and density regression, we visualize the feature maps among those layers in figure we use the test images) in the part a of shanghaitech dataset.we nd that there exist mask errors after the sigmoid layer of the segmentation branch as shown in figure we randomly selected one feature map after feeding back the predicted mask posterior. interestingly, from figure , it can be seen that the errors in the mask prediction are suppressed in the sampled feature map. this suggests that the network has the capability of separating the error pattern at the mask prediction stage into different feature maps and potentially suppressing the error signal for density estimation. after the fusion of the two branches, each feature map in the regressor only focuses on a small part of the interest region shown in figure from the above discussion, we can see that even though there exist mask errors in the mask branch, they will not magnify in the next stage. finally, we get a rened density map as shown in figure here we argue that the mask error will not magnify in the next stage. as is known, there are different density levels in the crowd. so we conduct the comparative experiment with three levels on shanghaitech part a to show the improvement of our method. we split the density into three types of crowd: low crowd , middle crowd and high crowd. from figure , it is easily concluded that the proposed method achieves a promising result on the low and middle level of crowd. this is because the proposed segmentation branch has the ability to discriminate background and foreground. as for high-level crowd, it poses a challenging situation for most methods. the texture information of the crowd people are missing in those scenes so it is really hard to exact robust features for each head. as a result, we can not see clear ieee transactions on circuits and systems for video technology fig. the visualization of feature maps in the mask branch. is the input image; is the output in segmentation branch; is randomly selected feature map from the feedback convolution layers of the segmentation branch; is randomly selected feature map after concatenating the feedback of segmentation branch; is the nal predicted density map. fig. the average mae of different density levels tested on shanghaitech part a. promotion in this interval. as for the our method with pre- trained model, we can see that it has a similar improvement in low and middle crowds compared to the model with the proposed backbone while it also achieves a good result in high crowd. we conjecture that the pre-trained backbone has more prior knowledge to capture the texture information in high density level crowd than the model trained from scratch. e. comparison with the state-of-the-art we further compare our best-performed solution against the state-of-the-art results in various datasets. firstly, we make a comparison on the part a and part b of the shanghaitech dataset. we compare our method against cc-counting , fcn , mcnn, tdf-net , switching-net , (ba- net for short), netvlad , cp-cnn and csrnet . the results are summarized in table we can see that our method also achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods and while keeping economic parameters. it is noted that the number of parameters of our proposed method is less than million while the number in the cp-cnn is million. so our method is more parameter economic and potentially more efcient. as for our method csr surpasses the two methods signicantly in this dataset. specically, the mae of part a is , which outperforms that of the csrnet by about . in terms of the mse, our proposed method shows signicant improvement over csrnet by %. in part b, we also see that our method csr achieves % in mae and % in mse improvement compared to csrnet on part b. these results show the benets of our proposed strategy in such a high variance scene. in addition, we report the results of our approach on ucf cc dataset in table our method obtains a improvement in mae over cp-cnn but is worse than csr- net. we argue that the main reason lies in that the pre- trained model enjoys more prior information compared with our model trained from scratch especially in such a small dataset. instead, our model csr armed with pre-trained vgg is superior to other models in mae. it should be noted that it shows and improvement over csrnet in terms of mae and mse, respectively. finally, we present the results of our method on the world- expo dataset as shown in table v. our method with light weight achieves a relatively good performance which is on par with the state-of-the-art methods like tdf-net, netvlad, and classical methods mcnn and cc- counting but it is inferior to csrnet and cp-cnn. besides, our model csr precedes csrnet and cp-cnn while obtaining the rst place in s, s and s scenes.","The section presents experiments conducted on three challenging public datasets to verify the effectiveness of a proposed method involving mask-aware strategies for crowd counting. The experiments aim to compare performance against baselines, identify the most effective density estimation solution, and assess the method against state-of-the-art approaches. Evaluation metrics include mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE), with analyses performed on datasets like shanghaitech and ucf cc. Different approaches are compared, highlighting the importance of jointly training mask prediction and density estimation. The proposed method demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines and competes well with state-of-the-art methods on various datasets. Ablation studies and comparisons with different backbones further support the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving accurate crowd counting results with economic parameters."

recently, registration methods based on deep networks have been developed that use classier tech- nology to synthesize deep metrics for registration . simonovsky et al. proposed an application specic deep metric based on convolutional neu- ral networks . although they showed superior performance compared to mi for deformable registration, they require well-registered training data, i.e., the method is fully supervised. balakrishnan et al. presented voxelmorph, an unsupervised approach, where registration is modeled as a parametric function using cnns. during training, the model parameters are optimized by maximiz- ing image similarity which does not require ground truth registration. however, the similarity metric in voxelmorph is designed for intra-modality registration. in another work, hu et al. described a weakly supervised approach where sparse corresponding landmarks are used to summarize the underlying dense de- formation, with good results on the registration of prostate mr and ultrasound. we propose a new approach, deep information theoretic registration , that uses iterated maximum likelihood to train eective application spe- cic deep image metrics. we show that this approach is strongly related to mi, but on patches, not pixels. this alleviates one of the main limitations of the mi approach, namely the strong implicit independence assumption on pix- els or voxels. in addition, we show that in our method, neither landmarks nor well-registered training data are required for learning the deep metric. this is an important issue in some applications e.g., mri and ultrasound, as it is not practical to perform simultaneous scanning, so that with soft tissues, accurate alignment of the training data is unlikely. the remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section describes the relationship between maximum likelihood and information theoretic registration methods. in section , we describe achieving ml registration us- ing classication. next we demonstrate that the need for accurately registered training data is relaxed by using iml with deep classier technology. finally, in section we evaluate our proposed method for multi-modality image regis- tration, and explore data augmentation techniques that also help to obviate the need for accurately registered training data. maximum likelihood registration before introducing the relation between deep image metrics and mi registration, we provide a brief history of ml and mi based registration methods. given that ml is older than it, it is perhaps interesting that ml registration appeared after mi, in . we write ml registration of a xed image u and moving image v as = argmax ln p(u, v ; , ) = argmax x i ln p(ui, vi; , ) .","The paper proposes a new approach called deep information theoretic registration, which uses deep metric-based image registration techniques. It establishes a framework that shows equivalence between maximum profile likelihood and minimization of joint entropy. The approach does not require well-registered training data, making it applicable in weak supervision scenarios. It outperforms mutual information in image registration tasks, especially with images of different contrasts. The method addresses limitations of previous information theoretic registration approaches by working on patches instead of pixels. This work enables general-purpose registration in challenging applications and shows promise for improving registration performance in various scenarios."
"here, are transformation parameters, and are known modeling parameters, that might have been previously estimated from training data containing reg- istered images. we also assume that the images are collections of conditionally independent features, ui, vi. we model the joint distribution on model features as p pr . here, v is shorthand for t where t is spatial transformation applied to the feature v. pr is intended as a joint distribution on features when registered. in the present work, we suppress jacobian eects, eectively assuming that volume is approximately preserved. the parameters of this model could be estimated from training data consisting of registered images. then, = argmax x i pr(ui, vi; ) . this approach was used by leventon et al. . in that work, the features were image pixels or voxels and the joint distribution was categorical. the model was estimated by histogramming from pairs of registered images. this need for pre- registered training data is a drawback in comparison to mi. maximum likelihood registration, unknown parameters to proceed without training data, we could simultaneously optimize the model parameters when registering images. if we view the model parameters as nuisance parameters, this approach has been called maximum prole likelihood . d , = argmax , ln p . here bayesians may favor averaging over the nuisance parameters. the two ap- proaches are compared in . in the context of registration, the marginalization approach was described by zollei et al. . we use the prole likelihood ap- proach in the remainder of this paper. special case: registration by minimization of joint entropy we ex- amine here the special case, as used in , where the features are pixels, and the model is categorical. let the joint image intensities be discretized into bins that have a single index, calculated by the function: i. suppose ui, vi are dis- tributed according to a categorical distribution: i| cat; ) where cat = i, i , and p i i = then, = argmax max x i ln i = argmax max x j nj ln j . where i sums over all corresponding pairs of image intensities, nj is the count of data items in bin j, and j sums over the bins. note that the expression sedghi et al. in brackets is the objective function for maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the categorical distribution. it is easy to show, using la grange multipliers, that the expression is maximized when j = nj n where n . = p i ni. then , = argmax x j nj n ln nj n = argmin h  cat nj n  . thus the optimization over has devolved exactly to minimization of joint entropy. this historically signicant objective function: adjust the registration so that the entropy of the joint histogram is minimized somewhat predates mi, they dier by

were described in . maximum likelihood registration by classier in this section, we show how to use image classication to generate an agreement metric for solving registration problems. here a classier is trained to distinguish between registered and unregistered patches. we use training data in form of {}, where ui and vi are features, or patches, and zi {, }. we construct the data to

logit transform of p(zi = |ui, vi; ), also that the logit transform is the inverse of . then using eq. , and noting that the nal term is a constant, ln p = ln) + f + c . for the purpose of ml registration, we construct the joint distribution on patches conditioned on a transformation with parameters as follows: p(ui, vi; , ) p(ui, vi|zi = ; ) . sedghi et al. taking log, and using eq. , ln p(ui, vi; , ) = ln p(u, vi|zi = ) + f + c . we argue that the rst term on the right above is constant in , because, in the zi = case, ui and vi are independent by assumption, we further assume that p is spatially stationary. then, we obtain ml registration as = argmax x i ln p(ui, vi; , ) argmax x i f(ui, vi, ) . this ml objective function is simply the sum of the pre-sigmoid network re- sponses over the corresponding patches in the pair of images being registered; it is our approach to dmr. unsupervised registration by iterated maximum likelihood while dmr has proven useful, it is assumed that well-registered training data is needed. to relax this requirement, we use the iml approach of eqns. and ; in this context the training is over features in collections of images, n+ = argmax x i ln p argmax x i f(ui, vi, n) and, n+ = argmax x i ln p(ui, vi, n, ) argmax x i ln p(zi|u, nvi; ) . eq. amounts to estimating the transformation parameters of a collection of pairs of images using the deep metric with known model parameters, n. eq. corresponds to retraining the network using patches that are oset by the most recently estimated transformation parameters. the iteration is started with eq. on the original roughly registered training data. subsequently, the method alternates between re-aligning the data and re-estimating the deep network pa- rameters. in the experimental portion of the paper, three iterations are applied in training. we envision that this iterative training needs to happen only once per application type. after training, the model parameters may be xed and used for subsequent registrations using eq. experimental evaluation we perform several experiments to study the eectiveness of iml approach for several image registration tasks. we introduce dithering as a tool to help demonstrate that the proposed approach does not require perfectly aligned train- ing data to learn an accurate deep metric. to generate unregistered datasets, we perturb the moving images with a random transformation. we select land- marks in the image space to calculate and report mean fiducial registration error following registration. we compare our method to mi, a metric deep information theoretic registration used often for multi-modality image registration, as well as multi-scale mi reg- istration . in all of our experiments, we use powells method for optimization of the transformation parameters with the learned deep metric as a cost function. data we carried out experiments using the ixi brain development dataset which contains aligned t-t image pairs from healthy subjects. in our experiments, we use subjects for training and another subjects for validation. all images are resampled to mm, and their intensity is normalized between the range of . we crop d patches, ui, vi, of size containing a mix of registered pairs of patches with zi = (cropped from the same location in image space), and randomly uniformly unregistered pairs with zi = overall, million patches are generated for each experiment. dithering training a deep metric on unregistered dataset can cause bias in the response function depending on the distribution of the mis-registration in the data. for example, if the moving images were shifted in the x direction, the response function will have a peak that is shifted accordingly . data augmentation with rotation and ipping can help reduce this bias at a cost of introducing additional variance and peaks in the response function. a smooth, single peak response function is preferred for eective optimization and learning of the transformation parameters. traditionally, this could be reme- died via image smoothing, however we show below that with dmr, smoothing is ineective. therefore, we propose dithering as an eective alternative ap- proach to merge the multiple modes of the response function. more specically, we deliberately introduce noise by applying d gaussian distributed random displacements to the moving image prior to cropping patches v v where d n and is the standard deviation of the dither. network architecture and training for learning a similarity metric for image registration, we use d cnns and train the networks as discriminative classiers to distinguish between registered and unregistered image patches in our experiments. the architecture of our network is inspired by the -channel network of zagouruko et al. where patches from the xed and moving images are the input channels of the cnn. the network has a -layer architecture consisting of strided d convolutions of size and relu activation functions followed by an average pooling layer and a sigmoid. cnn training and registration we train our model by minimizing cross- entropy loss. during training, a learning rate of , batch size of and -regularization of is used to optimize the network. fol- lowing training, we use the sum of the pre-sigmoid network responses over the patches in the pair of images being registered as our cost function for opti- mization to update the transformation parameters. the process of training and sedghi et al. transformation update may be iterated if necessary to improve registration of the training data. experiments experiment : rigid and ane registration in this experiment, we demon- strate the eectiveness of iml approach in learning a deep metric from roughly registered pairs of images. in addition, we evaluate the contribution of dither- ing to registration by comparing the performance of iml with and without dithering. first, we perform a rigid registration experiment where we perturb the moving images by applying a random rigid transformation with parameters sampled from a d uniform distribution of ut{, } mm and u{, } rad for translation and rotation, respectively. we propose iterations of iml as iml iml iml where iml represents training a model with images that are donwnsampled by factor of l and moving images dithered with a variance of downsampling is needed because large initial mis-registrations cannot be captured by the limited patch size. furthermore, we experiment with ane registration to show the capabil- ity of iml in a more general registration problem. we perturb the moving images by applying a random transformation with parameters sampled from ut{, }, u{, }, us{, } and ush{, } for translation, ro- tation, scale and shear, respectively. we follow the stage iml model proposed earlier to learn the deep metrics. we also characterize the deep metric learned from the roughly registered data as a function of translation for a test data (be- fore perturbation), following each iteration of iml, to illustrate the nature of the objective functions. experiment : eect of dithering on response function in order to experimentally verify the value of dithering as a way to merge the modes of the response function, we compare three methods of training on data where moving images are systematically shifted mm in the x direction. this is meant to sim- ulate a situation that could occur if there were a consistent dierence in setup between non-simultaneous scanning of dierent image modalities. these three methods are: training a model on the shifted data, without any augmentation and dithering training a model on the same data, with augmentation, with- out dithering, and training a model on the same data, with augmentation and dithering. in another experiment, to compare dithering and smoothing for broadening the response function, we perform an experiment in which we learn a deep metric on the dithered and smoothed data separately. experiment : edge registration we test our proposed iml approach in a more dicult multi-modality situation. more specically, we experiment with registration of edge maps of the t images (extracted by the canny edge detector) to intensities in t images. we apply the edge detector to the same data that was used in the rigid registration experiment, and follow iterations of iml to learn the deep metric, iml iml iml deep information theoretic registration fig. box plots of mean fre for rigid and ane registration between t and t images. results and discussion fig. shows box plots of mean fre for dierent experiments performed for rigid and ane registration. each box represents the interquartile range, and the horizontal line is the median of the distribution of mean fre. as seen in fig. a, iml with dithering performs statistically signicantly better than iml without dithering , and mi . moreover, fig. b demonstrates the eectiveness of iml with dithering for ane regis- tration compared to mi . for both registration tasks, iml without dithering improves the initial registration error to some extent which further demonstrates the added value of dithering for learning deep metrics from unreg- istered datasets. fig. delineates the deep metric on pairs of images as a function of transla- tion in each iteration of iml. we observe that from the rst iteration, iml, to the last iteration, the response function is sharper and hence the accuracy of the image registration improves. this is likely due to the increased level of align- ment of the training data as the iterations proceed. fig. shows the results of experiment for exploring the eect of dithering on learning deep image metrics. in fig. a, it is clear that there is a bias in the response function due to the systematic shift in the training data. fig. a also shows the eect of augmentation by rotation and ipping in reducing the bias. moreover, we can see that by applying dithering to the moving image before cropping the patches, we are able to merge the peaks in the deep metric. we evaluate the impact of dithering versus smoothing on the broadness of the deep metric in fig. b. it is interesting to note that smoothing has not signicantly broadened the response function. we believe that deep networks sedghi et al. fig. response functions for each iteration of iml for rigid registration plotted as a function of translation for a pair of registered xed and moving images. shading illustrates full-width half max. are capable of eectively learning the correspondence between the smoothed patches; therefore, they can generate a sharp response similar to the response function of the deep metric learned from the original data. we see on the left that dithering is more eective at broadening the response. fig. a depicts sample image pairs from the training dataset for experiment , edge registration, with the initial mis-registration. figure b shows the mean fre using dierent methods. the gure clearly demonstrates the superior per- formance of ditr compared to mi. in the experiments presented, several iterations of iml are needed to learn the best deep metrics, but for registering the test data we only need the nal trained network. we believe this is possible due to the broad capture range of the learned deep metric . conclusion we presented, for the rst time, an information theoretical foundation for iterated maximum likelihood registration with deep image metrics, ditr. we further showed that iml with classier-based metrics is strongly related to mutual information on patches . we expect that ditr will enable new solutions for applications where the standard mi assumption of pixel- or voxel-wise independence is limiting. we demonstrated the eectiveness of our proposed method in rigid and ane regis- tration for multi-modal data. in all experiments, ditr outperformed standard mi statistically signicantly. on the edge-to-image registration experiment, mi eectively failed, but ditr successfully registered the images. our work focused on the analysis of registration objective functions rather than transformation modeling and optimization methods; we expect the tech- nology to be eective in more general settings, as it is a generalization of sim- ilar dmr methods that have been shown to be successful for inter-subject de- formable registration . deep information

"gpus are essential to deep learning. by leveraging substantial parallelism, high memory bandwidth, and tensor acceleration, gpus are able to quickly compute activations over large batches of inputs. nvidias datacenter-class v gpu, for example, packs more than tflop/s of half-precision matrix multiply-and-accumulate performance designed specically for deep learning workloads. as deep learning is deployed in applications ranging from video monitoring, language translation, and speech recognition, there is an emerging need for parallel hardware accelerators to support inference. while there are numerous specialized inference processors, the widespread availability of gpus and their support for general deep learning models renders gpus indispensable for inference. dnn training is computationally expensive but relatively infrequent, while online inference needs to scale to billions of queries per day and is rapidly outpacing training in datacenters . amazon recently announced that roughly % of the machine learning computation is spent on inference . key metrics for revenue-critical applications can dramatically suffer with an increased application latency . in spite of tight end-to-end latency budgets , we note an alarming trend that inference latency on a cpu has been on a rise . the researchers appetite for better accuracy leads to ever-increasing model size and complexity; as an example, the state-of-the-art senet- model has a s cpu inference latency. given that increases in interactive query latencies leads to losses in revenue, cpus cannot support todays interactive model serving workloads which leaves gpus an obvious favorite. while training workloads continue to scale and can often easily saturate modern gpus, ml inference has distinctly different performance requirements that often result in poor gpu utilization. in contrast to throughput-oriented model training, revenue-critical inference workloads must meet preprint. work in progress. arxiv:v dec cpu intel xeon gpu nvidia v s s s s s ms ms ms ms ms ms ms ms ms ms ms slo inference latency alexnet top-: % vgg- top-: % resnet- top-: % densenet- top-: % senet- top-: % figure : dnn model complexity is increasing over time on cpus and gpus. most models fail to meet the ms latency slo on a cpu. models from left- to-right: alexnet , vgg- , resnet- , densenet- and senet- . % % % % % s s s s s s % of peak fp throughput tail latency ms slo bs= bs= bs= figure : in order to meet latency slos, small batch sizes must be used resulting in low gpu utilization. the largest batch size for resnet- within the slo is , but only achieves an average of % of peak v fp throughput. latency objectives with queries often arriving stochastically. in practice, online inference queries often cannot realize the high levels of parallelism that ofine iterative minibatch training achieves; lower parallelism leads to poor gpu utilization in practice. small batch sizes are an unfortunate reality for online inference with slos , which leads to low utilization. the issue raised by small inference batch sizes is exacerbated as model complexity grows over time, pushing gpu inference latencies to approach interactive slos from below (as noted in figure ). given that inference workloads must run continuously and respond to highly variable demand, capacity must be provisioned for demand peaks which lowers gpu utilization even further. the current practice of exclusive access to a gpu cannot scale due to the low utilization on current hardware. we notice that small batch sizes can lead the gpu to low utilization under %. this problem affects other throughput-oriented accelerators; googles tensor processing unit reports an observed throughput under % of the peak on average and under % for some models . a common approach to improving utilization of parallel hardware, under stochastic query load, is to leverage multi-tenancy. by sharing a gpu across multiple prediction workloads we can potentially leverage workload level parallelism and achieve statistical multiplexing. however, leveraging multi- tenancy on a gpu remains an open research problem. first, its runtime performance must be predictable, which, as we show in section , is not always true. second, it must be resource- efcient. to address this, we explore a number of techniques for sharing a gpu among a set of execution kernels, each with their drawbacks. third, a measure of performance-isolation is needed, which is typically achieved through fair resource allocation. current approaches for sharing a gpu for dnn inference either multiplex the gpu across space or across time. section evaluates current approaches against the three criteria established above. we argue that only multiplexing across space or time leads to a compromise on one of these criteria instead, we propose scheduling across space and time for gpu inference in section by packing multiple execution kernels across disjoint dnn graphs with dynamic query batching, we show potential for a multi-tenancy solution that is resource-efcient (> x increase in throughput over state-of-the-art) while providing isolation and predictability.","GPUs are essential for deep learning tasks due to their parallelism, memory bandwidth, and tensor acceleration capabilities. While specialized processors exist for inference, GPUs with their support for general deep learning models are indispensable. The need for hardware accelerators for inference is growing as deep learning applications expand to fields like video monitoring and speech recognition. Inference workloads require low latency and high throughput, a challenge for GPUs optimized for training. Current practices such as exclusive GPU access lead to low utilization and scalability issues. Sharing GPUs among multiple tasks, known as multi-tenancy, presents an opportunity to increase utilization but poses challenges in performance predictability and efficiency. A proposed solution involves scheduling across space and time to improve resource efficiency while maintaining isolation and predictability, leading to a potentially significant increase in throughput."
"consider a cloud-based managed service for deploying ml models for online inference, similar to amazon aws sagemaker or google cloud ml engine . users may develop and upload their trained machine learning models to this service. the service then deploys the model onto one-or-more replicas, which each may use cpus and gpus. the service and the users agree on some service level objective , such as a measure of tail-latency for model inference. we simplify this model in order to isolate interference effects due to multi-tenant execution. first, all models running on a single gpu are restricted to the same architecture . this separates the impact of heterogeneous model architectures from multi-tenancy. second, request queues are always saturated, thereby isolating model service latency from request queuing latency. it is worth noting that addressing both model heterogeneity and queuing latency is a key focus of future work.","The text introduces a managed cloud inference service for deploying machine learning models for online inference, akin to services like Amazon AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud ML Engine. Users can develop and upload their trained models to the service, which then deploys them onto replicas with CPUs and GPUs. The service and users agree on service level objectives, such as tail-latency for model inference. To analyze interference effects due to multi-tenant execution, the model is simplified by constraining all models using a single GPU to the same architecture and saturating request queues. Future work will focus on addressing model heterogeneity and queuing latency."
"using this simplied model of a managed cloud inference service, we outline three leading approaches to model inference today: exclusive access. each model has an exclusive gpu. amazon aws sagemaker, google cloud ml engine, clipper and tensorflow serving all utilize this approach. in this approach, inference is done in batches. when the network is performing forward propagation, new queries must wait in a queue until one forward pass is completed. time multiplexing. an on-device scheduler enables interleaved execution of multiple cuda contexts at once. this approach is common when multiple processes run concurrently using the same gpu. this approach relies on the kernel to time-multiplex processes and gpu to swap contexts when different processes compete for the same resource. spatial multiplexing. kernel execution can overlap by utilizing nvidia hyper-q . cuda streams and nvidia multi process service utilize multiple hardware queues to enable spatial sharing of the gpu. the cuda streams api is used by modelbatch and nvidia tensorrt . amds mxgpu is another approach for spatial multiplexing, not considered in this work. in this paper, we consider two kinds of spatial multiplexing: implicit spatial multiplexing with mps: nvidia mps allows multiple processes to run on the device at the same time by allocating them different cuda streams. explicit spatial multiplexing with cuda streams: with this method we directly interact with multiple cuda streams inside a single processes. we examine competitive solutions for each of these model inference approaches to identify if they satisfy our chosen system criteria, namely: latency predictability, resource-efciency, and performance isolation.","Three main approaches to model inference are discussed: exclusive access where each model has a dedicated GPU, time multiplexing which allows for interleaved execution of multiple CUDA contexts, and spatial multiplexing which enables overlapping kernel execution by utilizing NVIDIA Hyper-Q. Spatial multiplexing can be achieved through various methods including NVIDIA MPS for multiple processes to run on the device concurrently, and CUDA streams for interacting with multiple CUDA streams within a single process. The paper evaluates competitive solutions for each approach based on criteria such as latency predictability, resource efficiency, and performance isolation."
"we evaluate these three virtualization methods on two image classication neural network architec- tures: mobilenet v and resnet- . these two models are popular choices for low-compute and high-accuracy classication applications respectively. exclusive access is tested with a single model executing batched queries on a private gpu. although we cannot use this approach with multiple models on a single gpu, this test represents a single-tenant lower bound on latency and an ideal best-case for performance. time multiplexing is tested by running each model in a separate cuda context and utilizing a software scheduler to interleave execution. this provides memory safety and some basic level of isolation between tenants. spatial multiplexing is tested by using the nvidia mps server to partition model queries for different models across a pool of cuda streams. all experiments use pxlarge or pxlarge instances on amazon aws. these instances have direct access to nvidia v datacenter-class gpus with up to tflop/s of single-precision oating-point throughput. we do not test tensor core sharing in our experiments. number of replicas mean latency mobilenet v approach time multiplexing spatial multiplexing exclusive access with batching number of replicas resnet figure : both time and spatial multiplexing do not meet the performance of exclusive access; however, spatial multiplexing is able to deliver better inference latency than time multiplexing. we compare three approaches to gpu multi-tenancy. exclusive access (modeled by batching a single model) provides fast and predictable latencies at a high cost. time multiplexing dramatically increases inference latency as sharing increases. spatial multiplexing through nvidia mps better manages latency by sharing resources.","The text discusses the evaluation of three virtualization methods on two popular image classification neural network architectures: MobileNet V and ResNet. The methods tested are exclusive access, time multiplexing, and spatial multiplexing. Exclusive access, demonstrated by running a single model on a private GPU, sets a lower bound on latency and represents the best-case performance for a single tenant. Time multiplexing involves running models in separate CUDA contexts with a software scheduler to interleave execution. Spatial multiplexing leverages the NVIDIA MPS server to partition model queries across CUDA streams. The experiments were conducted on AWS instances with NVIDIA GPUs. Results show that both time and spatial multiplexing don't match the performance of exclusive access, but spatial multiplexing provides better inference latency than time multiplexing. Overall, exclusive access offers fast and predictable latencies at a high cost, time multiplexing significantly increases latency with increased sharing, and spatial multiplexing effectively manages latency by sharing resources through NVIDIA MPS."
"we report results from our benchmark in figure for both mobilenet v (compute-optimized model) and resnet- , we tested batched exclusive access, time multiplexing, and spatial multiplexing. batched exclusive access devotes the entire gpu to a single model, unlike the other two approaches. this is an extremely aggressive baseline and represents the ideal performance a model would achieve if it were the only tenant and throughput is our only objective. however, if we also wanted to minimize latency we would likely use much smaller batch sizes. overall, time-only multiplexing suffers a geometric mean x slowdown compared to exclusive access while space-only multiplexing only endures a x slowdown, across the experiments in figure ultimately, no single solution wins on all criteria we established in section replicas replicas replicas figure : implicit spatial multiplexing (with mps) has unpredictable latency when differ- ent number of processes are running concur- rently. as we add replicas to a gpu running multi-tenant models, we observe unpredictabil- ity, which we suspect is caused by the on-device scheduler. number of replicas mean latency approach explicit spatial multiplexing implicit spatial multiplexing time multiplexing figure : both time and implicit spatial mul- tiplexing are bounded by memory. explicit spatial multiplexing is not. in this experiment, most approaches hit a gb memory wall at replicas, at which point gpu memory was exhausted; however, explicit spatial multiplexing , was able to scale up to at least resnet- models. exclusive access, as discussed, allows for high-throughput, low-latency, isolation, and predictability, but is extremely expensive, since it does not share the gpu at all. as we note in figure , this increase in performance comes at a tradeoff - namely that online inference workloads must endure low gpu utilization in order to meet these tight latency slos. we believe this is a great model for users who have high enough request rates during inference to achieve good utilization on a gpu and are able to batch requests to arrive simultaneously into one forward pass of the network. time multiplexing can actually accomplish multi-tenancy with good isolation and predictability, but at the cost of degraded throughput and high latencies. the main drawback to this approach is that it cannot take advantage of parallel execution of the kernels, since the gpu only allows one running cuda context at a time. this approach instead interleaves processes resulting in slightly improved resource-efciency; although it still suffers from poor utilization during each schedule quantum, explaining the linear-slowdown as the number of replicas grows. poor latency scalability makes time multiplexing alone an inadequate solution for interactive inference query serving. spatial multiplexing does improve on poor utilization and achieves much better resource- efciency. however, we nd there is poor predictability and isolation in this setup. it seems the spatial multiplexing approach is extremely sensitive to the choice of the number of tenants. each tenant appears to have fairly consistent behaviour once the model runs. but, across multiple model tenants, there is up to a % latency gap between the fastest model on a gpu and the slowest straggler model as seen in figure furthermore, the unpredictability and discrepancy between latencies across different processes is exacerbated when an odd number of processes runs concurrently with mps enabled. a new hope? dynamic space-time scheduling from our evaluation of current approaches, we nd that neither time-only multiplexing nor space- only multiplexing can meet all three performance criteria: good resource efciency, isolation and predictability. gpu single-tenancy leads to poor utilization and high costs . figure and figure demonstrate inherent scalability limitations to common space-only and time-only multiplexing strategies. figure details unpredictable latency as tenants are added to a gpu. figure shows the only way to schedule hundreds of models on gpu is to use single process utilizing one cuda stream per thread; since we are micro-managing the inference by dispatching kernels to different streams, there is an opportunity for more ne-grained scheduling control over the streams to optimize latency and throughput. in light of these limitations, we propose a promising new approach we call dynamic space-time scheduling. the key idea is trade-off space and time multiplexing in order to efciently utilize the gpu while preserving isolation and predictability. we preserve predictability and isolation during virtualization by monitoring inference latencies per-kernel. this allows reallocating resources between tenants on-the-y. moreover, we notice that cuda stream scheduling anomalies typically only create a few stragglers, so we can simply evict degraded workers without signicantly impacting total system throughput. we are further investigating this approach in ongoing work. our approach also dramatically improves resource-efciency on the gpu we observe a overall geometric mean speedup in throughput compared to time-only multiplexing and a speedup compared to space-only multiplexing, as shown in figure space-time scheduling merges many concurrent small kernels from disjoint dnn graphs into a small set of larger super-kernels that together ll the gpu. the super-kernel avoids the scheduling penalty associated with current space-only multiplexing approaches. as interactive inference queries arrive stochastically, we cannot easily precompute super-kernels ahead-of-time. instead, the space-time scheduler must dynamically schedule kernels as they arrive. we are investigating the design of a more general dynamic scheduler, but we notice that overheads gradually decrease if we cache super-kernels as workloads stabilize over time. our goal is to optimize a batch of distinct models dynamically, in comparison to ahead-of-time dnn graph optimizers like tvm , tensor comprehensions , halide , glow and tensorrt . these optimizers excel at single-tenant

guevara et al. , which manually combines small kernels within a stream to increase gpu utilization, yielding up to a x speedup on a gaussian elimination algorithm. while the work in guevara et al. focuses on manually merging kernels at the cuda block level, our approach discusses a scalable procedure to batch large numbers of kernels that execute similar matrix multiplication routines together dynamically, as well as interleave cuda streams. while ours is a matrix-math targeted approach, we demonstrate that it has high scalability on multiple real-world neural network tasks . our approach extends these tools and is complementary to the existing ecosystem. benchmarking dynamic space-time kernel scheduling we evaluate the overall throughput provided by multiplexing matrix multiplication kernels by time- only, space-only, and a proposed space-time multiplexing strategy. specically, we examine the single precision oating-point general matrix multiply kernel . matrix multiplication is often used to implement the convolution operator in neural networks, in addition to fourier-domain, winograd-domain, and direct kernel implementations . figure demonstrates that spatial multiplexing via hyper-q/cuda stream usage can improve throughput as compared to timeslicing approaches to gpu sharing. however, the average throughput is still substantially lower than the single-precision throughput offered by the v . instead of maintaining separate kernel streams which the device can schedule at a ne granularity, we investigate a software-based scheduler that batches kernels across models. by batching kernels across many models into a single super-kernel, a single gpu invocation would have an opportunity to saturate all resources on the gpu for its timeslice. to model the performance of a space-time multiplexing software scheduler, we measure the through- put of a nominal approach collecting sgemm problems from several models of the same architecture into a single batched matrix multiplication super-kernel. these models are have different weights and inputs, as is likely in a multi-tenancy setting. the batched super-kernel is more efcient than many smaller kernel invocations, and also better spatially multiplexes the gpu. this also allows better predictability of latency as the dynamic kernel scheduler can selectively batch kernels and determine when to execute workloads based on per-model slos. figure demonstrates substantially better throughput scaling via batching than via time-only and spatial-only multiplexing approaches. fixing the problem size m = , n = , k = , the number of concurrently submitted sgemm problems is scaled. this problem size represents an imcol sgemm implementation of a representative intermediate convolution in the resnet- table : space-time scheduling throughput increases over next best approach. r sgemm kernel evaluations are queued on a nvidia v gpu. matrix-vector: rnn m=, n=, k= resnet- conv_ m=, n=, k= square matrix-matrix m=n=k= r = x x x r = x x x r x x x next best scheduler time-only space-only space-only architecture , with a image input to the network, convolutional kernel size , and input and output channels to the layer. similar oating-point throughput improvements are observed for other intermediate layers, as well as for dense matrix-vector multiplications found in rnns and square matrix-matrix multiplications . this matrix multiply super-kernel is implemented in the nvidia cublas operation cublassgemmbatched. it requires all sub-kernel problem dimensions be the same. however, the magma blas library implements a variable-sized batched sgemm that would allow for different kernels to be batched. for all compared approaches, data is preallocated on the device as in a real-world dnn inference setting.","The section presents preliminary results from benchmarking different multiplexing approaches on GPU models, including batched exclusive access, time multiplexing, and spatial multiplexing. Batched exclusive access shows ideal performance for single models but with high cost. Time multiplexing provides good isolation and predictability but suffers from degraded throughput. Spatial multiplexing improves resource efficiency but lacks predictability. A new approach called dynamic space-time scheduling is proposed to trade off space and time multiplexing, improving resource efficiency by reallocating resources between tenants dynamically. This approach shows a speedup compared to other multiplexing strategies and enhances throughput scaling. Throughput evaluations of matrix multiplication kernels demonstrate the benefits of space-time multiplexing over time-only and space-only approaches, with better scalability and predictability in a multi-tenancy setting."

"in this work, we evaluated spatial and temporal multiplexing techniques to support inference across multiple models on a single gpu. we rst considered standard approaches utilized by popular dnn frameworks and gpu vendors like nvidia. while these techniques improve utilization, they increase latency and variability in prediction performance in benchmarks. neither space-only nor time-only mutliplexing techniques could achieve high resource-efciency, predictable latencies and isolation. we observe a large performance gap between batch-level parallelism and space-only multiplexing, suggesting substantial opportunities to improve utilization. we propose a dynamic space-and-time scheduler that addresses all three aforementioned criteria. software-level fusion of kernel operators across multiple models and inputs presents a promising approach to online inference scheduling. as an early evaluation of this approach, we studied roof-line performance available via sgemm fusion of all queued problems, which offers throughputs that scale well with the number of gpu tenants or model replicas. we demonstrate a > x speedup compared to the prior state-of-the-art in online inference multitenancy. we believe this work points towards a new approach to efcient multi- tenant execution of deep neural networks through intelligent inter-model fused kernel scheduling. acknowledgements we

"the structure of graphs with some given forbidden subgraphs is well studied, and quickly gained several applications in graph theory and in theoretical computer science. for some of the known results in this eld see , and . arxiv:v dec in this paper, we study the structure of -free graphs. a graph is a claw if it is isomorphic to k,, and a bull if it can be obtained from a triangle by adding two pendant edges at two dierent vertices . claw bull figure : claw and bull denition . an expansion of a graph g with vertex set v = {v, . . . , vn} is any graph h obtained from g by substituting its vertices with disjoint cliques k, i = , . . . , n, (called the bags of the expansion) and adding the edges of the complete bipartite graphs with the partite sets v and v for each vivj e. notation. let x and y be disjoint subsets of the vertex set of a graph g. then we write x g y to mean that every vertex in x is adjacent to every vertex in y . we also denote by ng , if g is understood) the open neighborhood of x, dened by ng =  [ xx ng  \ x. furthermore, given a natural number n n we write := {, , . . . , n}. the main result in this paper is as follows: theorem . a connected graph g is -free graph if and only if it belongs to one of the following classes of graphs: the class of graphs which are expansions of paths of length at lesat four, the class of graphs which are expansions of cycles of length at least six, the class of connected graphs which are complements of triangle-free graphs. since the complement of a bull is still a bull, the complement of triangle free graphs are also -free. as a corollary of theorem , this two classes are almost the same. corollary . the class of triangle-free graphs is the union of the class of complete bipartite graphs and the class of complements of all graphs g where g is a connected -graph which is not an expansion of a path of length at least or an expansion of a cycle of length at least in the following three sections we consider three sub-classes of -free graphs based on the length of a longest cycle. finally we combining the result of these sections to show theorem . we will use standard denitions and notation for graphs as given in . notation. given a graph g, we dene as the length of a longest induced cycle in g. this research was inspired by the following result on the structure of -free graphs, obtained in a study of the game of cops and robbers: lemma . let u and u be two adjacent vertices in a -free graph g, and let u be the set of neighbor of u in g u then, the component h of u in g u is an expansion of a path whose bags;

and b. g is an expansion of a path. proof. let k = diam. according to lemma we have k let v, vk v such that dg = k, and let p = v, . . . , vk be a geodesic path between them. moreover, let u = ng \ {u}, set h = g u and dene nis as in lemma . moreover, let a = {, , } be an independent set of vertices where is are distinct. claim no vertex in u is adjacent to v or a vertex in any ni with < i k. moreover, a vertex of u adjacent to a vertex in some ni is adjacent to every vertex in every nj with j < i. proof of claim if the rst part does not hold, then one has dg < + k < k, a contradiction. as for the second part of the claim, consider a vertex u u which is adjacent to a vertex wi ni and for each j {, . . . , i } choose a vertex wj nj. then, by the denition of the njs, w, w, . . . , wi is an induced path. since uw = uv, uwi e, by proposition it follows that every uwj is an edge of g. this establishes the second part of the claim. claim claim ni = for i > k. proof of claim it suces to show that nk+ = . to this end, by the way of contradiction suppose nk+ = and choose a vertex wk+ nk+ let q be a geodesic path in g from wk+ to v considering the fact that dh = k + > k, we conclude that q must contain exactly one vertex, say u, from u. as such, we must also have uv e, i.e. uv must be the last edge of q. moreover, since v \ {u} v , every vertex in v \ {u} must be in some nj. suppose the vertex of q preceding u is in ni and call it wi. case i: i > k. set w = v and for each j \ {}) choose wj nj. note that as i k , the induced path w, w, . . . , wi contains v moreover, since uw = uv e and uwi e, we must have uwj e for each j {, . . . , i}; in particular, uv e. but the latter contradicts claim hence, this case does not happen. case ii: i k. q will be of the form wk+wk, . . . , wi, u, v where each wj is in nj. in particular the length of q, which is bounded above by the diameter k of g, is k + i. hence, i on the other hand, by claim , we must have i < (since u is not adjacent to v n). therefore, i = and, hence, uv, uv e, according to claim moreover, we have uw e, by claim , whereas vw, ww e and vv, vw, vw, vw e. thus, g will be a bull, a contradiction. claim claim v = (sk ni) u. proof of claim contrary to the claim, assume (sk ni) u v or, equivalently, w := n \ (sk nj) = . let r be the set of paths of the shortest length from a vertex in w to vk. note that every path in r has at least one vertex in common with u, for otherwise w would be in sk nj, a contradiction. choose r r such that |v u| is the minimum. furthermore, let w be the initial vertex of r and u the last vertex of r which is in u. observe that every vertex of r that follows u is in some nj with j and, according to claim , the immediate successor of r is in s nj. let the latter be wi ni. then, we must have r = u, wi, . . . , wk, vk if i < k ;

It introduces the concepts of claws and bulls in graphs, expansions of graphs, and neighborhoods in graphs. The main result states that a connected graph is -free if it belongs to certain classes of graphs: expansions of paths of length at least four, expansions of cycles of length at least six, and complements of triangle-free graphs. The text also presents corollaries related to triangle-free graphs and further explores sub-classes of -free graphs based on the length of a longest cycle.

"shrinking ricci solitons model the geometry of solutions to the ricci ow in the vicinity of a developing singularity. all known complete noncompact shrinking ricci solitons which are not locally reducible as a product are smoothly asymptotic to a cone at innity . in four dimensions, there is growing evidence to suggest that the asymptotically conical shrinkers are the only nontrivial complete noncompact examples. their classication is vital to the understanding of the long-term behavior of the equation and to potential future topological applications. in our previous work , we have shown that these cones essentially determine the shrinker: whenever two shrinkers are asymptotic to the same cone along some ends of each, they must be isometric near innity on those ends. this reduces the classication to that of their possible asymptotic cones. a reasonable rst step toward an understanding of what cones can occur is to identify the geometric features which an asymptotically conical shrinker and its asymptotic cone must share in common. the purpose of this note is to detail the application of the uniqueness theorem in to the relationship between the isometry group of cone and shrinker. a direct application of that theorem implies that any symmetry of the asymptotic cone must, at least, be reected in a symmetry of the shrinker on some neighborhood of innity. the precise statement is this: if a shrinker is asymptotic to a cone c along an end v , then, for any isometry of c \ {o}, there is an end w v and a dieomorphism f : w c \ {r r} such that f f is an isometry of . the argument in does not provide a completely eective bound on the size of the end w, however, and, by itself, does not preclude that f and w may depend on the isometry . in this paper, we demonstrate that a uniform choice of f and w can be made for which the above correspondence provides an isomorphism between the vertex-xing the rst author was supported in part by simons foundation grant # the second author was partially supported by the nsf grants dms- and dms-, an alfred p. sloan research fellowship, the funding from the wisconsin alumni research foundation, and a vilas early career investigator award. the second author was also supported by a von neumann fellowship by the institute for advanced study: this material is based upon work supported by the z urich insurance company membership and the nsf grant dms- brett kotschwar and lu wang isometries of the cone and the isometries of the restriction of the shrinker to w. when the shrinker is complete, and the end is large enough, topologically, we show that the stabilizer of the vertex of the cone embeds into the isometry group of the entire shrinker. this topological condition is satised, for example, by the end of any complete k ahler shrinking soliton. we will need to introduce some notation to state our main result. let c denote the cone over the smooth compact -dimensional manifold , with vertex o. for a , let c a = , and denote by g = dr +rg the conical metric on c = c \ {o}. finally, for > , let : c c denote the dilation map = . following , we will then say that a riemannian manifold is asymp- totic to c along the end v if, for some a > , there is a dieomorphism f : c a v such that f g g as in c loc(c , g). we will say that a soliton is asymptotic to c along v when is. here, by end, we mean an unbounded connected component of the complement of a compact set. by , , any complete shrinker which satises | rc | as x will be asymptotic to a cone on each of its ends in the above sense. in dimension four, the same is true only assuming the scalar curvature tends to zero at innity. the uniqueness of the asymptotic cone is discussed in . the rst nontrivial examples of complete asymptotically conical shrinkers were exhibited by feldman-ilmanen-knopf . their construction uses an ansatz of u-symmetry to produce complete k ahler shrinkers on the tautological line bun- dle of cp m for each m this construction was generalized by dancer-wang and yang to produce further complete k ahler asymptotically conical ex- amples on line bundles over products of k ahler-einstein metrics with positive scalar curvature. theorem . suppose the shrinking soliton is asymptotic to c along the end v . then there is a , an end w of with w v , and a dieomorphism f : w c a such that f f is an isomorphism from isom onto isom. here, the conclusion does not require that be either complete or connected at innity. however, when is complete, it is reasonable to ask whether the isometries on w extend to isometries on m. the answer is yes at least when the fundamental group of v surjects onto that of m. this is a straightforward variation on the classical continuation argument for local isometries on simply-connected real- analytic manifolds;

Noncompact shrinking Ricci solitons asymptotically approach cones at infinity, with evidence suggesting that asymptotically conical shrinkers are the only nontrivial examples in four dimensions. The classification of these cones is crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of the equation and potential topological applications. The paper explores the relationship between the isometry group of the cone and the shrinker, showing that symmetries of the cone are reflected in the shrinker. When the shrinker is complete and the end is large enough, the stabilizer of the cone's vertex embeds into the isometry group of the shrinker. The uniqueness of asymptotic cones is discussed, with examples of complete asymptotically conical shrinkers given in the context of Kähler geometry. Theorems describe the relationship between isometries of the cone and the shrinker, with implications for topological conditions and isometry groups. The main result states that the isometries of the cone embed into the isometries of the shrinker when the cone is Kähler. Further questions are raised regarding the structure of complete simply-connected shrinkers."

"we next wish to show that the end of an asymptotically conical shrinker and the cone to which it is dynamically asymptotic are real-analytic relative to a common real-analytic structure. this is particularly convenient to address from within the isometries of asymptotically conical shrinkers parabolic framework established in the previous section. this framework realizes both the end of the soliton (c r, g) and the end of the cone (c r, g) as time-slices of the same smooth ricci ow, and reduces the problem to a matter of sharpening the usual statement of instantaneous real-analyticity for that equation. most of this section concerns general smooth solutions to the ricci ow and is independent of the rest of the paper. we will temporarily use g to denote an arbitrary smooth solution to the ricci ow on m . it is a classical theorem of bando that, when m is compact, for each < t t , ) is real-analytic relative to the atlas of normal coordinates associated to g. his proof, based on berstein-type estimates on the covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor, carries over essentially verbatim to the case that ) is complete and supm | rm | < . the estimates in were later localized by the rst author in to show that for any smooth solution to the ricci ow, ) is real-analytic for each t > here we point out that these same estimates imply that the metrics g are in fact real-analytic relative to a xed atlas, viz., the real-analytic structure (i.e., max- imal real-analytic atlas) induced by the atlas of normal coordinates taken relative to any one of the g. note that the solutions need not be complete, an aspect important for our application below. for complete solutions of bounded curvature, a stronger space-time analyticity result is proven in . see also . theorem . suppose g is a smooth solution to the ricci ow on m . then there exists a unique real-analytic structure a relative to which ) is analytic for all t -normal coordinate charts for any t > in the next section, we will use the following application of the above theorem to the ricci ow associated to a shrinker on an asymptotically conical end. corollary . suppose (c r, g, f) is dynamically asymptotic to (c , g). then (c r, g) and (c r, g) are real-analytic relative to a common real-analytic structure. in particular, the cross-section of the asymptotic cone of a shrinker is real- analytic. proof of corollary . we apply the theorem to c s for s > r by the compactness of c s , the restriction to c s of the solution to associated to (c r, g, f) is dened for , that is, for t for some > this shows that g and g are real-analytic relative to a common real-analytic structure on c s for all s > r, and hence on c r since the conical radial distance function r satises the elliptic equation r = n, it is real-analytic on c r relative to this structure as well. using the implicit function theorem in the real-analytic category, it follows that g is real-analytic. corollary shows that there are many smooth compact manifolds which cannot arise as the cross-section of the asymptotic cone of a shrinker. by contrast, there are, as yet, no known restrictions on the asymptotic cones of asymptotically conical expanding solitons. the real-analyticity of solitons was rst proven in . proof of theorem . for the uniqueness of the structure a, note rst that, if and are any overlapping smooth charts in which the expression of brett kotschwar and lu wang some metric g is analytic, then the transition map | : , g) , g) is an isometry between real-analytic metrics on open subsets of rn and therefore real-analytic itself. thus the two charts must belong to the same real-analytic structure. at the same time, according to , the manifolds ) for t > are real-analytic relative to the unique real-analytic structure at which contains the atlas of g-normal coordinates. thus a, if it exists, must contain and, by maximality, coincide with at for each t > to prove the existence of a, we will show that the structures at coincide for t (, t ]. since (, t ] is connected, we need only show that at is locally constant in t. this is a consequence of the following claim. claim. let t of g in the chart is real-analytic in x. for any x u, there exists an > and a neighbor- hood v u of x such that, for each t (, t ] with |t t| < , the expression of g in the same chart satises sup v |g| clkk!

"we now resume our discussion of shrinking solitons and revert to our previous notational conventions. we will use (c r, g, f) to denote a shrinking soliton that is dynamically asymptotic to c, and g = g to denote the associated solution to on c r with g = g and g = g. as before, f = f will denote the evolving family of potentials on c r (, ]. we will break the proof of theorem into several smaller pieces. first we show that a local isometry : c r c r of any g will also preserve f, unless g is at . we already know this for = , since, by , any isometry of (c , g) will preserve f = r r. lemma . suppose that : c r c r is a local isometry of g = g for some = f or g is at. proof. write h = f f. then g and f together satisfy on c r, and subtracting the two instances of equation yields

isometry of g on c a , it is real-analytic relative to a, too. but then h = g g is also real-analytic on c a . since h on c b , we must have h on c a as well. for the proof of the reverse inclusion in theorem , we will need to know that an isometry of g for some (, ] must also preserve g = g. since (c r, g) is incomplete, we cannot appeal directly to the backward uniqueness theorem in . however, the situation here is more elementary to begin with. since g is self-similar for (, ], and, by lemma , we may assume that the isometry preserves gf, the problem reduces to that of the uniqueness of

"a classical theorem of myers states that, if , are complete, connected, simply connected real-analytic manifolds and : u v is an isometry between connected open sets u m and v n, then extends to an isometry : m n. here we show that the hypothesis of simple-connectivity can be exchanged for the assumption that the fundamental group of u surjects onto that of m. as we have seen, this technical improvement has has some useful applications to the extension of isometries on complete asymptotically k ahler shrinkers and its proof requires just a few modications to the original argument, the ingredients for the proof are classical, see, e.g., , , ; as we are not aware of an appropriate reference, we provide a proof here for completeness. first, we recall some denitions from . two isometries i : ui vi, i = , are said to be immediate continuations if u u = and = on u u given an isometry : u v and a continuous curve : m with u, a continuation of along is dened to be a collection {t}t of isometries t : ut vt between open subsets ut m, vt n satisfying that = and that t and t are immediate continuations whenever |tt| is suciently small. the following statement is contained in propositions - of . proposition . let and be complete, real-analytic riemannian manifolds and : u v an isometry between connected open sets u m, v n. then, brett kotschwar and lu wang admits a continuation {t}t along any continuous : m with u. if : m is continuous and path-homotopic to and {t}t is a continuation of along , then = on a neighborhood of = . the following theorem gives a sucient condition for a local isometry on u to extend a local isometry on m. if it exists, it can be recovered by continuation along paths from some x u; the only issue to check is that this is well-dened. the gist of the proof is this: provided surjects onto , any two paths between points x and x m will be homotopic to paths which may initially dier inside u but which meet at some point in u and coincide thereafter. the above proposition guarantees that the continuations along the latter paths agree. theorem . suppose and are complete connected real-analytic riemannian manifolds and : u v is an isometry between connected open sets u m and v n. if, for some x u, the homomorphism : induced by inclusion : u m is surjective, then can be extended to a surjective local isometry : m n. if, in addition, ) surjects onto ) (e.g., if m and n are dieomorphic) then extends to an isometry : . proof. let x m and , : i m be any continuous paths with i = x and i = x. here i = . by proposition , admits continuations { t}ti and { t}ti along and we claim that = in a neighborhood of x. by assumption, is path-homotopic to a continuous loop : i m based at x with u. fix some homotopy h : i i m with h = and h = ( ) for all t i, and h = h = x for all s i, and consider the paths , : i m dened by =  = h t h t , =  = h t h t . now let { t }ti and { t }ti be any continuations of along and note rst that / and / must coincide with in a neighborhood of = = . indeed, since u and u, we can form continuations of along these portions of and simply by restricting to suciently small neighborhoods of the points of the paths. by uniqueness, these continuations must agree locally with the continuations t and t for t / as claimed. but, since the paths and agree for t , the collections { t |u t u t }t and { t |u t u t }t are both continuations of the common isometry / = / = along the path |. so and agree on a neighborhood of x. on the other hand, and are path-homotopic to and , respectively, by their construction. so, by proposition , and must agree with and and, hence, with each other, near x. we now dene : m n at x m by = , where {t}ti is a continuation of along any continuous path : i m connecting x to x. the isometries of asymptotically conical shrinkers discussion above shows that is well-dened on m. since it agrees with a local isometry in a neigborhood of each point, it is smooth and satises h = g. since is a local isometry, it is an open map, and since and are complete, is also closed. since n is connected, is therefore surjective. for the last claim, assuming that ) ) is also surjective, we may apply the above argument to obtain an extensions of both and to surjective local isometries : and : . since and agree with the identity maps on u and v and are themselves local isometries, they must agree with the identity map on all of m and n. so is injective, and hence an isometry of onto . theorem is then an easy consequence of the above theorem. proof of theorem . suppose that the homomorphism in- duced by inclusion v m is surjective. by theorem , there is r > and an end w v dieomorphic to c r such that isom = isom. now, v is dieomorphic to c r, and the inclusion of w v induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups, so surjects onto for some x w. then implies that any isometry isom can be extended to an element isom. this extension is unique, so the correspondence it denes is in- jective, and it is a homomorphism since if and are the extensions of and , respectively, then the extension of will agree with on w and hence on all of m.","Myers' theorem states that an isometry between connected open sets on complete, connected, and simply connected real-analytic manifolds extends to an isometry on the entire manifolds. The section discusses how the simple-connectivity assumption can be replaced with the surjection of fundamental groups to extend isometries. The proof involves minor modifications to the original argument, and the theorem has applications to complete asymptotically Kähler shrinkers. Key concepts include immediate continuations of isometries, path-homotopy, and extending local isometries. The section provides a detailed proof for completeness, showcasing the technical aspects of extending isometries on manifolds."

"this work is concerned with the propagation speeds of solutions in the attraction keller-segel chemotaxis models of the form ( ut = u + u, x rn = v v + u, x rn, where a, b, , and > are positive constants, and u and v represent the densities of the mobile species and the chemo-attractant, respectively. biologically, the positive constant measures the sensitivity eect on the mobile species by the chemical substance which is produced overtime by the mobile species; the reaction u in the rst equation of describes the local dynamics of the mobile species; represents the degradation rate of the chemo-attractant; and is the rate at which the mobile species produces the chemo-attractant. system is a simplied version of the chemotaxis system proposed by keller and segel in their works . chemotaxis models describe the oriented movements of biological cells and organisms in response to chemical gradient which they may produce themselves over time. these mathematical models play very important roles in a wide range of biological phenomena and accordingly a considerable literature is concerned with its mathematical analysis. the reader is referred to for some detailed introduction into the mathematics of keller-segel models. a famous application of chemotaxis models is to describe the life cycle of dictyostelium dis- coideum. as described in , d. discoideum lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria and other microorganisms that are taken up by phagocytosis. during the vegetative growth stage, the single-celled amoebae divide by simple mitotic divisions. in times of starvation, a developmental program is initiated, which is accompanied by major changes in gene expression. as a result, cells begin to signal each other by secreting camp and to aggregate by chemotaxis toward this chemoattractant. the resulting multicellular aggregate contains up to a few hundred thousand cells and undergoes further dierentiation and morphogenetic changes. finally a fruiting body is formed which consists of two main cell types, spore and stalk cells. the stalk consists of dead vacuolated cells, while the spore cells are resistant to extreme temperatures or drought. more favorable environmental conditions enable the hatching of new amoebae from the spores. the aggregation of thousands of individual cells that build a multicellular organism in this peculiar life cycle, has intrigued scientists for decades. the study of the dynamics of solutions to has attracted a number of researchers over the past few years. finite time blow-up phenomena is among important dynamical issues about . this phenomena has been studied in many papers in the case a = b = (see [, ?, , , , , , ]). it is shown that nite time blow-up may occur if either n = and the total initial population mass is large enough, or n it is also shown that some radial solutions to in plane collapse into a persistent dirac-type singularity in the sense that a globally dened measure-valued solution exists which has a singular part beyond some nite time and asymptotically approaches a dirac measure . we refer the reader to and the references therein for more insights in the studies of chemotaxis models. when the constant a and b are positive, the nite time blow-up phenomena in may be suppressed to some extent. in fact in this case, it is known that when the space dimension is equal to one or two, solutions to with initial functions in a space of certain integrable functions are dened for all time. and it is enough for the self limitation coecient b to be big enough comparing to the chemotaxis sensitivity coecient to prevent nite time blow-up, see . spatial spreading dynamics is another important dynamical issue about . observe that, when = , the chemotaxis system reduces to ut = u + u, x rn. due to the pioneering works of fisher and kolmogorov, petrowsky, piskunov on traveling wave solutions and take-over properties of , is also referred to

the front propagation dynamics of reaction diusion equations of the form, ut = u + uf, x rn, where f < for u , uf < for u (see [, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ], etc.). recently, the rst two authors of the current paper studied the spatial spreading dynamics of and obtained several fundamental results. some lower and upper bounds for the propagation speeds of solutions with compactly supported initial functions were derived, and some lower bound for the speeds of traveling wave solutions was also derived. it is proved that all these bounds converge to the spreading speed c = a of as . the reader is also referred to for the lower and upper bounds of propagation speeds of , and is referred to , etc., for the studies on traveling wave solutions of various types of chemotaxis models. however, several important biological and mathematical problems remain open. for example, whether the presence of the chemical substance in slows down or speeds up the propagation of mobile species,

"in this subsection, we give some discussions on our main results. chemotaxis models describe the oriented movements of biological cells and organisms in re- sponse to chemical gradient. consider and its counterpart on a bounded domain rn, ut = u + u, x = v v + u, x u n = v n = , x . suppose that u is the population density of certain biological cells and v is the density of some chemical substance. then, in ), the term u describes the movement of the biological cells following random walk, which suggests that the cells move randomly from the places with higher cell density to the places with lower cell density; the term reects the movement of the biological cells subject to the chemical substance, which suggests that the cells move from the places with lower chemical substance density to the places with higher chemical substance density when > ; the logistic term u governs the local dynamics of the cell population; and the second equation in ) indicates that the chemical substance diuses via random walk very quickly and is produced over time by the biological cells. both mathematically and biologically, it is important to investigate what dynamical scenarios may be produced by the interaction of these factors in ), or how the chemotaxis aects the dynamics in ). observe that, in the absence of chemotaxis , the dynamics of is governed by , and the dynamics of is governed by ( ut = u + u, x u n = , x . it is known that the asymptotic dynamics of is completely determined by the logistic term u. more precisely, it is known that u a b is the unique steady-state solution of (a b is referred to as the carrying capacity of the system), and for any given positive initial distribution u c( ) and u ), the solution u of with u = u converges to a b (i.e., the limiting distribution is a b). the dynamics of is recalled in the above. among others, it is known that if initially the population is inhabited in a bounded region, it spreads into the whole space at the speed c = a. moreover, c = a is the minimal wave speed of traveling wave solutions of connecting a b and many authors have been studying possible dynamical scenarios induced from the chemotaxis in various chemotaxis models through the study of such models in bounded domains. very rich dynamics has been observed. for example, when a = b = , nite time blow-up may occur in if either n = and the total initial population mass is large enough, or n (see , and the references therein). when a and b are positive constants and = = , if either n or b > n n , then for any positive initial data u c( ), possesses a unique bounded global classical solution , v) with u = u, and hence the nite time blow-up phenomena in is suppressed to some extent. moreover, if b > , then (a b , a b ) is the unique positive steady-state solution of , and for any positive initial distribution u c( ) ), lim t  u a b l + v a b l  = . but if b < , there may be more than one positive steady-state solutions of . in the current paper, we investigate the dynamics of chemotaxis models through the study of such models in unbounded domains, in particular, through the study of chemotaxis models in the whole space from the angle of spreading speed. the rst two authors of this paper have done a series of works in this direction and obtained several fundamental results. for example, as it is mentioned before, in the papers by , we studied the dynamics of from the angle of spreading speed, and observed that if the population is initially inhabited in a bounded region, it spreads into the whole space as time evolves. moreover, some explicit lower bound c low and upper bound c up of the spreading speeds are obtained, and it is proved that both the lower and upper bounds converge to the spreading speed c = a of as but it left as an open question whether or when the solution of with compactly supported initial function spreads at the speed c = a. the above open question is studied in the current paper and some satisfactory answers are obtained. for example, assume b > (i.e. the logistic damping constant b is larger than the product of the chemotaxis sensitivity and the production rate of the chemical substance produced by the biological cells). it is proved in this paper that the spreading speed c = a of is always a lower bound of the spreading speeds of solutions of with compactly supported or half space supported initial distributions and theorem ), which implies that the chemotaxis does not slow down the spreading of population with compactly supported or half space supported initial distributions. if, in addition, a (i.e. the degradation rate of the chemo-attractant is larger than or equal to the intrinsic growth rate a of the biological cells), it is proved that the spreading speed c = a of is also an upper bound of the spreading speeds of solutions of with compactly supported or half space supported initial distributions and theorem ). hence if b > and a, then the chemotaxis neither slows down nor speeds up the spreading of the cell population. in general, we conjecture that the presence of the chemo-attractant does not increase the maximal spreading speed. while our results do not settle completely the question of the exact spreading speeds of solutions to , they provide a satisfactory answer for some range of the parameters. it would be of great mathematical interest to know whether the presence of the chemical really aects the spreading speed in general. we plan to devote some of our future works to address this question. in the paper by , we studied traveling wave solutions of connecting (a b , a b) and , and found a constant c(> c = a) satisfying that, for any c > c, has a traveling wave solution with speed c connecting the constant solutions (a b, a b ) and . moreover, it is proved that c c = a as it left as an open question whether has a minimal wave speed cmin and if so, whether cmin = c this open question is also studied in the current paper and some satisfactory answers are obtained. for example, it is proved in this paper that, if b > and a, then c = a is the minimal wave speed of traveling wave solutions of connecting (a b , a b ) and . but when one of the conditions b > and a fails, the question of the existence of the minimum wave speed of connecting the two constant equilibria remains an open problem. it should be pointed out that the techniques developed in this work easily extend to the repulsion-chemotaxis models, that is < hence analogous results can be obtained in such setting. the rest of the paper is organized as follows. in section , we present some preliminary results to be used in the proofs of our main results. in section , we study the spreading speed of solutions and prove theorems . finally

"in this section we derive an explicit upper bound on the spreading speeds of solutions of with nonempty compactly supported initial functions or exponentially decay initial functions, and prove theorems and . proof of theorem . first, note that for any c > c, there is < < a such that ( )+ ( + ) and c > c = + a . then by lemma , we have lim tsup |x|ct u = this implies that c + c. note that

comparison principle for parabolic equations that u < , t , x r. furthermore, since a for every t , then by it holds that p a rm sup t a p a rm > c. it then follows from that lim inf t inf |x|ctu > step in this step we compare u and u and show that u < u, |x| t + m, t suppose, by contradiction that does not hold. then there is tinf [, ) satisfying tinf := inf{t | xt r, satisfying u u, |xt| t +

|xinf| < tinf + m in this case, by inequalities , , and , there is < such that { : |y| < t + m} and a = vx, tinf t tinf, xinf x xinf + . note that u < u x and u u tinf t tinf. thus, by the comparison principle for parabolic equations, we have u < u tinf t tinf, xinf x xinf + . in particular, u < u. which contradicts to . case |xinf| = tinf + m in this case, without loss of generality, we may suppose that xinf = tinf + m let < < n be xed. observe that for every t [tinf , tinf) and x [xinf , ) |x| ct xinf ctinf = ntinf + m > m thus, by , , and we obtain that a = vx, tinf t tinf, x xinf . whence, since u u, tinf c + n t tinf, in order to conclude that u < u and obtain a contradiction as in the previous case, it is enough to show that u(tinf c + n , x) < u(tinf c + n , x), x xinf . so,

it converges (up to a subsequence) locally uniformly to some function u cb unif. furthermore, since xn as n , it follows that infxr u infx u > m. note also that um. thus, by theorem , we have that

"the lithium abundance -a- in globular clusters re- mains an unsolved and fascinating riddle. these stellar systems are known to have multiple populations , characterised by signicant star-to-star variations in the abundances of elements involved in proton-capture reactions, i.e. he, c, n, o, na, mg, al, often structured in coherent patterns. among these patterns, the most evident is the na-o anticorrelation, observed in all the old gcs , with the only exceptions so far of ruprechet and e . according to their na and o abun- dances, gc stars are roughly classied in rst and second populations, indicating stars without or with chemical sig- natures from proton-capture reactions, respectively. these reac- tions occur at temperatures exceeding k, in stellar layers having no li, because it is expected to be totally destroyed at temperatures of a few times k. for this reason, p stars should be li-free or exhibit a signicant depletion of a with respect to p stars. surprisingly, no relevant dierence in a is found in p and p stars, with some gcs show- ing only hints of a li-na anticorrelation or a larger scatter in a in p stars with respect to p stars (pasquini et al. ; lind et al. ; gonzlez hernndez et al. ; monaco et al. ; dobrovolskas et al. ) and other gcs with a re- send oprint requests to: a. mucciarelli based on observations collected at the eso-vlt under programs d- a=log nli nh + markably similar li content among the stars (bonifacio ; dorazi et al. , a). theoretical models proposed to ex- plain the formation of mps suggest dierent polluters in order to produce the observed na-o anticorrelation, the most popu- lar ones being fast-rotating massive and asymptotic giant branch stars . the former are not able to produce fresh li, while the latter (espe- cially the most massive ones, the so-called super-agb stars) can produce new li through the cameron-fowler mechanism . in this framework, the stellar system omega centauri is a special case, showing a large spread (at variance with gcs that are homogeneous in their fe con- tent, see e.g. willman & strader ) but also an extended na- o anticorrelation (johnson & pilachowski ; marino et al. ). also, omega centauri exhibits a clear and well-dened li-na anticorrelation . in this letter we report the discovery of two giant stars in omega centauri showing a signicant enhancement of a with re- spect to other stars of the system. one of these stars is also sig- nicantly enriched in na.","The text discusses the unsolved mystery of lithium abundance in globular clusters, which are known to have multiple populations with varying abundances of certain elements. One prominent pattern is the sodium-oxygen anticorrelation seen in old globular clusters. Despite expectations that stars without proton-capture reactions should be lithium-free, some clusters show no significant difference in lithium content between stars with and without such reactions. Theoretical models propose different sources for the observed abundance patterns, such as fast-rotating massive stars and asymptotic giant branch stars. Omega Centauri stands out for its spread in iron content and extended sodium-oxygen anticorrelation. The discovery of two giant stars in Omega Centauri with significantly enhanced lithium content and one also enriched in sodium is reported."

proofs: manuscript no. mucciarelli_lirich table main information about the two li-rich stars in omega centauri id ra dec rv te log g vt anlte nlte +. . +. +. +. . +. +. the origin of li-rich stars remains still debated and can be ascribed to dierent processes, including external or inter- nal li production. one of the most invoked external mechanism to increase a is the engulfment of small bodies, like plan- ets or brown dwarfs that should enhance both li and be. this scenario seems to be unlikely for the li- rich stars in omega centauri because of the low occurrence of metal-poor stars hosting planets ; usually the planet engulfment is considered the main mecha- nism to explain li-rich giants with metallicity higher than dex . also, the engulfment of a planet should also increase the rotational velocity and the chromospheric activity of the star . we checked that the measured full widths at half maximum are compatible with the nominal spectra resolutions and we estimate that in these stars the projected rotational velocity is virtually compatible with no stellar rotation. on the other hand, the na d lines do not show evidence of circumstellar material. another proposed mechanism to explain li-rich stars but in- voking an internal production of fresh li is the cameron-fowler mechanism . in this case we can en- visage two possibilities. the rst option is extra mixing ecient within the star during its rgb evolution. this mixing needs to circulate matter between the base of the convective envelope and a region close to the h-burning shell. both speed and depth of the circulation must be such that he from the convec- tive envelope is transported to temperatures high enough to activate the hebe reaction, with be quickly transported back to cooler regions, where li can be then produced by the beli reaction. several papers (see, e.g. da silva, de la reza & barbuy ; sackmann & boothroyd ; charbonnel & balachandran ; denissenkov & vandenberg ; denissenkov & herwig ; guandalini et al. ; palmerini et al. , and refer- ences therein) have discussed in detail scenarios/mechanisms to achieve this. denissenkov & vandenberg , in particular, have shown that by calibrating the extra mixing parameters, enhanced li abundances in the envelope can be produced, together with increased na . this could for example go towards explaining the exceptionally high measured in # the extra mixing is usually associated to ro- tation, and the common assumption is that it is activated after the rgb bump, because the molecular weight barrier between base of the convective envelope and h-burning shell existing be- fore this event, is expected to inhibit element transport between envelope and shell. indeed, chanam, pinsonneault & terndrup have shown with full stellar evolution calculations in- cluding rotation and rotational mixings, that this barrier pre- vents rotational mixing to be ecient between convective en- velope and h-burning shell . our two li-rich objects are located below the rgb bump, as shown in figs. a. and a. the second option is production of fresh li this time in agb stars , and mass transfer from a massive star that evolved through the agb phase and transferred li-rich material onto our targets. from a theoretical point of view, the super-agb stars, with masses of - m, may be able to produce simultane- ously a large amount of li and na (ventura & dantona ; dantona et al. ; doherty et al. ). in these stars, li is produced through the cameron-fowler mechanism, while na is produced through the ne-na cycle. we remind that super-agb stars could play a relevant role in the explanation of the mps observed in all gcs and in omega centauri, because they are among the candidate polluter stars able to generate the p stars. in this framework, two possible scenarios can be envisaged for # : the star formed directly from the gas ejected from super- agb stars before dilution with pristine gas. theoretical mod- els of mps based on agb stars as main polluters need to in- clude some dilution of the agb ejecta with pristine gas in order to reproduce the observed chemical patterns. this is due to the mass dependence of the agb yields that should lead to a na-o correlation, at variance with what has been observed, if no di- lution process is accounted for. however, it has been proposed that a small fraction of stars may have formed from the pure ejecta of super-agb stars before the dilution process, preserv- ing the original chemical composition of these polluting stars . this mechanism could explain the pres- ence of a he-rich sub-population in some systems (like omega centauri and ngc , norris ; piotto et al. ; sollima et al. ), because the super-agb stars should also produce a large amount of he. hence, in this scenario we expect that # should have a high he content . the star was member of a binary system together with a mas- sive star and accreted li-rich material from the companion when the latter reaches the super-agb phase. in this case, the abun- dances that we measure are not its original ones but they re- ect the chemical composition of the interior of the compan- ion, plus some degree of dilution with the convective envelope of the accreting star. the radial velocities measured from individual flames spectra do not show evidence of variability. however, they have been taken on a period of about weeks and we can- not exclude that the star is member of a binary system of a longer period. hence, with the current dataset we are not able to disen- tangle between the two scenarios. even if the precise amount of li and na produced by agb stars of dierent masses is highly sensitive to several physical assumptions (i.e. the treatment of the convection, overshooting and mass loss), the measured li and na abundances of # are qualitatively compatible with those foreseen for the super- agb stars . this li-na-rich star may be a direct evidence of extra- mixing occurring before the rgb bump, or the rst observed relic of the gas ejected from super-agb stars, demonstrating that these stars can play a role to explain the mps in omega cen- tauri. in both cases, a future inventory of the chemistry of this article number, page of a. mucciarelli et al.: li-rich stars in omega centauri fig. behaviour of a as a function of log g for the stars in omega centauri , in the two li-rich stars discussed here , in the li-rich stars discovered so far in gcs (green circles, squared symbols are the stars for which has been measured) and the gc ngc . star, in particular the elements involved in the proton-capture reactions , is crucial to understand the origin of this unique object. for in- stance, the measure of the c/c isotopic ratio will conrm or refute the pre-bump nature of this star. if this will be conrmed, the denissenkov & vandenberg model may be discarded leaving the agb scenario only. if the chemical composition of # will conrm the scenario related to super-agb stars, this star will allow to directly study the chemical composition of the gas processed in the interior of the super-agb stars. acknowledgements. we thank the anonymous referee for his/her useful

It highlights that optimization solutions often involve matrices with fields of values as disks centered at the origin. The study illustrates this phenomenon using examples and investigates matrices where the set of disk matrices forms a manifold with partially smooth numerical radius properties. Specific cases such as matrices with a single superdiagonal, including Jordan blocks and the Crabb matrix, are examined. Additionally, complex three-by-three matrices are considered, revealing intricate details. Notably, the set of disk matrices is identified as a semi-algebraic manifold in a real vector space of dimension 3."

This quantity, denoted by r, is defined as the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of a matrix, and its properties have been extensively studied in mathematical research. The numerical radius is related to stability, convergence behavior, and optimization problems involving matrices. Recent work has focused on disk matrices, which are matrices whose fields of values are disks centered at zero in the complex plane. These matrices are of interest due to their optimality in various applications. The paper presents examples and results on disk matrices, including their parametrization and variational properties. An exploration of the numerical radius at disk matrices and its subgradients is discussed, along with results on partial smoothness. The study also investigates the three-by-three case in detail, providing insights into the behavior of the numerical radius in this setting."
"for now, we focus on two examples to illustrate our theme. more examples, arising from the proximal operator for the numerical radius, follow in section feedback control our rst example generalizes our original dynamical system xk+ = axk in the space cn by involving an input vector uk cm and an output vector yk cp, related as follows: xk+ = axk + buk, yk = cxk, for given matrices b and c. if we set uk = kyk for some matrix k , we arrive at the system xk+ = mxk , dened by the matrix m = a + bkc. the classical static output feedback problem is to choose k so that m is stable. the problem of determining whether such a matrix k exists in general seems to be hard; indeed, when bounds are put on all the entries of k, this problem is np-hard . however, as long as mp n , the problem is generically solvable via pole placement: k can be chosen to place the eigenvalues of m in any desired location . on the other hand, as we remarked earlier, although stability by itself does not give information about the transient behavior of the system, such information is given by the numerical radius r  m  . by contrast with the question of stabil- ity, the problem of minimizing the function r  m  is tractable via semidenite programming, thanks to theorem , observing that the map m is ane. we now report on some computational experiments minimizing r  m  which clearly support our claim that minimizing the numerical radius frequently leads to disk matrices. normally a, b and c depend on the application of interest, but here we generated them randomly, choosing them to be real matrices with i.i.d. entries from the normal distribution. we set n = and considered m and p varying from to n. for each choice of , we generated random triples with dimensions nn, nm and pn respectively. we then used the cvx package to minimize the numerical radius r  m  over m-by-p matrices k for each randomly generated triple, resulting in an optimal controller k. we then used the chebfun package , as described in , to compute the boundary of the eld of values of the optimal matrix m = m( k) and measure how close it is to being a circle centered at the origin. to do this we recomputed the numerical radius r( m) = max  |z| : z bd  w( m)  as well as the inner numerical radius r( m) = min  |z| : z bd  w( m)  , and computed a measure r( m) r( m) of the distortion of w( m) from a disk cen- tered at zero. table shows, for each triple, in how many of the instances the resulting value r( m) r( m) was below a threshold that we set to these quantities are shown as percentages rounded to the nearest % because repeated runs indicated that with this choice of rounding, the results are reasonably consis- tent. for the cases where % is displayed, actually not even one out of the runs resulted in a matrix satisfying the criterion r( m) r( m) < , while for p = p = p = p = p = m = % % % % % m = % % % % % m = % % % % % m = % % % % % m = % % % % % table : percentage of cases where w(m( k)) is a disk the case m = p = all optimal matrices satised the given criterion; this is simply because in this case, with free variables, the optimal matrix is zero with probability one. more interesting is the fact that these computational results are consistent with our theoretical results given later in the paper. in the cases we study, we show that the set of disk matrices in the euclidean space mn of complex n n matrices typically has codimension n. (we do not pursue the real case here, but in the space of n n real matrices, the analogous codimension is n.) in the cases in the table where none of the optimal matrices satised the disk matrix criterion, the number of free variables in the optimization problem, mp, is less than n, and therefore the probability of the ane space of feasible matrices intersecting the manifold of disk matrices is zero. in contrast, in all cases when n mp < n, one can expect the ane space of feasible matrices to intersect the manifold of disk matrices, so that there is at least the possibility that the optimal matrix is a disk matrix and evidently, from the results in the table, the probability of this happening is nonzero, ranging in fact from approximately % to %. the crouzeix ratio our second example arises from observations that minimizing a certain ratio associated with the crouzeix conjecture seems to result in disk matrices. in particular, a special case that is known to be true is that, for matrices x mn, the ratio  r n xn is minimized by a bidiagonal matrix whose eld of values is a disk. we discuss this matrix, which we call the crabb matrix, in section note that setting k = n in implies that the ratio given above is bounded below by ; this value is attained by the crabb matrix.","The text discusses examples of numerical radius optimization in the context of feedback control systems. The first example involves determining a stable matrix K to minimize the numerical radius of the matrix M, which is tractable via semidefinite programming. Computational experiments showed that minimizing the numerical radius often leads to disk matrices. The second example involves minimizing a ratio associated with the Crouzeix conjecture, which also results in disk matrices. The text highlights that certain matrices, such as the Crabb matrix, yield a disk shape when optimizing the ratio."
"we begin with some basic convex analysis on euclidean spaces nite-dimensional real inner-product spaces. we consider several specic euclidean spaces. for in- tegers n , we consider the space cn of complex column n-vectors with inner product x, y= re, the space of n-by-n complex matrices mn with the inner product x, y = re trace, and the subspace hn of hermitian matrices (with the same inner product). unless otherwise stated, always refers to the norm induced by the inner product. dimension always refers to the real vector space notion. a set of vectors {xk : k k} is anely independent in a euclidean space e if and only if the vectors { : k k} are linearly independent in the product space e r. the notation ri denotes relative interior. given a euclidean space e, and a norm on e, a vector y e is, by denition, a subgradient of at a point x e when y, w x for all w e. we write the set of subgradients as . given a nonempty convex set c e, the subspace parallel to c is dened by par c = r. by contrast, the linear span of c is span c = rc rc par c. the two subspaces are identical if and only if c. proposition consider any norm on a euclidean space e. at any point x e, we have the following relationships: =  y : y, x= par    = xspan    . proof the rst equation follows from a standard argument, as follows. by the denition of subgradients, we have y if and only if y, w for all w e. if such a subgradient y also satises y, x= , then subtracting implies inequal- ity . conversely, inequality implies y, x= , by setting w equal to x and in turn, and then adding implies inequality . turning to the second equation, any element of the left-hand side can be written in the form u = for a scalar r and subgradients y, z . clearly u lies in span    , and the rst equation guarantees u, x= , so u also lies in the right-hand side. for the converse, since , there is nothing to prove when x = , so we can assume x = , and hence = any element of the right-hand side can be written in the form u = yz for a scalars , r and subgradients y, z , where y z, x= using the rst equation, we deduce = so = , and the result follows. following , we call a norm (or, more generally, an extended-valued convex function) on e partly smooth at a point x e relative to a set m e contain- ing x if m is in fact a c-smooth manifold around x whose normal space satis- es nm = par    , and such that the restriction of to m is c-smooth and the subdierential mapping restricted to m is continuous. in particular, any norm is partly smooth at zero relative to {}. this denition captures the smooth/nonsmooth geometry of the norm around the point x. specically, the convex function y restricted to the tangent space tm is dierentiable at zero, but is sharp in nonzero directions y tm: the sum of the directional derivatives in the directions y and y is strictly positive. for example, for any point x rn, dened the index set j = {i : xj = }. then the l-norm is partly smooth at x relative to the manifold  z rn : zj = for all j j . then the l-norm is partly smooth at any point in m relative to m. when a norm is partly smooth relative to a set, we can view that set locally as the set of solutions of a parametrized family of optimization problems. to illustrate, consider the proximal operator corresponding to a proper closed convex function on e, namely the map prox : e e dened by prox = argmin xe  + x u . proximal operators are central to many rst-order algorithms for convex optimiza- tion. they are often tractable to compute: in particular, if the function is semidef- inite representable, as is the case for the numerical radius , then we can compute the corresponding proximal operator by semidenite programming. among several useful consequences of the idea of partial smoothness, particularly intuitive is its use in sensitivity analysis, by which we mean the behavior of solutions to optimization problems under small perturbations to the data. under reasonable conditions, the manifold in the denition consists, locally, of all possible optimal solutions to perturbed problems. as a typical example, we consider the prox operator associated with a convex function . note that y is a subgradient of at a point x if and only if prox maps x + y to x. partial smoothness reveals what happens under perturbations. theorem suppose a proper closed convex function on a euclidean space e is partly smooth at a point x e relative to a set m e. consider any subgradient y ri    . then the proximal operator prox maps x + y to x, and maps x + n, where n is any small neighborhood of y, onto a neighborhood of x in m. in particular, with the assumptions of this theorem, with positive probability, the proximal operator prox maps vectors chosen randomly from a probability distri- bution with support e into the set m. thus optimization problems (and proximal operators) commonly produce solutions in the manifold m, even though its di- mension may be low. the results we prove below about partial smoothness of the numerical radius relative to the set of disk matrices suggest that analogous behavior may be at play in the numerical examples we presented in section","The text discusses subgradients, normed spaces in convex analysis, and partial smoothness in Euclidean spaces. Key points include defining subgradients, the relationship between subgradients and parallel subspaces, and the concept of partial smoothness relative to a set. It also touches on the application of partial smoothness in sensitivity analysis and optimization problems. The text concludes with a theorem stating that under certain conditions, the proximal operator maps perturbed solutions to a neighborhood within the set where the function is partly smooth. This implies that optimization solutions often lie within the smooth region of the function's domain, even with small perturbations."
"in this work, we prove partial smoothness of the numerical radius around some interesting matrices. before proceeding to our general development, we illustrate our results on some simple special cases. here and throughout the paper, we denote the unit circle in the complex plane by t. the two-by-two case in m, disk matrices coincide with nilpotent matrices, as follows immediately from . in particular, consider the jordan block j =   scaled so that its eld of values is the unit disk. as shown in , at j, the numerical radius r has subdierential r = conv n  w w w  : w t o , and furthermore, integrating over w t shows j ri  r  . as we show later, r is partly smooth at j relative to the set of disk matrices a, or equivalently in the case n = , the set of nilpotent matrices. hence, by theorem , the proximal operator for the numerical radius, proxr, maps all matrices near j to nilpotent matrices near j. computational tests, using semidenite programming, conrm this property. the three-by-three case the analogous behavior in m is also simple to check. now we consider the jordan block j = , again scaled so that its eld of values is the unit disk. following the same argument as in , it is easy to see that at j, the numerical radius r has subdierential r = conv n w w w w w w w : w t o . integrating again, we deduce j ri  r  . as we show later, r is partly smooth at j relative to a, so the proximal operator proxr maps all matrices near j to disk matrices near j. computational tests again conrm this property. as we shall see , a necessary condition for x m to be a disk matrix is: x is unitarily similar to a matrix of the form a b c d for numbers a, b, c, d c satisfying the condition c = adb. in fact this condition along with the condition that a and d are both nonzero is also sucient for x a . for x near j, these necessary and sucient conditions are equivalent, and furthermore easy to check computationally by reduction to schur form. we show that the numerical radius is partly smooth at all such matrices, relative to a. by contrast, we argue at the end of this work that the numer- ical radius r is not partly smooth relative to the set of disk matrices a (or indeed any subset) at the disk matrix e = . our later results imply e ri  r  , so certainly we have proxr   e  = e however, the lack of partial smoothness means that there is no guarantee that the proximal operator proxr maps matrices near e to disk matrices. the general case extending the three-by-three case to mn for n > involves not a jordan block but the crabb matrix k = . this matrix has eld of values the unit disk, and again following the reasoning in , the matrix h = n is a subgradient of the numerical radius r at k, in fact belonging to ri  r  . as we show later, r is partly smooth at k relative to the disk matrices a, so the proximal operator proxr maps all matrices near k + h to disk matrices near k. again, we can verify this behavior computationally. as we shall see, a necessary condition for a matrix x to be a disk matrix (by proposition ) is that the maximal eigenvalues max, as w ranges over any subset of t of cardinality n + , are all equal. this necessary condition is easy to check computationally, and in fact it is also sucient for x near k (by proposition ). this matrix was called the choi-crouzeix matrix in . many thanks to a. salemi for providing the reference and pointing out that as a consequence of crabbs results, the conjectures on and are true. a third conjecture on remains open. the subdierential of the numerical radius at disk matrices clearly both the eld of values w and the numerical radius r are invariant under unitary similarity transformations on the matrix x. since we can write r = max  re : w c, |w| = , u cn, u= , it follows immediately that the function r is a norm. our analysis depends heavily on the hermitian part linear map : mn hn, dened by = . notice that this map is the adjoint of the natural embedding: : hn mn is given by = z , since x, = , z = d , z e =  x, z+ x, z  =  re tr + re tr  =  re tr + re tr  =  re tr + re tr  = x, z. we will be interested in the largest eigenvalue max of matrices of the form for scalars w on the unit circle t c. we use the following result (dating back to ) extensively: since its proof is simple, we include it. proposition for any matrix x mn, max  w, z: z w = max    for all w t. hence x has numerical radius r = max wt max    , and has eld of values a disk of radius if and only if max    = for all w t. proof consider the rst equation. the eld of values is nonempty and compact, so the maximum on the left-hand side is indeed attained. furthermore we have max  w, z: z w = max  re : u cn, u= = max  : u cn, u= = max n u   u : u cn, u= o = max    , so the rst equation follows. the second equation is an immediate consequence. one direction in the nal equivalence is also immediate, and the converse follows since the eld of values w is convex by the toeplitz-hausdortheorem. lemma given a matrix x mn and a scalar w t, suppose that the matrix (w x) has simple largest eigenvalue, with a corresponding unit eigenvector g. then the function x max    is analytic on mn around x, and its gradient there is wgg. furthermore, the following condition holds: wgg, x= max  (w x)  . proof since the largest eigenvalue of the matrix (w x) is simple, it is well known that the function max: hn r is locally analytic there, with gradient gg. therefore, for small matrices z hn we have max   w( x + z)  max  (w x)  = max   w x) +  max  (w x)  = gg, + o. using the adjoint property , notice gg, = , wz = re tr  ggwz  = wgg, z . the expression for the gradient follows. we then note wgg, x = re tr  wgg x  = re  gw xg  = g (w x)  g = gmax  (w x)  g = max  (w x)  , using the denition of g. we next dene a set-valued mapping : mn mn by =  wgg: w t, g= , g = max    g , and a set of matrices =  x mn : max    is simple for all w t proposition on the open set , the set-valued mappings x and x conv    are both continuous. proof suppose the set is not open, so there exists a matrix x , and a sequence xr x with xr for all r = , , , . . .. by denition, for each r there exists a scalar wr t such that the second largest eigenvalue  (w rxr)  equals the largest max  (w rxr)  . after taking a subsequence, we can suppose wr converges to some scalar w t, but then, since the map and both the eigenvalues max and are continuous, we deduce the contradiction    = max    . hence is indeed open. to prove continuity, we use lemma , which shows that, for any scalar w t, the function f : mn r dened by f = max    is analytic throughout the set . furthermore, the gradient of f at any matrix x is given by f = wggfor any unit eigenvector g corresponding to the eigenvalue max    . now consider a sequence xr x in . we prove in two steps. first, we observe that any limit point y of a sequence yr must lie in . to see this, after taking a subsequence we can suppose yr y , and yr = wrgrg r for some scalar wr t and unit vector gr satisfying (w rxr)gr = max  (w rxr)  gr for all r. taking a further subsequence, we can suppose wr approaches some scalar w t and gr approaches some unit vector g. by continuity we deduce y = wgg and g = max    g, so we have shown y , as desired. secondly, given any matrix y , we prove the existence of a sequence yr converging to y . to do so, rst write y = wggfor some unit eigenvector g corresponding to the eigenvalue max    , so y = f. if we dene yr = f for each r, then analyticity implies yr y , and applying lemma at each xr shows yr , as desired. continuity of the map and the eigenvalue max shows that, for any matrix x , the image is always closed, and clearly every element has norm one, so the mapping is also locally bounded. continuity of the mapping x conv    now follows in a standard fashion . theorem at any matrix x in the set a of ma- trices whose elds of values are disks centered at zero, the subdierential of the numerical radius r satises r = conv    par  r  = xspan    , where the set-valued mapping is dened by equation . on the intersection of a with the set dened by equation , the numerical radius is analytic and its subdierential is continuous. proof we can write equation as r = max wt max g= wgg, x, for all matrices x mn, so r = conv  wgg: w t, g= , wgg, x= r . for any xed scalar w t, the inner maximum in the expression for the numerical radius equals the eigenvalue max    , and the attaining set consists of all corresponding unit eigenvectors g. for any matrix x a, the outer maximum is attained on the whole set t, and hence r = conv    . the second equation follows from proposition . continuity follows by proposition , and since for all x a we have r = max    , analyticity follows from lemma . matrices with eld of values the unit disk let b denote the set of matrices with eld of values the unit disk; hence a = r+b. in this section we describe conditions under which b is locally a manifold. we focus on the subset b , consisting of those matrices x b for which the largest eigenvalue of the matrix equals one and is simple for all scalars w t. we begin with a tool for characterizing when a matrix is in b, or equivalently, in b , given that it is close to a given matrix in b . proposition consider any matrix x in the set b mn. then for any matrix x near x, and any set t t of cardinality at least n + , the following properties are equivalent. x b. max    = for all w t. i is singular for all w t. i is singular for all w t. max    = for all w t. proof the implications follow from proposition . the impli- cation is immediate. notice the identity wn det   i  = det  wi  for all w t. the right-hand side is a polynomial in w of degree at most n, so it vanishes ev- erywhere on the set t if and only if it vanishes everywhere on t. it follows that properties and are equivalent. suppose the implication fails. then there exists a sequence of matrices xr converging to x, and scalars wr t, such that is an eigenvalue of the matrix (w rxr) and yet is not its largest eigenvalue. consequently, its second largest eigenvalue satises  (w rxr)  for all r. after taking a subsequence, we can suppose wr w t, and we deduce by continuity  (w x)  but this contradicts our assumption that the matrix (w x) has a simple largest eigenvalue equal to we now dene functions f : t cn and f : t mn by f = w w w . . . wn and f = wff= w w w wn w w w wn w w w wn w w w w wn . . . . . . . . . . . . wn wn wn wn w proposition for any set t t of cardinality at most n+, the set of vectors {f : w t} is anely independent in the euclidean space cn, and the set of matrices {f : w t} is linearly independent in the euclidean space mn. proof we begin with the rst claim. suppose that it fails for some set t of distinct scalars w, w, w, . . . , wm where m n + without loss of generality, we can assume m = n + : otherwise, simply augment the set t. then the linear map : rn+ r cn dened by = x j yj,  n+ x j= yjwk j n k= ! is not one-to-one. since dim rn+ = n+ = dim, the map is not onto either, and hence its adjoint : rcn rn+ is not one-to-one. in other words, there exists a scalar r and x cn, not both zero, such that = by denition, for all vectors y rn+ we have , y = , = n+ x j= yj + re  n x k= x k n+ x j= yjwk j  = n+ x j= yj  + re n x k= x kwk j  so for j = , , , . . ., n + we have =    j = + re p k x kwk j . however, the nonzero real trigonometric polynomial + re p k x keik can have at most n zeroes , which is a contradiction. this completes the proof of the rst claim. the second claim follows immediately, since, for all w t, the rst column of the matrix f is the vector f, and the entry equals corollary in the euclidean space cn+, the convex set conv n  f  : w t o has dimension n. proof the given set, which we denote by s, contains the set n  f  : w t o for any set t t. by choosing t of cardinality exactly n+, we see by proposition that s contains n+ linearly independent vectors, and hence has dimension at least n. on the other hand, y = for all vectors y s, so s can have dimension no more than n. to prove that the set b of matrices with eld of values the unit disk is a manifold locally, we focus on matrices x b , and make one further assumption: that the matrix parametrized by w t has an eigenvector corresponding to the simple eigenvalue max    = whose components are linearly independent polynomials in w of degree less than n. at rst sight, this assumption seems articial, but in the sections that follow we provide motivation and examples. theorem consider any matrix x mn. suppose there exists an invertible matrix g mn such that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix is simple and equal to one for all scalars w t, with a corresponding eigenvector gf. then x b and the set b of matrices with eld of values the unit disk is an analytic manifold around x of codimension n + its tangent and normal spaces at x are tb = n y mn : gfg, y = for all w t o nb = g  span  f : w t  g. proof that x b is immediate from proposition . for each scalar w t, denote the normalized eigenvector gfgf by g. choose any any set t t of cardinality exactly n + by proposition , the set b is described locally by the analytic equations in its property . we see from lemma that the gradients of the left-hand sides of these equations are linearly independent, since for any y rn+, the relationship x j yjwjgg= implies = x j yjwjgfgffg = g  x j yjgf wjff g = g  x j yjgff  g, and hence x j  yjgf f = , and then proposition shows yjgf = for all j and so y = the manifold property follows and tb = n y mn : wgg, y = for all w t o . since t was arbitrary, the formula for the tangent space follows, and that for the normal space is an immediate consequence.","The text discusses proving partial smoothness of the numerical radius around various matrices, including the

"our next step is to lift the main result in the previous section from the set b to the set of disk matrices a. we rst note a computational technique for recognizing when a matrix is in a, given that it is close to a given matrix in a . proposition consider any xed matrix x in the set a mn and any set t t of cardinality at least n + a nec- essary condition for a matrix x mn to be a disk matrix is that the eigenvalues  max    : w t should all be equal. for x near x, this condition is also sucient. proof the case n = is an easy exercise, relying on the fact that a scalar x c is zero if and only if re takes identical values for at least three distinct scalars w t. we can therefore assume n > the necessary condition is clear from proposition . suppose the converse fails, so there exists a sequence of matrices outside a converging to x and a real sequence such that max    = s for all w t, and all s. clearly we have s r( x) > in particular, we can assume s > for all s. but now we have s xs r( x) x b , so we can apply proposition to deduce the contradiction sxs b for all large s. we next establish a simple tool. lemma consider any matrix x b. for all real > , the set a of disk matrices coincides with the set a =  x : x b, r, x x< , | | < around x. proof since the eld of values satises w = w for all real > , we clearly always have a a. conversely, consider any sequence of matrices xk x in a. the numerical radius r is continuous, so r r( x) = now note rxk b, so xk a eventually. the result follows. proposition consider a euclidean space e, and a set s e that is a k-dim- ensional analytic manifold around a point s s. suppose that s does not lie in the tangent space ts( s). then for all small > , the set  s : s s, r, s s< , | | < is a -dimensional manifold around s, and its tangent space there is ts( s)+r s. proof denote the open unit ball in the space e by b. by choosing suitable local coordinates for the manifold s we can suppose there is an analytic map p : b e such that p = s and with derivative dp one-to-one throughout b and such that the image p is an open neighborhood of s in s. in that case the tangent space ts( s) is just the range of dp. now dene an analytic map q: b r e by q = p. notice = dq = dpy + s implies = , since by assumption the vector s does not lie in the range of dp and the map dp is one-to-one. therefore the derivative map dq is also one-to-one at the vector , so it is one-to-one throughout the set b for all small > the image of this set under the map q is the given set, so the result now follows. we deduce the main result of this section. theorem consider any matrix x in mn. suppose there exists an invertible matrix g mn such that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix is simple and independent of the scalar w t, with a corresponding eigenvector gf. then around x, the set a of disk matrices is an analytic manifold of codimension n. its tangent and normal spaces at x are ta = rx + n y mn : gfg, y = for all w t o na = xg  span  f : w t  g. on a, around x, the numerical radius is analytic and its subdierential is contin- uous and satises r = g  conv  gff : w t  g par  r  = na. hence the numerical radius is partly smooth at the matrix x relative to a. proof the case n = is an easy exercise, so we assume n > suppose rst that the largest eigenvalue of is for all w: in other words, the matrix x has numerical radius using theorem and the notation of its proof, to apply proposition we just need to check x tb. this follows from lemma , which shows in fact re  wgxg  = for all w t. the properties of the subdierential of the numerical radius follow from theorem . the result follows. to prove the general case, dene the positive scalar = r, and apply the previous argument to the matrix x. since the set a is closed under scalar multi- plication, it is easy to check na = na. furthermore, since the numerical radius is positively homogeneous, it is also easy to check r = r. this completes the proof.","In the section on disk matrices, the main result is lifted from a set b to a set of disk matrices a. A computational technique is introduced for recognizing when a matrix is a disk matrix, involving eigenvalues being equal. The section also covers the relationship between disk matrices and a k-dimensional manifold, as well as proving that the set of disk matrices around a given matrix forms an analytic manifold of codimension n. The tangent and normal spaces at a matrix x are defined, and it is shown that the numerical radius is analytic and partly smooth at x relative to a."
"according to proposition , a matrix x mn belongs to the set b of matrices with eld of values the unit disk if and only if the hermitian matrix has largest eigenvalue equal to one for all scalars w t. to guarantee that b is a manifold around x, theorem rst made a modest renement of the basic assumption: that the largest eigenvalue is also simple for all w t. secondly, however, we made a more opaque assumption: that we can associate with this eigenvalue a corresponding eigenvector whose components are linearly independent polynomials in w of degree less than n. we now explore this assumption, using a result from . a somewhat related characterization appears in , theorem a matrix in mn has eld of values the unit disk if and only if it has the form x = u for some matrix b hn satisfying i b and some unitary u mn such that the matrix u w is singular for all scalars w t. in this theorem statement, we can write sin b = v v and cos b = v v, for some unitary v mn and nonnegative vectors s, c rn satisfying s j + c j = for j = , , , . . . , n. with this notation, we have v xv = and the matrix w) is singular for all w t. hence we lose no essential generality in assuming, when convenient, that v = i, or in other words that b is diagonal. proposition for matrices x as described in theorem , the eigenspace cor- responding to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix is just the nullspace of the matrix u w. proof by theorem and proposition , we know max    = consider any vector v in the nullspace of the matrix u w. we deduce wuv = v wuv = v adding shows v = v, as required. conversely, if v = v, then we have  uv wv = uv + wv  uv  wv   wv  uv  = v + v vv = , as required. any matrix with eld of values the unit disk can be written in the form de- scribed in theorem . in that result, the matrix u w must be singular for all scalars w t, or in matrix-analytic terminology, the matrix pencil u w is singular. theorem needs more: in particular, the largest eigenvalue of the matrix should be simple, or equivalently (by proposition ) the nullspace of uw should be one-dimensional for all w t. assuming this, the nullspace is in general spanned by some vector having all components polynomial in w, as can be seen quickly by reducing the matrix polynomial u w to smith normal formal . however, theorem needs more precise knowledge of this eigenvector of . rather than delving into the theory of singular pencil canonical forms, we simply assume that the n components of this vector can be taken to be linearly independent complex polynomials of degree less than n, or equivalently, that the vector can be written in the form gf, where the matrix g mn is invertible. this assumption will suce for the examples we consider. theorem suppose for some matrix b hn satisfying i b , and some unitary u mn, there exists an invertible g mn such that null  u w  = cgf for all scalars w t. then around the matrix x = u the set a of disk matrices is an analytic manifold of codimension n. its tangent and normal spaces at x are ta = rx + n y mn : gfg, y = for all w t o na = xg  span  f : w t  g. on a, around x, the numerical radius is analytic and its subdierential is contin- uous and satises r = g  conv  gff : w t  g par  r  = na. in particular, the numerical radius is partly smooth at the matrix x relative to the manifold a. proof this follows directly from proposition and theorem . we consider two special cases: two-by-two matrices and superdiagonal matrices.","The Crouzeix parametrization states that a matrix belongs to a set of matrices with values in the unit disk if the largest eigenvalue of its hermitian matrix is one for all scalars. This set forms a manifold around the matrix under certain assumptions. The matrix can be expressed in a specific form involving singular matrices and unitary matrices. The nullspace of the matrix corresponds to the largest eigenvalue and can be written in terms of polynomial vectors. Around this matrix, there exists an analytic manifold of codimension n, with specific tangent and normal spaces defined. The numerical radius on this manifold is analytic and has a continuous subdifferential. This parametrization is further explained through examples of two-by-two matrices and superdiagonal matrices."
"as shown in , a two-by-two matrix is a disk matrix if and only if it is unitarily similar to a multiple of the two-by-two jordan block. in theorem , we could take u =   and b =   , so x = u =       =   and u w =     w   =  w  . thus g = i satises the assumptions of the theorem, so the numerical radius is partly smooth at x relative to a.","A two-by-two matrix is considered a disk matrix if it can be transformed unitarily to a multiple of a two-by-two Jordan block. The theorem demonstrates this by setting specific values for the matrices involved, showing that the numerical radius is smoothly partial at a certain point x."
"more generally, writing matrices in mn by partitioning both rows and columns into blocks of size , n , and , consider the case u = e j en and b = diag , where j denotes the -by- jordan block, e, en rn are the canonical unit vectors, j = . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , e = . . . , en = . . . and the vector rn has entries in the interval (, ). notice sin b = diag s and cos b = diag c , where the entries sj, cj satisfy s j + c j = for all j = , , , . . ., n , so u w = w ce j w en . a calculation shows that the matrix g = diag g, where g = and gj+ = sj cj gj satises the assumptions of theorem . hence the numer- ical radius is partly smooth, relative to the manifold a, around the matrix x = u = ce j snen , or more explicitly, x = sc . . . sc . . . . . . . . . . . . sncn . . . . for example, setting sj = = cj for all j = , , , . . . , n gives x = , the crabb matrix. in fact, we have the following more general result. we begin with a simple tool concerning real sequences. for notational simplicity, and with no loss of generality, we present it for innite sequences. lemma for any strictly positive real sequence b, b, b, . . ., there exists a de- creasing sequence += t > t > t > > and a sequence of continuous, strictly increasing functions hj : [, tj) r+, for all j = , , , . . ., satisfying hj = , hj = , lim ttj hj = +, h = bt for all t r+, and hj+ = bj+t hj for all t [, tj+). proof we construct the numbers tj and the functions hj recursively. given the continuous, strictly increasing function hj : [, tj) r+ satisfying hj = and limttj hj = +, by the intermediate value theorem there exists a number tj+ such that hj = now the function hj+ dened by equation is continuous, strictly increasing and satises hj+ = and limttj+ hj+ = +, as required. we can now prove the following result. theorem at any matrix in mn of the form a a an an , for nonzero a, a, . . . , an c, the numerical radius is partly smooth relative to the set a of disk matrices. proof we covered the case n = in section , so assume n > we claim that any matrix of the form is unitarily similar to a nonzero multiple of a matrix of the form . to see this, rst note that, by diagonal unitary scaling we can rst assume that each scalar aj is real and strictly positive. we now seek numbers sj, cj satisfying s j + c j = for all j = , , , . . ., n and such that the vector is a multiple of the vector . as in the discussion before equation , we set s = = cn squaring com- ponentwise, we can write this problem as solving, for cj and t > , the equations c = tb, ( c j)c j+ = tbj+ , cn = , where bj = a j for all j. using the notation of the lemma, these equations are equivalent to c j = hj for j n , so are solvable: the unique solution is t = tn and cj = p hj for j n as we claimed, therefore, our matrix is unitarily similar to a nonzero multiple of a matrix of the form . as in the discussion of that example, the result now follows from theorem . we could, if desired, compute the numbers cj recursively as described in the proof of lemma .","The section discusses matrices partitioned into blocks, focusing on the superdiagonal case where the matrix is of the form u = ce^j, an^n.

The unitary similarity of matrices of a specific form is explained, leading to the conclusion that the numerical radius is partly smooth. The text presents detailed calculations and proofs supporting these results."
"we end with a thorough study of -by- disk matrices. in particular, we show that theorem has applications beyond matrices with the sparsity pattern of a jordan block and their unitary similarity transformations. any disk matrix has a zero eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity at least two, as shown in . via schur factorization, appropriately ordering the eigen- values, any disk matrix in m is therefore unitarily similar to a matrix of the form  s  with s =  a b c d  for numbers a, b, c, d c. (the factor is just for convenience, to simplify our later calculations.) furthermore, as we show below , the condition c = adb must hold. in other words, if we dene two nonconvex cones of matrices, = n  a b c d  : condition holds o and e =  u[ s ]u: u m unitary, s , then, in the space m, the set of disk matrices a is contained in e. however, as we shall also see, this containment is strict. to organize the discussion, assuming condition , exactly one of the following additional labeled conditions must hold: a = and d = a = and d = a = and d = a = and d = and |c| < |b| a = and d = and |c| = |b| a = and d = and |c| > |b| notice that the second and third conditions both entail c = , by condition , resulting in matrices of the form that are nilpotent. based on these mutually exclusive conditions, we can partition the set into corresponding disjoint subsets, = == == == ==< === ==>, and we can then write the set e as a union of corresponding subsets, e = e== e== e== e==< e=== e==>. this latter union is not, however, disjoint, as the following observation makes clear. proposition the sets e== and e== are identical and consist of the nilpotent matrices in the set e==<. proof we simply observe, for example, that the matrices b d and |b| + |d| are unitarily similar. to see this, consider the unitary similarity transformation corresponding to u = [ v ], where the -by- unitary matrix v maps the vector [ b d ] to the vector [ |b|+|d| ]. with this result in mind, we can write e = e== e==< e=== e==>, and, as we shall see, this is indeed a partition into disjoint sets, and one well suited to understanding the set a of disk matrices and the numerical radius r. specically, we devote this section to showing the following result. recall that is the open subset of m dened in equation . theorem in the -dimensional space m, the set e== is a -dimensional manifold. its closure is the set of disk matrices, which can be partitioned into three disjoint sets: a = cl e== = e== e==< e===. these sets satisfy a = e== e==<. the subdierential of the numerical radius r has dimension throughout e== and throughout e==<. the numerical radius is partly smooth at a disk matrix x relative to a if and only if x e==. we begin the proof with some simple algebraic observations about the parti- tion . proposition the following relationships hold: cl == = \ ==> and cl e== = e \ e==>. proof for any number b c and nonzero d c, we have lim  b db +|d| d  =  b d  , so == cl, and similarly == cl. on the other hand, for any numbers c, d c satisfy- ing |c| < |b|, the real number t = s |c| |b|   satises t + t + |c| |b| = , so for > we have  c b c bt   == == . this matrix converges to the matrix [ b c ] as , so using property we deduce ==< cl. since we obviously have === cl, we deduce cl \ ==>. the opposite inclusion is easy: when a and d are nonzero, condition implies |c| |b|, since |a| + |d| |ad| the second equation is a simple consequence, using the compactness of the set of unitary matrices. we next introduce a simple tool. lemma consider a matrix x unitarily similar to a matrix of the form . the characteristic polynomial of the matrix , namely det  i  , is + w, c+ + w, adbc|b| proof if x is unitarily similar to a matrix e in the form , then the charac- teristic polynomial of is identical with that of , namely det   i  = det wa wb wa wc+ wc wd wb wd , and the result follows. we can now characterize disk matrices in m theorem the set of disk matrices in m is e \ e==>. proof we need to show that a matrix x m is a disk matrix if and only if it is unitarily similar to a matrix of the form [ s ] for a matrix s \ ==>. to this end, consider any x with eld of values a disk of radius r as we noted, x is unitarily similar to a matrix of the form , so by lemma the characteristic polynomial of is + w, c+ + w, adbc|b| by proposition , for all w t we have r + rw, c+ r + w, adbc|b|= by considering w = and adding we deduce r = p |a| + |d| + |b| substituting into the previous equation gives w, c + adb= for all w t, and equation follows. if in addition we have s ==>, then r = |b|. our previous calculation shows det   i  = + w, c+ |b| |b|w, c =   |b|)  , so the matrix has eigenvalues w, cand |b|. setting w = |c|c now gives r = max = |c|, a contradiction. conversely, consider any matrix e of the form , where s but s / ==>. we want to prove max    = p |a| + |d| + |b| for all w t, which will imply that e, along with any matrix that is unitarily similar to e, is a disk matrix. lemma shows det   i  = + w, c+ w, c =    , so the matrix has eigenvalues w, cand p |a| + |d| + |b| the result now follows immediately in the case when a = = d, since then by assumption |c| |b|. it also follows if either a or d is nonzero, since equation then implies |c| < p |a| + |d| + |b| to see this, note the equivalent form |c| < p |a| + |d| + |b| or equivalently |a||d||b| < p |a| + |d| + |b| squaring gives |a||d||b| < or equivalently the valid inequality < |b| + this completes the proof of the converse direction. examining the proof, we have in particular shown the following result. notice that, having already discarded the subset ==>, this reveals the special role of the subset ===. lemma a matrix e of the form is a disk matrix if and only if the matrix s lies in the set \ ==>. in that case, e has numerical radius max    = p |a| + |d| + |b| for all w t. furthermore this largest eigenvalue is simple for all w t if and only if s ===. discarding the set === rules out the case of the zero matrix, so by scaling we can focus our attention on matrices with eld of values the unit disk. in this context, we next further discard the set ==<. lemma a matrix e of the form has eld of values the unit disk if and only if the matrix s lies in the set \ ==> and |a| + |d| + |b| = assume this is the case. then max    = for all w t. furthermore, this largest eigenvalue is simple for all w t if and only if we have s ===. if we further assume that a and d are not both zero , then a corresponding unit eigenvector is p wa + bd |b| ba + wd . proof by our previous calculations we know, for all w t, that the matrix i = wa wb wa wc+ wc wd wb wd has nullity one. it is easy to verify  wa wb wb wd  wa + bd |b| ba + wd =   , so the given vector is indeed an eigenvector, and the square of its norm is |a| + |b||d| + w, adb+ + |a||b| + |d| + w, adb = as required. we are now ready to consider partial smoothness. theorem consider any matrix e of the form , for a matrix s in the set ==. then e belongs to the set a of disk matrices. around e, furthermore, a is a -dimensional analytic manifold in the -dimensional space m, with normal space at e given by na = eg  span  f : w t  g, where g is the invertible matrix g = a bd |b| ab d . the numerical radius is partly smooth at e relative to a, and its subdierential there, r, has dimension proof as in the proof of theorem , we lose no generality in rst scaling the matrix e to ensure |a| + |d| + |b| = then, by lemma , the eigenvalue max    = is simple for all scalars w t, with a corresponding eigenvector gf = aw + bdw w baw + dw . the result now follows by theorem . corollary the semi-algebraic set a of all disk matrices in m has dimen- sion proof by proposition and theorem , any disk matrix is a limit of matrices x unitarily similar to those of the form considered in theorem . that result shows that the set of such matrices x is a semi-algebraic manifold of dimension , so its closure also has dimension by contrast, we have the following result. proposition any matrix x e==< is a disk matrix: in fact x a . however, the subdierential of the numerical radius r has dimension consequently, the numerical radius is not partly smooth at x relative to any subset of a. proof after a unitary similarity transformation, we can suppose x = b c , with |c| < |b|. the claim x a follows from lemma . by lemma , for all scalars w t, the eigenvalue max    = |b| is simple, and a quick calculation shows that a corresponding unit eigenvector is  uw where u = b |b|. now theorem implies that the numerical radius has subdierential at x given by r = conv w u uw w : w t . we can rewrite the matrix in this equation as the image of the vector under a one-to-one linear map, so by corollary we see that r has dimension finally, by denition, any manifold with respect to which the numerical radius is partly smooth at x must have dimension = , and hence cannot be a subset of the -dimensional set a. we can summarize some of our observations in the following renement of the- orem , giving the nal ingredient in the proof of theorem . corollary for any matrix x in the set of disk matrices a in m, the numer- ical radius is partly smooth at x relative to a if and only if x e==. proof we can suppose that x is unitarily similar to a matrix e = [ s ] for a matrix s \ ==>. we claim that the numerical radius is partly smooth at e relative to a if and only if s ==. in the light of theorem and proposition , the only case left to consider is s ===. in the case s == we know dim r = , whereas in the case s ==< we have dim r = but when s ===, our matrix can be written both as a limit of matrices e a with s == or alternatively with s ==<, by proposition and equation , so dim r is not continuous there relative to a, contradicting partial smoothness. it is interesting to consider the impact of these results on optimization problems involving the numerical radius r on m for example, by theorems and , the prox operator proxr commonly maps a random matrix y to a disk matrix, which is therefore unitarily similar to a matrix e = [ s ] for a matrix s \ ==>. in particular, the case s == occurs with positive probability, and this property is stable under perturbations to y . worth noting is that the case s === can also occur stably with positive probability. for example, the prox operator proxr maps any small matrix to the zero matrix. on the other hand, the case s ==< covered by proposition (as well as the cases s == ==) do not display this same stable behavior. for almost all matrices y , the numerical radius, being semi-algebraic, will indeed be partly smooth around proxr relative to some manifold m . however, even if proxr were a disk matrix of one of these three forms, m could not be a subset of a locally, so certain small perturbations to y would produce matrices other than disk matrices. the crouzeix ratio in the -by- case it is interesting to compare how two families given in t into the discussion of this section. let y = , c, || and z = ei cos sin sin cos , h , i , r. crouzeix proved in that these matrices, along with their unitary similarity transformations, are the only matrices x with eld of values the unit disk and inf max{|p| : || } p : p is a polynomial of any degree  = note that the ratio in is a special case of the one in the equation above, with p = n indeed, since permuting the rows and columns of y results in a block diagonal matrix with one block equal to the scaled jordan block discussed in section , and a second block equal to the scalar with || , when x = y the inmum in the equation above is attained by p = . when = , the matrix z can also, by permuting rows and columns, be transformed to essentially the same block diagonal form, while when = , z is a unimodular scalar times the scaled jordan block discussed in section , and the inmum is attained by p = in general, however, for x = z the inmum is not attained . we can apply the results in this section directly to the matrices y and z. in particular, the numerical radius is partly smooth relative to the set of disk ma- trices at the matrix z if and only if = , and is not so at the matrix y .","The section delves into a detailed examination of three-by-three disk matrices, showing their characteristics and relationships with similar matrices. It demonstrates that any disk matrix has a zero eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity at least two, and provides conditions for unitary similarity transformations. By organizing the discussion around specific conditions, the section partitions the set of disk matrices into disjoint subsets. It concludes with results on the numerical radius and partial smoothness of disk matrices, highlighting their implications for optimization problems. The section also discusses the Crouzeix ratio in the three-by-three case, showcasing the uniqueness of certain matrices with field values in the unit disk and exploring their properties."
"in this paper, we have analyzed the partly smooth geometry of the numerical radius around disk matrices those whose elds of values are disks in the complex plane centered at the origin. we have argued that such matrices arise naturally as solu- tions of optimization problems involving the numerical radius, supported by both numerical experiments and subdierential analysis. even in the case of matrices of order three, the details are surprisingly subtle. our development blends matrix and variational analysis, but makes no use of semidenite programming characterizations of the numerical

"resistance distance in graphs has played a prominent role not only in circuit theory and chemistry , but also in combinatorial matrix theory and spectral graph theory . many of the methods for calculating resistance distance, e.g., those making use of the laplacian matrix are o where n is the number of vertices of the graph. furthermore, the relationship between these resistance distances and the structure of the underlying graph is not well understood except in special cases. an under-utilized method of calculating the resistance distance between two vertices u and v in a graph g is by determining the number of spanning -forests separating u and v in g and the number of spanning trees of g . thus, if the number of spanning trees is known, calculating the number of spanning -forests and resistance distance are equivalent problems. this work presents new reduction formulas for determining these quantities for -connected graphs. we apply these results to a new family of linear -trees generalizing the work of . we begin with the following notation and denitions. let g be an undirected graph in which multiple edges are allowed but loops are not. let v denote the vertex set of g and unless otherwise specied v = {, , . . . , n}. finally, let t denote the number of spanning trees of g. denition given any two vertices u and v of g, a spanning -forest separating u and v is a spanning forest with two components such that u and v are in distinct components. the number of such forests is denoted by fg. in addition, we occasionally consider spanning -forests separating a vertex u from a pair of vertices v and w. we denote the number of these by fg. it follows from the matrix tree theorem that for any j {, , . . . , n}, t = det lg where lg is the combinatorial laplacian matrix of g, and lg is the matrix obtained from lg by deleting the jth row and column. the following identity (see and th. of ) is a relative of the matrix tree theorem: fg = det lg, where lg is the matrix obtained from lg by deleting rows u, v and columns u, v. if g has a cut-vertex w and g = g g with g and g connected and v v = {w}, then it is evident that t = tt fg = fgt for u, v v fg = fgt + tfg for u v and v v . it is natural to ask if reduction formulae such as these can be found for graphs with no cut vertex, and the answer is in the armative if the graph has a cut-set of size for any graph g with a -separator {i, j} and associated decomposition g = g g, one can express t in terms of t and fgk, k = , , and, furthermore, for any pair of vertices u, v v one can express fg in terms of t, fgk, and fg/ij for k {, }, x {u, v} and y {i, j}. here g/ij denotes the graph obtained by identifying vertices i and j . this is theorem and is one of the main results of the next section. this reduction is particularly eective if the sizes of g and g are comparable, and if there are multiple -separators. as previously mentioned we also consider the important and closely related concept of resistance distance or eective resistance. consider g as an electric circuit with unit resistance on each edge, and suppose one unit of current ows into vertex i and one unit of current ows out of vertex j. then the resistance distance rg between vertices u and v is the eective resistance between u and v. alternatively, one can give a mathematical formulation rg = t l g, where denotes the moore-penrose inverse. the following theorem gives the relationship between the resistance distance between u and v and the number of spanning -forests separating u and v. theorem given a graph g, the resistance distance between vertices u and v is given by rg = fg t . returning to the case where g has a cut-vertex w as described on the previous page, we divide by tt and applying theorem we obtain rg = rg, a much shorter proof than the one given of the same result, theorem in . dividing by tt we see that if w is a cut vertex of g and u and v lie in distinct components of g w, then rg = rg + rg aside from , there seem to be few applications of theorem to the calculation of resistance distance. one signicant example is the proof of the second statement of theorem in . our reduction formulae open the possibility of nding closed forms for resistance distances in many additional graphs. we illustrate this for the sierpinski triangle and the family of linear -trees with a single bend in section . denition a linear -tree on n vertices is a graph g satisfying the following properties. g has n edges. k is not a subgraph of g. g is chordal . g has two degree two vertices. alternatively, a linear -tree is a graph g that is constructed inductively by starting with a triangle and connecting each new vertex to the vertices of an existing edge that includes a vertex of degree denition . a straight linear -tree is a graph gn with n vertices with adjacency matrix that is symmetric, banded, with the rst and second subdiagonals equal to one, the rst and second superdiagonals equal to one, and all other entries equal to zero. see figure n n n n n figure : a straight linear -tree in the authors obtained an explicit formula for the resistance distance between any two vertices in a straight linear -tree on n vertices, and veried that the number of spanning trees of a straight linear -tree is fn, where fk is the kth fibonacci num- ber. consequently, the number of spanning -forests separating two vertices can be found immediately from theorem a linear -tree with a single bend can be obtained from two straight linear -trees. this fact and theorem are applied in section to obtain an explicit formula for all resistance distances in the family of linear -trees with a single bend. if u and v are the end vertices of this bent linear -tree on n vertices, the number of spanning -forests separating u and v is less than the the number in the straight linear -tree by the product of four fibonacci numbers.","Resistance distance in graphs is a key concept with applications in various fields such as circuit theory, chemistry, combinatorial matrix theory, and spectral graph theory. The calculation of resistance distance involves determining the number of spanning trees and spanning forests in a graph. New reduction formulas have been developed for determining these quantities in graphs. The concept of resistance distance is related to the effective resistance between vertices in an electric circuit analogy. The relationship between resistance distance and the number of spanning forests separating two vertices is established through a theorem.

"denition a -separation of a graph g is a pair of subgraphs g, g such that v = v v , |v v | = , e = e e, and e e = . the pair of vertices, v v , is called a -separator of g. throughout this section, we will let g denote a graph with a -separation, g, g will denote the two graphs of the separation, and we will let {i, j} = v v . note that the graph resulting from the deletion of vertices i and j from g is a disconnected graph. theorem let g be a graph with a -separation as above. then t = tfg + tfg proof. if t is a spanning tree of g, then since {i, j} separates g and g, the unique path in t connecting i to j must lie either entirely in g or entirely in g then the restriction of t to the other side is a spanning -forest of that side separating i and j. by the multiplication principle, the result follows. before stating the rst analogous result for -forests, we need the following denition. denition if i, j are vertices of g, then g/ij is the graph obtained from g by identifying vertices i and j into a vertex we denote by ij. in the identication, any edge {u, i} or {u, j} with u = i, j is replaced by an edge {u, ij}. (so if i and j have a common neighbor v, then there is a double edge from v to ij in the new graph.) any edge {u, v} with neither u nor v equal to i or j remains. if {i, j} is an edge it disappears. theorem let g be as above, and let u, v v . then fg = fgfg + fg/ijt. proof. let f be a spanning -forest in g that separates u and v. case : i and j belong to dierent components of f restricted to g then the restriction of f to g has components that separate u and v and the restriction to g has two components that separate i and j. by the multiplication principle, the number of ways to do this is fgfg case : i and j belong to the same component of f restricted to g then i and j are in the same component of f and thus in the same component of f as either u or v. without loss of generality, suppose they are in the same component of f as u. since i and j belong to the same component of f restricted to g, and i, j is a - separator for g, f restricted to g is a spanning tree of g then the path in f from i to j is in g and not in g, so the restriction of f to g has components, separating i, j, and v . then identifying i with j, we obtain a spanning -forest of g/ij that separates u from v. there are fg/ijt ways of doing this. denition if g is a graph with a -separator {i, j}, and corresponding -separation g, g, then a -switch is the operation that identies the copy of i in g with the copy of j in g and the copy of j in g with the copy of i in g . j i j i j i j i i j j i figure : -switch we note that we are following the terminology adopted in and remark that the term -switch has also been used in a dierent context with a distinct meaning. theorem let g be a graph with a -separator {i, j} and g the graph obtained by performing a -switch on i and j. then t = t. moreover, if u and v are both in g or both in g, then fg = fg and rg = rg. proof. the rst two equalities follow from theorems and respectively, since they depend only on the smaller graphs, not how they are joined together. the last follows from the rst two and theorem example after performing a -switch in the graph on the left in figure , we obtain the graph on the right. each edge label denotes the number of -forests separating the vertices incident to that edge. note that these are identical in the subgraph h induced on vertices {, , , , } and in the subgraph k induced by {, , , } as guaranteed by theorem the number of separating spanning -forests is also the same for non-adjacent vertices in h and k . figure : each edge label denotes the number of spanning -forests separating the vertices incident to the edge lemma let g be a graph, and let x, y, z be any vertices of g. then fg = fg + fg. proof. in any spanning -forest that separates x from z, the vertex y must be either in the same component as x or in the same component as z. theorem let g be a graph with a -separation, with i, j the two vertices separating the graph, and g, g the two graphs of the separation. let u v and v v . then fg =fg/ijt + fg/ijt + fgfg + fgfg fgfg proof. let h be a spanning -forest of g separating u from v. let h = h and h = h. case : h is a spanning tree of g then h has a single component containing v and i and j, so h cannot contain a path connecting i and j, since then h would have a cycle. thus h has three components: one containing i, one containing j, and one containing u. now identify vertices i and j in g, and let h result from identifying i and j in h then h is a spanning -forest of g/ij separating u from the vertex ij. by the multiplication principle, the number of possible h in this case is thus fg/ijt. case : h is a spanning tree of g note that this case is completely disjoint from case , since if both h and h were spanning trees of g and g respectively, then h would not separate u and v. by an argument symmetric to case , the number of spanning -forests arising in this case is fg/ijt. case : neither h nor h is a spanning tree of g or g claim : the number of spanning -forests for case is given by fgfg + fgfg + fg + fg proof. since h is a spanning -forest of g separating u from v, then we have the following possibilities: h separates {u, i} from {v, j}, h separates {u, j} from {v, i}, h separates {u, i, j} from v, or h separates {v, i, j} from u. now we consider how h restricts to g and g in the possibility where {u, i} and {v, j} are separated, h restricted to g is a spanning -forest of g separating {u, i} and j, while h restricted to g is a spanning -forest of g separating {v, j} and i. this yields the rst term of the claim. the possibility where {u, j} and {v, i} are separated is symmetric and yields the second term of the claim. in the remaining possibilities, one of the vertices u or v, is separated from the other three. we consider the possibility where u is separated from {i, j, v} and note that the possibility where v is separated from {i, j, u} is symmetric to it. let h be the restriction of h to g since we are in case , h is not a spanning tree of g and has components. let x be a vertex of h not in the component of v. the unique path from x to v in h contains an edge of g since {i, j} is a -separator, the path from x to v contains both i and j. thus, either i or j is in a dierent component than v. so, h is either a spanning -forest of g which separates v, i from j, or separates v, j from i. since there is not a path from i to j in h, there is a path from i to j in the restriction of h to g so, the restriction of h to g is a -forest of g separating u and {i, j}. this yields the third term of the claim. the fourth term corresponds to the symmetric possibility of v being separated from {i, j, u} in h. a substantial application of theorem is found in section applying lemma to the third and fourth terms in the right-hand side of the formula claimed in the theorem in every applicable instance, taking y to be equal to either i or j as appropriate, we nd that fgfg + fgfg fgfg simplies to the formula of claim this completes the proof. lemma let g be any graph, and let x, y, z be any vertices of g. then fg = fg + fg fg proof. interchanging the roles of x, y, z in lemma , we get the system fg = fg + fg fg = fg + fg fg = fg + fg. solving this system yields the desired result. from lemma we obtain an alternative form of the formula in theorem this eliminates counting spanning -forests that separate a vertex from a pair of vertices. corollary let g be a graph with a -separation, with i, j the two vertices separating the graph, and g, g the two graphs of the separation. let u v and v v . then fg =fg/ijt + fg/ijt + fgfg + fgfg fgfg fgfg + + fg)fg + fg + fg) fgfg lemma let i, j be vertices of a graph g. then t = fg. the following theorem is found in .

Additionally, a ""-switch"" operation can be performed to swap vertices in separated subgraphs without affecting certain properties. Further analysis involves counting spanning forests in various scenarios, and theorems and lemma provide formulas and proofs for these calculations."

"earlier work by the authors considered resistance distance in a straight linear -tree with n vertices and obtained the following result. theorem let hn be the straight linear -tree on n vertices labeled as in figure , and let m = n be the number of triangles in hn. then for any two vertices j and j + k of hn, rhn = f m+ + f k f mjk+ fm+ + fm+ fm+ where fp is the pth fibonacci number and lk is the kth lucas number. modifying this formula by replacing j by u, j + k by v, m by n , then multiplying by fn and applying theorem we have fhn = f n + f vuf nuv+ + fn [fn+uvlvu fvu) + fn+uvfvu+ + fvu]. in we also gave an alternative formula for rhn. modifying it in the same way yields fhn = vu x i= fniu+ although it is not a closed form expression, is is nevertheless useful as we shall see. in this work we consider a modication of the straight linear -tree which we term the bent linear -tree whose denition is below. denition . we dene the graph gn with v = v and e = {k, k + }) \ to be a bent linear -tree with bend at vertex k. see figure in essence a bent linear tree diers from a straight linear tree in that vertex k has degree , vertex k + has degree and all other vertices have

vertices and single bend at vertex k. theorem let gn be the bent linear -tree on n vertices labeled as in figure with a bend located at vertex k and let hn be the straight linear -tree on n vertices labeled as in figure then for any two vertices u and v of gn, where u < v k+ or k+ < u < v n fgn = fhn and rgn = rhn, where fhn is given by equation . for all other u and v in v the number of spanning -trees and resistance distances are determined as follows. theorem let gn be a bent linear -tree on n vertices with a single bend at vertex k. then for any two vertices u and v with u k + and v > k + , fgn = fhn [fkfk+ + kuf u] [fnkfnk+ + vkf nv], while the resistance distance between u and v is given by rgn = rhn [fkfk+ + kuf u] [fnkfnk+ + vkf nv]/fn proof. let h be the straight linear -tree with n vertices and denote gn by g. we note that both g and h are graphs with a -separation {k, k + }. moreover g is obtained by performing a -switch on the vertices k and k + in h. from theorem we observe that fg =fg/ijt + fg/ijt + fgfg + fgfg fgfg, where i = k, j = k+ and g and g are the two graphs of the -separation of g as shown in figure k k + k n n k + figure : the two graphs of the -separation of

that i = k and j = k + , we have fg = fh fhfh fhfh + fgfg + fgfg we note that fg = fh, fg = fh, fg = fh and fg = fh making these substitutions, fg = fh fhfh fhfh + fhfh + fhfh = fh + recalling that h has k + vertices, we let n = k + in equation . then applying it twice, once with v = k + and once with v = k we obtain fh fh = fk+ufk+u fkufk+u. by catalans identity, fk+ufk+u = f k + kuf u and fkufk+u = f k + ku+f u substituting in the previous equation and simplifying, we have fh fh = fkfk+ + kuf u it remains to deal with the term fh fh in order to apply equation we must rst adjust the vertex labels on h let r be the graph obtained from h by labeling the vertices from the right beginning with n k n k + figure : the graph r obtained by reordering the vertices of h by symmetry fh = fr

"in this paper we have given a non-trivial generalization of well-known and elementary formulae for calculating the number of spanning trees of a graph g and the number of separating -forests separating vertices in the case that g contains a cut-vertex, to the case in which g contains a -separator. we have applied these formulae to the sierpinski triangle and to a family of linear -trees with a single bend. for the sierpinski triangle we observed that for any of the degree vertices a and b, the resistance distance rn as n . for the bent linear -tree we determined the resistance distance (or number of spanning -forests) between any pair of vertices. we found that if two vertices are strictly on one side of a -separator associated with the bend, then the resistance distances in the bent -tree match the corresponding resistance distances in the straight linear -tree on the same number of vertices, while if the two vertices are on opposite sides of this -separator, all the resistance distances in the bent -tree are less than the corresponding resistance distances in the straight linear -tree. nevertheless, it is straightforward to check that rgn as n if gn is any member of the family of linear -trees with a single bend as is the case with the straight linear -tree . these two examples illustrate the power of these -separation formulae, and we are con- dent that they can be applied to many other families of graphs in which standard circuit rules or combinatorial arguments (to count separating spanning -forests) are dicult, tedious, or even impossible to apply. finding analogous formulae for -connected graphs is an interesting but dicult, open question. references r. b. bapat. resistance distance in graphs. math. student, :, r. b. bapat and somit gupta. resistance distance in wheels and fans. indian journal of pure and applied mathematics, :, feb r.b. bapat. graphs and matrices. universitext. springer london, wayne barrett, emily. j. evans, and amanda e. francis. resistance distance in straight linear -trees. discrete appl. math., :, b ela bollob as. modern graph theory, volume of graduate texts in mathematics. springer-verlag, new york, andries e. brouwer and willem h. haemers. spectra of graphs. universitext. springer, new york, seth chaiken. a combinatorial proof of the all minors matrix tree theorem. siam j. algebraic discrete methods, :, shu-chiuan chang, lung-chi chen, and wei-shih yang. spanning trees on the sier- pinski gasket. j. stat. phys., :, haiyan chen and fuji zhang. resistance distance and the normalized laplacian spectrum. discrete appl. math., :, peter g. doyle and j. laurie snell. random walks and electric networks, volume of carus mathematical monographs. mathematical association of america, washington, dc, d. j. klein and m. randi c. resistance distance. journal of mathematical chemistry, :, dec l. lov asz. random walks on graphs: a survey. in combinatorics, paul erd os is eighty, vol. , volume of bolyai soc. math. stud., pages j anos bolyai math. soc., budapest, daniel a. spielman and nikhil srivastava. graph sparsication by eective resistances. siam j. comput., :, william stevenson. elements of power system analysis. mcgraw hill, new york, edition, carsten thomassen. whitneys -switching theorem, cycle spaces, and arc mappings of directed graphs. j. combin. theory ser. b, :, yujun yang and douglas j. klein. a recursion formula for resistance distances and its applications. discrete appl. math., :, november","The paper presents generalizations of well-known formulas for calculating the number of spanning trees and separating -forests in graphs, with a focus on graphs containing -separators.

models for image recognition. later, researchers have found that they can add noise into original examples to generate adversarial examples for improving the robustness of a dnn model or attacking a dnn model. goodfellow et al. proposed a framework to estimate generative models via an adversarial process, and many variants have been proposed. they are called generative adversarial networks , which is a popular way to generate adversarial examples. zhang et al. proposed an unsupervised framework to generate semantic-equivalent adversarial examples, which are used to test the consistency of autonomous driving systems across different scenes. tian et al. proposed deeptest, which can generate realistic synthetic images by applying image transformations, scale, shear and rotation on original images. akhtari et al. have investigated other adversarial attacks , , , , , . to generate an effective adversarial example, it needs to generate a lot of noises for adding to the original examples before they succeed obtaining an effective adversarial example. the number of noises to generate an adversarial example can be enormous. moreover adversarial examples with too much noise can be easily detected by a defense model. for example, akhtar et al. proposed a defense framework against the adversarial attacks generated using universal perturbations . in practice, we observe that different original examples can have different noise sensitivity. examples with high noise sensitivity are more likely to become adversarial examples by perturbations. to increase the proportion of effective ad- versarial examples in all adversarial examples, high noise- sensitive example should be picked out, which are added noise to generate adversarial examples. in this paper, we propose a noise-sensitivity-analysis-based test prioritization technique to detect high noise-sensitive examples in dnn models with probability labels. first, nsatp collects the probability vectors of original examples in deep neural net- work. then, nsatp uses the distance of the probability vec- tors to compute the noise-sensitive values of original examples. finally, nsatp ranks the original examples according to their noise-sensitive values. we use three types of distances in this in this paper, adversarial example refers to the example, which is generated by adding noise to original example, and effective adversarial example refers to the adversarial example, which can fool the deep neural network arxiv:v jan paper, namely probability difference, probability entropy and probability-variance. we construct an experiment to validate the effectiveness of nsatp on four image datesets and two deep neural network models. the experimental results show the example is sensitive to noise, the higher noise sensitivity of an example is, the more nsatp it is likely to generate an adversarial example with it, and the results based on probability difference is more effective than that based on probability entropy and probability variance. the main contribution of our work is fourfold. first, we conrmed that the example is sensitive to noise, and adding the same noise, high noise-sensitive examples are easier to fool the deep neural network than low noise-sensitive ex- amples with the same noise. second, we proposed a noise- sensitivity-analysis-based test prioritization technique, which can effectively pick out the examples by their noise sensitivity. third, we conducted an experiment on four image datasets and two deep neural network models to validate the effectiveness of nsatp. fourth, probability-difference distance is more effective than probability-entropy distance and probability- variance distance. the rest of the paper is organized as follows. section ii uses the observations on two images to show that the example may be sensitive to noise and motivate our work. section iii presents our approach in detail, which is evaluated in section iv. then we introduce related work in section v. finally, we conclude our work in section vi.","Deep learning, particularly utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs), has become widely employed in various fields including genetics, medicine, finance, and more. While DNNs have shown remarkable success in tasks such as speech and image recognition, they heavily rely on the dataset they are trained on. This dependence on training data can lead to errors in classifying new samples. Adversarial examples, where DNNs fail to correctly classify an example, have been explored to understand and improve the robustness of DNN models. Researchers have developed techniques such as generative adversarial networks and unsupervised frameworks to generate adversarial examples for testing system consistency. A noise-sensitivity-analysis-based test prioritization technique has been proposed to detect high noise-sensitive examples in DNN models using probability labels. Experimental validation on image datasets and DNN models demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique in identifying noise-sensitive examples. The study confirmed that examples with high noise sensitivity are more likely to produce effective adversarial examples and highlighted the importance of understanding noise sensitivity in DNN models."
"in this section, we rst present adversarial attacks. based on it, we discuss the observation on two image to motivate our work. a. adversarial attacks and defenses deep neural networks are mainly driven by models and data, which are used to solve some challenging tasks. related studies , , , show that deep neural networks still have vulnerabilities, which can be fooled by adversarial examples. there are some common ways to generate adver- sarial examples, such as adding noise into original examples and example transformation. the existence of adversarial examples has been pointed out by szegedy et al. . given an trained model c, an valid input x and the target t, some noise are added into x to generate an valid input x, of which the target are the same as that of x, but c = c. this example x is known as an effective adversarial example. the distance metric is used to quantify similarity between x and x. one main goal of related algorithms , , , is to generate an adversarial example x with a small distance from x. since the discovery of adversarial examples for the deep neural networks , many works focus on the robustness of neural networks against these adversarial examples and show that using adversarial examples as training can improve the robustness of neural networks. akhtar et al. proposed a defense framework appending a pre-input layers against the adversarial attacks. adversarial examples with too much noise are easily identied by defense mechanism. there are some defense mechanism that limit the number of attacks, such as alipays face authentications. label: label label: label fig. : two original images b. observation label: orig. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. fig. : adversarial examples of fig. label: orig. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. label: adver. fig. : adversarial examples of fig. convolutional neural networks are a special kind of multi- layer neural networks, which are trained with a version of the back-propagation algorithm. lenet is one convolutional network designed for handwritten and machine-printed char- acter recognition. we use mnist to train lenet- model, and randomly choose two pictures showed in fig. lenet- outputs that the probability vectors of the two pictures are , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , respectively. we randomly choose pixels and reverse the value of each pixel in each picture. we repeat it to generate adversarial step step step step rank evaluate ranked s map attack model step our method pre-step adversarial examples step fig. : workow of our method examples for each pictures. there are and effective adversarial examples with respect to the two pictures of fig. , showed in fig. and fig. we have the observation that the number of effective adversarial examples with respect to fig. is bigger than that with respect to fig. . we repeat times to observe the difference between the numbers of effective adversarial examples with respect to fig. and fig. , and we nd the numbers of effective adversarial examples with respect to fig. is always not less than that with respect to fig. . we further observe the probability vectors of the two pictures, and the probability values of each label of fig. are more discretized than that of fig. . for example, the probability vector variance of fig. is more than that of fig. , and the probability difference of fig. between st probability and nd probability is more than that of fig. . the observation shows that the examples are sensitive to noise, which motivates us to consider whether the noise sensitivity is related to probability vectors, and whether probability vectors can be used to evaluate the noise sensitivity of given examples.","The section introduces adversarial attacks on deep neural networks and discusses the vulnerabilities that exist, leading to the generation of adversarial examples. These examples can fool deep neural networks and are typically created by adding noise to original inputs. Various defense mechanisms have been proposed to improve the robustness of neural networks against such attacks, including appending pre-input layers and using adversarial examples for training. The text also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks, particularly Lenet, for image recognition tasks. An experiment is described where adversarial examples are generated by manipulating pixel values in images, and it is observed that certain images are more sensitive to noise than others based on the probability vectors generated by the neural network. This observation prompts further exploration into the relationship between probability vectors and noise sensitivity in images."
"in this section, we present our method nsatp to compute the noise sensitivity of each examples and rank examples by their noise sensitivity. our method is designed for choosing the original examples before generating adversarial examples based on original examples to attack deep neural networks or improve the robustness of deep neural networks. a. problem settings a neural network can be seen as a function f = y, where x denotes the input and y denotes the output (x r and y r). in this paper we focus on deep neural networks with the capabilities of n-class classication. the networks use the softmax function to compute the output of the network, and the output vector p satises pi and pi=n i= pi = let us consider a train set ts and a deep neural network models c, of which the outputs are the probability labels. all examples of ts can be used to train the model c to generate a trained a trained model c with n probability vectors. for a valid input example ti ts, the trained model c can output the probability vector of ti, i.e., p i , p i , . . . , pn i . suppose that there is a example set s , which is used to generate adversarial examples, and the method af of adding noise to s is available. for a ex- ample si s, af can generate k examples (i.e., s i , s i , . . . , sk i ), which are used to attack the trained model c or improve the robustness of the trained model c b. our method nsatp since our method is to evaluate the noise sensitivity of each example in s based on their probability vectors computed by the trained model c, the probability vectors of evaluated examples should be available. our method workow is depicted in fig. previous related works , , focused on how to generate effective adversarial examples based on one given example, but example may be sensitive to noise. adding too much noise to low noise-sensitive example to generate effec- tive adversarial examples may make the adversarial example meaningless or be easily detected by the defense mechanism. nsatp aims to assess the noise sensitivity of examples and pick out the high noise-sensitive examples before attack models generate adversarial examples. to start such a process, we assume that a trained models c is ready showed in pre-step of fig. , and the examples s is also ready before applying nsatp. nsatp four steps, as illustrated in the fig. step : input s into c to collect the probability vectors of each si s; step : use a distance metric to evaluate the probability vectors of each si; step : generate a ranking list based on the results of step ; step : map the ranking list of step and s to generate the ranked example list based on s. previous related works , , focused on the step of fig. , which randomly selected examples from s and ignored the noise sensitivity of examples in s. then, they used the generated adversarial examples to attack c or improve the robustness of c pd = i=n x i= i pv = i=n x i= pe = i=n x i= pi log pi the selection of distance metrics is crucial to our method. based on the observation in section ii-b, the distance metric is evaluated the noise sensitivity of one example based on the difference between the probability vectors of the example. suppose we are given one probability vector p, p, . . . , pn, we use probability difference , probability variance and probability entropy to compute the noise sensitivity, respectively. the probability difference is the sum of the differ- ences between different sorting levels with different weights. we rst rank each value of the given probability vector to gen- erate a ranked vector p, p, . . . , pnby descending order, then compute the difference between two adjacent numbers of the ranked vector and mark the weight from to n, nally calculate the sum of all difference with their weights. the pd calculation is given in equation the variance is used to measure the dispersion of one given data set. we use the variance metric to measure the dispersion between values in one given probability vector. the pv calculation is given in equation entropy can be used to evaluate the uncertainty of random variables, and the probability values of the example can be seen as random variables. in this paper we call it probability entropy. the pe calculation is given in equation","The method presented in this section, known as nsatp, computes the noise sensitivity of examples and ranks them accordingly. It is designed to select original examples before generating adversarial examples to attack or improve the robustness of deep neural networks. The method focuses on deep neural networks for n-class classification using the softmax function to compute outputs. It involves training a model on a training set and then evaluating examples for noise sensitivity to choose high noise-sensitive examples for generating adversarial examples. The method consists of four steps: inputting examples into the model, evaluating probability vectors using a distance metric, generating a ranking list, and mapping the list to rank examples. Distance metrics like probability difference, variance, and entropy are used to assess noise sensitivity based on differences in probability vectors. These metrics help in selecting examples strategically to improve the effectiveness of adversarial attacks."
"in this section, we rst describe set the experiment and train the models on which we evaluate our method. then, we introduce some metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. finally, we present the data analysis and the results of the experiment. a. research questions regarding our obversactions in section ii and our proposal, we are desired to answer the following questions. q : whether are examples sensitive to noise, and is there a relationship between noise sensitivity and probability vectors? q : if q is yes, is our method effective to analyze the noise sensitivity of examples than the standard random manner? q : if q is yes, which distance is better to evaluate the the noise sensitivity of examples? b. experimental setup similar to su et al. , we encode the perturbation into an array which is optimized by differential evolution. in our experiment each perturbation holds x-y coordinates and rgb value of the perturbation, and one perturbation modies four pixels. we train two network models on mnist, fashion-mnist , cifar- and cifar- classica- tion tasks, respectively. the model architecture is given in table i and the hyperparameters selected in table ii. in our paper, we use the all training sets of the four datasets to traning dnn models, and use the test sets of the four datasets to analyze the noise sensitivity of examples and answer the research questions. c. performance measurement in this section, we will introduce some metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of nsatp. ) effective adversarial sample ratio : evaluating the effectiveness of adversarial examples is an important way to compare the effectiveness of different adversarial attack techniques. the more the effectiveness of adversarial examples is, the less cost it is to successfully attack dnns. in this paper, to measure the noise-sensitivity of examples, we compute how many adversarial samples fool the given deep neural network among given adversarial sample set. for example, given an example s and a deep neural network, an attack model generate m adversarial samples, of which n samples can fool the given deep neural network, and the nosie-senstivity of s is n m. ) f-measure: f-measure is widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods in adaptive testing and security testing. f-measure denotes how many test cases are executed before successfully attacking the system. to measure performance the advantages in effectiveness of nsatp to random, we follow , to use the f-measure metric. f- measure calculates the expected number of adversarial sample required to successfully fool the given deep neural network. in other words, a lower f-measure value means that fewer adversarial samples are used to accomplish the task. if an attack strategy yields a lower f-measure value, it is considered to be more effective. we expect a lower f-measure value for nsatp than that of random. we thus calculate inc. = ra r % to evaluate the effectiveness improvement, where r and a stand for the effectiveness of random and nsatp in f-measure, respectively. the greater the value is, the more effective nsatp is than random. ) effectiveness on distance metric: in our frame- work, it can use any distance metric, which can be used to evaluate the probability vectors. in this paper, we use three different distance metrics to compute the noise sensitivity of given examples. to evaluate the effectiveness of different ranks, we can t their curve functions and map them to linear functions, then use the absolute derivative of linear functions to evaluate the effectiveness of different ranks. first, for a given distance metric, we use our framework to obtain a tuple v, efor an given example, where v denotes the distance table i: model architectures net- net- layer type mnist f-mnist cifar- cifar- mnist f-mnist cifar- cifar- convolution + relu max pooling convolution + relu convolution + relu -

( ra r %) metric to calculate the improvements from random to artsqli, and report inc.= %. we check all inc. values of v and obtain they are range from % to %, which shows nsatp is more effective than random. finally, we answer q as follows: the eff. values of all examples are more than zero. a: our method can effectively analyze the noise sensitivity of examples, and the tted curves based on the results of three distance metrics are all exponential function on each image dataset and each model. table vi: map the curve function to the linear function net- lenet- pd pe pv pd pe pv mnist abs. mark best worst middle best worst middle f-mnist abs. mark best worst middle best worst middle cifar- abs. mark worst best middle best worst middle cifar- abs. mark worst best middle best worst middle ) answer q: to answer q, we use eff-d metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the three distance metrics. let us take the rst cell of table iii to illustrate the evalua- tion process. we dene a function z = ln y, and we use vari- able substitution to obtain the function z = x + ln . we further compute the absolute derivative of z versus x, which is . we map each function of table iii to a linear function and compute the absolute derivative of the linear function, summarized in table vi. we compare the absolute derivatives on one model and one dataset among three distance metric, and mark the absolute derivative is maximum, middle, minimum as best, middle and worst, respectively. we nd that the probability difference has best, middle and worst, the probability entropy has best, middle and worst, and the probability variance has best, middle and worst, which denotes that the probability difference is better the other two metrics to evaluate the noise sensitivity of examples in general. finally, we answer q as follows: a: the probability difference metric is better than the other two metrics on each image dataset and each model. e. threats to validity in this section, we discuss the threats to validity of our experiment. in our experiment, we train two dnn models on four image datasets, and one perturbation modies four pixels. different perturbation may lead to different observations. the perturbation strategy just modies four pixels, but other pertur- bation strategies are likely to modify more than four pixels. the examples with too many noise may be easily detected by adversarial defense mechanism. moreover, we randomly choose the pixels of given examples and modify them. to enhance the observations and results, we repeat the experiment for times, and their conclusions are consistent. different models may have different accuracy rates with different training strategies, and different trained models may affect the effectiveness of our method. in our experiment, we construct two different models and different training strategies. the results based on these models and training strategies are consistent.","The section evaluates the effectiveness of the method by conducting experiments on two DNN models trained on four image datasets. The experiment analyzes noise sensitivity of examples through various metrics and evaluates the method against standard random approaches. Results indicate an exponential relationship between noise sensitivity and probability vectors, with the probability difference metric identified as the most effective in evaluating noise sensitivity. The method shows improvement over random testing in revealing adversarial attacks, as evidenced by a lower F-measure. Consistent results are obtained across multiple experiments, while potential threats to validity are discussed, such as variations in perturbation and model accuracy."

and exploit a minimal kernel-based convolution to achieve better inpainting eects. in the general computer vision community, various inpaint- ing techniques have been proposed to remove objects, texts or scratches from images using the remaining information in the image. examples include an onion-peel strategy that lls regions of interest from an outermost to innermost concentric ring with reference to available patches ; an exemplar-based method that lls specic regions by directly copying simi- lar patches extracted from the whole image; and synthesis of roi intensities with textures from matched patches by applying a non-local means algorithm . advances in deep learning have signicantly enhanced inpainting ef- fects. initial deep learning based inpainting frameworks, in which networks are trained to ll roi contents based on its surroundings, have been described by a number of groups . these techniques suer from both pixel-wise reconstruction loss and adversarial loss, and tend to generate artifacts between inpainted and neighbourhood areas. the addition of more convolutions, which integrates distant areas into inpainting algorithms, has been applied to mitigate the appearance discrepancies introduced by deep learning; and further optimization undertaken to minimize the dierence between lled regions and their neighbourhood. however, increasing convolutional layers and apply- ing optimization are computationally intensive and are substantially more time consuming. liu et al. have recently described a model that uses so-called partial convolutions. unlike traditional convolutional layers, which mask the convolu- tion and thus perform convolution operations only on non-missing pixels, this method achieves remarkable inpainting eects by incorporating vgg- figure : network architecture. the network takes both the t brain image and associated lesion mask as inputs, and then outputs inpainted results. in the training stage, the lesion areas are randomly synthesized to generate training masks. two non-local blocks are inserted after pconv and pconv, respectively. based features into loss function . based on the superiority of deep learning based techniques for inpainting of non-medical color images, we explore ms le- sion inpainting under this framework . unlike arbitrary objects, which are morphologically heterogeneous, the human brain consists of dened, repro- ducible structures such as wm, gm and csf. more specically, ordinary images may contain arbitrary object types, such as scenery, faces, furniture that do not necessarily have uniform structure or properties. therefore, when designing deep learning frameworks for image roi inpainting, very few assumptions can be made. by contrast, the relative uniformity of brain structure and appearance among individuals permits the integration of a deep learning framework with a non-local module to facilitate brain lesion inpainting. the non-local module links one brain voxel with spatially long range brain voxels. hence, the response of one voxel is a weighted sum of the features from all relevant local and distant voxels. by modeling long range dependencies, the algorithm is able to inpaint lesion areas with reference to the whole brain area rather than only the local neighbourhood. therefore, we propose a model with the following distinguishing features: ) the model does not make any assumption that the lesion area is/should be lled with white matter like intensity; ) the model integrates global brain information based on the consistency of brain structure, rather than using neighbourhood texture as the key factor to determine the lled intensity; ) when a lesion mask that erroneously overlaps with normal tissues (such as csf) is supplied as an input, our algorithm is able to inpaint the lesion roi with appropriately disposed normal tissue intensities. in other words, the algorithm is able to maintain normal tissue architecture rather than simply lling lesion masks rois with white matter like intensity. synthetic lesions can be generated by non-linear co-registration of real flair image derived ms lesion masks with healthy subject mri t images to validate the technique and provide a ready- made ground truth for comparative experiments. herein, we demonstrate the eectiveness and eciency of ms lesion inpainting using these methods.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that causes damage to the central nervous system, leading to brain atrophy and disability. Monitoring disease progression using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is essential, but misclassification of lesions can bias volume measurements. Current methods of lesion inpainting aim to fill lesions with normal white matter-like intensities. However, recent advancements propose more sophisticated approaches, such as blending white and grey matter intensities based on lesion locations. Deep learning techniques have been applied to improve inpainting effects, with the use of partial convolutions showing promising results. A proposed model integrates global brain information to inpaint lesions with appropriate intensities, rather than assuming white matter-like fillings. This model can maintain normal tissue architecture and has shown effectiveness in MS lesion inpainting."
"our proposed inpainting model is stacked by partial convolutions and simul- taneously integrates several non-local blocks. we rst explain concepts of partial convolution and non-local block, and then introduce network architecture and implementation.","The proposed inpainting model integrates partial convolutions and non-local blocks, aiming to improve the inpainting process. The model architecture incorporates these elements, combining them to enhance performance."
"in general, the partial convolution operation proposed by liu et al. consists of two parts: a partial convolutional layer and mask updating. suppose x refers to the feature values or intensity of the mri slice, m is the binary mask representing zero and one as lesion and normal brain tissue areas, respectively. the partial convolution is dened as: x = ( w t sum sum + b, if sum > , otherwise , where w and b are convolutional weights and bias respectively. meanwhile, has the same size as m and are lled with all ones. by taking mask m into account, the output of the partial convolution only relies on unmasked values. concurrently, mask m is updated as follows: m = ( , if sum > , otherwise . here, x and m are the updated feature map and updated mask from the partial convolution layer, respectively.","The partial convolution operation proposed by Liu et al. includes a partial convolutional layer and mask updating. It involves feature values (x) and a binary mask (m) representing lesion and normal brain tissue areas. The partial convolution is defined as x = ( w t sum sum + b, if sum > , otherwise , where w and b are convolutional weights and bias. The output of the partial convolution depends only on unmasked values due to the inclusion of mask m. The mask is updated based on the condition sum > . The resulting updated feature map is denoted by x, while the updated mask is denoted by m."
"traditional convolution operations focus on the cues within the roi neigh- bourhood and thus ignore global information. even with a large receptive eld, convolution operations are still based on local information. in contrast, the non-local module aims to perform inpainting by taking long distance cues into consideration. more specically, given a specic location within brain slice, the non-local module will compute the responses between this location and its counterparts within the whole image, exploiting the relative homogeneity and internal correlation of brain structure. given feature maps x rcn from a partial convolution layer, the non- local block then transforms x into three feature spaces f, g and h, where f = wfx,g = wgx and h = whx. here, wf, wg and wh are weight matrices to be learned and such linear operations can be implemented as convolutions. the self-attention module subsequently requires f and g for attention map calculation. more specically, the attention map can be obtained by: aji = softmaxt g), figure : the attention maps of color coded queries. top row: brain slices with query locations bottom row: attention maps of red, green and blue dot queries are shown from left to right for each image red dot: query on white matter or thalamus green dot: query on grey matter blue dot: query on background. here, the size of attention map is , while the size of testing slice is note that the whitest regions in the grayscale attention map are best correlated to the queries and vice versa. despite diering resolution between the attention map and testing slice, the whitest regions within attention maps are appropriately located in regions that correspond to the respective queries. the attended areas all are within the global domain rather than a local region. here, aji is namely the softmax operation along the dimension j. evidently, the softmax operation here measures the similarity between ith and jth locations in x. the self-attention form is nally expressed as: s = ah. this is to say that the self-attention module computes a response at a lo- cation by attending all positions and taking their weighted average in an em- bedding space. subsequently, the self-attention module is incorporated into the non-local block as: y = wss + x, where y refers to the non-local block and ws is the weight matrix of the convolution to be learned. initially, ws is set as zero and thus y is exactly x, which means that the inpainting task only relies on neighbourhood cues initially. after gradually updating ws, more non-local evidence is considered in the training and future inpainting. in our model, the non-local block is integrated with a partial convolution layer. as shown in the rst row of fig. , the red, green, blue dots represent query locations within the white matter, grey matter and background respectively. in the second row, the corresponding attention maps of the color coded query dots are displayed. note that the size of each attention map here is (see section for further details), while the size of input mri slice is meanwhile, the most-attended regions are the whitest areas in the attention map and vice versa. though the size of the attention map and input slice are discrepant, the attended area approximates its expected anatomic counterpart. for example, figure : eect of the non-local module on lesion inpainting. ms data. lesion mask generated using a semi-automated thresholdhing technique by an expert neuroimaging analyst using coregistered flair images. inpainting results without and with non- local module. lesion inpainting is aected by proximity to the lateral ventricles without the non-local module. in contrast, lesion-lling results in this region are cleaner and more realistic with the non-local module. attended regions for grey matter queries are generally located at the periphery of the brain in areas that approximate the location of the cortex; and attended regions for background queries are consistently located outside the brain area in attention maps. moreover, fig. illustrates the inpainitng eects with and without the non-local module.","The non-local block in the presented model aims to incorporate long-distance cues for inpainting tasks by considering global information within the entire image. This is achieved by transforming feature maps into three spaces and calculating attention maps based on learned weight matrices. The self-attention module computes responses by attending to all positions and taking their weighted average. By gradually updating weights, the model incorporates more non-local evidence for improved inpainting results. The integration of the non-local block with a partial convolution layer enhances lesion inpainting accuracy, especially near complex brain structures like the lateral ventricles. This approach results in cleaner and more realistic inpainting outcomes compared to traditional methods that rely solely on local information."
"our network is based on the architecture described by liu et al. (table ), and exploits partial convolutional layers to stack the network rather than traditional convolutional layers. both the encoder and decoder in the network has layers. the feature maps and binary masks from the encoder stage are concatenated by skip links into the decoder stage. furthermore, the size of the binary mask is exactly matched with the respective input brain slice and will be updated in the following encoder and decoder stages. the values of weight matrix and bias for the binary mask are initially set as and respectively, and kept xed during training. likewise, the values of weight matrices and bias for f, g and h are initially set as and , respectively, but only bias is xed during training. however, the integration of a non-local module into the network is compu- tationally intensive. in order to facilitate computational eciency, the number of channels with feature spaces f, g and h is therefore reduced to half of the number of channels of x in our method. meanwhile, in eq. the number of chan- nels of s can be increased with ws so as to match the number of channels of x. additionally, a max pooling layer is applied after g and h to speed computation. in our case, the stride of max pooling layer is in the experimental work presented, the following principals are applied with respect to the integration of non-local blocks: non-local blocks should be inserted in the decoder stage, where they are closer to the output of the network. the more non-local blocks embedded within the network, the more accu- rate the inpainting eects are. based on eq. , it is optimal to insert two non-local blocks directly after pconv and pconv, respectively. though some techniques are applied to speed up computation, the maximum number of added non-local blocks is pconv is physically the closest layer to the output layer but this layers feature maps are relatively larger than those relating to pconv and pconv therefore, computational eciency is improved by not inserting a non-local block after pconv, while not sacricing model accuracy at same time. the training set contains approximately slices; the initial learning rate is set as and the batch size as the learning rate for ne-tuning is set as . there are approximately and epochs for training and ne-tuning respectively.","The network design and implementation discussed in the section is based on an architecture proposed by Liu et al. It utilizes partial convolutional layers for stacking the network instead of traditional convolutional layers. The encoder and decoder each have a specific number of layers, with feature maps and binary masks from the encoder being concatenated into the decoder using skip links. The binary mask size matches the input brain slice and is updated in subsequent stages. The values for weight matrix and bias are set initially and kept fixed during training. Non-local modules are integrated but to improve computational efficiency, the number of channels for certain feature spaces is reduced. Non-local blocks are inserted in the decoder stage for better inpainting effects, with the optimal placement being after specific layers. The training set consists of approximately slices, with specified learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs for training and fine-tuning."
"the output of the above network ioutput is fed into the following loss function for more accurate per-pixel reconstruction, where the loss function is dened according to liu et al. : ltotal = lvalid + lhole + lperceptual + lstyle + ltv, where lvalid and lhole are the loss terms aiming to enhance per-pixel recon- struction accuracy of the whole brain slice including any inpainted region. the terms lvalid and lhole are dened as follows: lhole = nigt , lvalid = nigt m , where igt, m and nigt respectively represent ground truth slice, binary lesion mask and the number of voxels in the slice. partial convolution based network encoder decoder pconv concat pconv pconv concat pconv pconv concat pconv pconv concat pconv pconv concat pconv pconv concat pconv pconv concat pconv pconv concat pconv table : partial convolution based network. pconv: partial convolution layer concat: concatenate the previous nearest neighbour upsampled results with feature maps from corresponding pconv in encoder stage. two non-local blocks are inserted directly after pconv and pconv, respectively. in addition to the direct output for pixel wise reconstruction, lperceptual and lstyle are dened to ensure that the inpainted areas have a more realistic and natural texture and structure. the denition of lperceptual is as follows: lperceptual = p x p= iout p igt p n igt p + p x p= icomp p igt p n igt p . here, icomp is actually iout but with non-lesion area set to ground truth. n igt p is the number of elements in igt p . the inclusion of lperceptual accepts feature vectors by projecting iout, igt and icomp into a high level feature space i p with a pretrained vgg- network. the layers pool, pool, pool in vgg- are utilized for feature extraction in our work. furthermore, since the vgg- network requires an image of at least , all brain slices in our model are padded to size for training and testing. the d median lter is applied to alleviate minor inconsistency between slices. similarly, the loss term lstyle is dened as: lstyleout = p x p= cpcp kp((iout p )t (iout p ) (igt p )t (igt p )), lstylecomp = p x p= cpcp kp((icomp p )t (icomp p ) (igt p )t (igt p )), where the high level features i p is of shape cp (hp,wp,cp are height, width and channel number of slice i), resulting in a cp cp gram matrix, and kp is the normalization factor /cphpwp. lastly, ltv represents the total variation term for smoothing penalty. ltv = x r,r ii,j+ comp ii,j comp nicomp + x r,r ii+,j comp ii,j comp nicomp , where r denotes the region of pixel dilation of the lesion area. nicomp is the number of voxels in icomp. we adopt the same hyperparameter values of loss term weights as described by liu et al. .","The section describes the loss function used in a neural network for per-pixel reconstruction, involving terms like lvalid and lhole to enhance accuracy. The function also includes terms like lperceptual and lstyle to ensure realistic texture and structure in inpainted areas. Partial convolution networks with concatenation and non-local blocks are used, along with VGG-network features for high-level projection. The loss function also includes a smoothing penalty term (ltv) for total variation."
"three dierent mri datasets were used in training and testing stages. ixi dataset: a publically available collection of mr images from normal, healthy subjects . the ixi data was acquired on three dierent mri scanners (philips t system, philips t system, ge t system). the acquisition protocol for each subject includes the following sequences: t, t, proton density , and diusion- weighted images . here, we use only t images, but our method can be applied to other mri sequences. brain volumes were randomly selected for training and testing . all brain volumes were intensity nor- malized with mean and variance before training and testing. synthetic lesions, generated by non-linear co-registration with ms lesion masks , were applied to the selected testing volumes and regarded as ground truth for subsequent evaluation. the second dataset consists of mri scans from patients with relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis . t-weighted sequences were acquired on a t ge discovery mr scanner with the following parameters: fov mm, slice thickness mm, te ms, tr ms, flip angle , pixel spacing mm. acquisition matrix is , which results in mm isotropic acquisition voxel size. the reconstruc- tion matrix is this data, which has no ground truth, was utilized for demonstration in fig. , fig. and fig. the third dataset contains mri scans from patients with rrms and is primarily exploited for deriving lesions masks for subsequent generation of synthetic lesions on t images from the ixi healthy control testing dataset. sagittal flair cube sequences were acquired on a t ge dis- covery mr scanner with the follow- ing parameters: fov mm, slice thickness mm, te ms, tr ms, ti ms. acquisition matrix is additionally, pre- contrast axial t-weighted sequences were acquired with the fol- lowing parameters: fov mm, slice thickness mm, te ms, tr ms, ti ms, pixel spacing mm. acquisition matrix is , which results in mm isotropic acquisition voxel size. the reconstruction matrix is all lesion rois for ms cases were performed semiautomatically on flair images using jim by an experienced ms neuroimaging analyst. all datasets were acquired cross-sectionally and included both female and male subjects.","Three different MRI datasets were utilized in the training and testing phases.

These methods do not rely on lesion area information to generate inpainted voxels, with synthetic lesion masks having the lesion area values set as zeros before inpainting."
"in this experiment, white matter lesions masks derived from ms flair im- ages were used to create and inpaint synthetic lesions generated on non-linearly coregistered t images from healthy controls. since visible t hypointensi- ties are usually a subset of t hyperintensities, the flair-derived manually labelled lesion mask may involve isointense regions on matching ms t images. non-linear co-registration of ms lesion masks and healthy control t images is also likely to produce synthetic lesions that erroneously overlap with tissues other than white matter. synthetic lesions were generated on t brain images from healthy controls and inpainted with fsl, mmlf, pc and nlpc, respectively. inpainted images from all methods were visually in- spected and blindly rated by a neuroimaging expert based on similarity to the ground truth images. the nlpc method best approximated the ground truth in the majority of cases reviewed. in the remaining / lesion roi fsl pc mmlf nlpc figure : the sagittal and zoomed views of the t slice with embedded synthetic lesions. note the noisy samples generated by fsl and pc methods, the blurred boundaries obtained by mmlf method. cases, mmlf was chosen as the method that best approximated the ground truth. fig. , fig. and fig. provides examples of visual comparison of our inpainting method with existing methods.","White matter lesion masks from MS FLAIR images were used to create and inpaint synthetic lesions on healthy control T images.

"the proposed non-local partial convolutions lesion inpainting method, which exploits a non-local module under the framework of deep learning, demon- strated quantitative and qualitative superiority over the fsl inpainting tool, based on local intensity histogram information; mmlf, a state-of-the-art method in neuroimaging that lls lesions with the most plausible texture within a larger neighbourhood; and pc, the most recent deep learning based inpainting ap- proach in the computer vision eld. blinded qualitative assessment conrmed the superiority of our method for inpainting synthetic lesions embedded in healthy control data (ex- amples shown in figs. - ). the proposed method is therefore not aected by neighbouring structures; rather, it learns to ll local lesions by referring to global structures and texture information. as illustrated in figs. - , the inpainted results of other methods are more or less aected by neighbourhood, especially when the white matter lesion is close to either the ventricle or grey matter. quantitative analysis showed that the proposed method gen- erated the smallest mse and therefore the most realistic inpainting result of all four techniques. moreover, me and mae values show that the estimation of gm and wm volumes using sienax analysis of t brain volumes inpainted by our method are most accurate. during training, our method is inclined to focus on learning the feature characteristics of wm and gm. this is because csf takes up much smaller portion of brain compared to wm and gm. as a result, synthetic lesions that overlap csf may have a greater likelihood of being lled with white matter- like tissue intensities/texture, rather than csf. it is unlikely that grey matter tissue-like intensities will be generated by our model, since the non-local module will judge that csf regions to more closely approximate white matter than grey matter. as shown in gures and , fsl and pc tend to generate noisy samples. in terms of their texture, the noisy samples were potentially more likely to be classied as csf by comparison with the other methods. therefore, fsl and pc performed best in terms of csf volume estimation. however, the portion of the synthetic lesion mask that presents within the csf is extremely small and unlikely to inuence the gm, wm evaluation. the use of our model in real ms images, where the lesion mask will never overlap csf, also ameliorates this concern. our training data comprised brain images derived from healthy controls. brain atrophy rates in untreated patients with ms are signicantly higher than age-matched healthy controls. however, for the purpose of lesion inpainting in ms cases, the trained non-local attention globally searches within non-lesion areas by measuring feature and structural similarity between non-lesion and lesion areas. referencing the global non-lesion areas, our model subsequently lls lesion areas with healthy tissue-like textures. lesion inpainting using this method is therefore unaected by the presence or absence of brain volume loss.","The proposed non-local partial convolutions lesion inpainting method, utilizing a non-local module within deep learning, outperformed existing tools such as fsl inpainting, mmlf, and pc, both quantitatively and qualitatively. It demonstrated superiority in filling synthetic lesions in healthy control data by considering global structures and texture information, as opposed to being influenced by neighboring structures. The method generated the most realistic results with the smallest MSE and accurate estimations of grey matter and white matter volumes. The approach focuses on learning feature characteristics of white and grey matter, resulting in realistic inpainting without generating noisy textures. The method is effective in cases of brain atrophy and lesion inpainting in multiple sclerosis, unaffected by the presence or absence of brain volume loss."
"we propose a new deep learning model for realistic lesion inpainting in mri slices by exploiting the non-local module. rather than considering the neigh- bourhood texture for lesion lling, our method inpaints lesion areas with the most plausible intensities by observing the structure and texture information contained within the whole image. to achieve this, the non-local module com- pares similarities between the features within lesion regions and remaining brain areas. although some existing methods take into account non-local informa- tion, they are limited by algorithms that search for similar patches within a constrained bounding box, rather than the whole domain. as such, these meth- ods prove inferior to those described in this work. moreover, integrating the non-local module under the framework of deep learning generates an eective algorithm that outperforms traditional non-local based methods and can be incorporated into image analysis pipelines for more accurate quantitative as- sessment of brain substructure volumes. references references o. ganiler, a. oliver, y. diez, j. freixenet, j. vilanova, b. beltran, l. rami-torrent, a. rovira, x. llad, a subtraction

"discovering synonymous entities from a massive corpus is an indispensable task in automated knowledge discovery. for each entity, its synonyms refer to the entities that can be used interchangeably under certain contexts. for example, clogged nose and nasal congestion are synonyms relative to the context in which they are mentioned. given two entities, the synonym discovery task determines how likely these two entities are synonym with each other. the work done while at the university of illinois at chicago https://github.com/czhang/synonymnet main goal of synonym discovery is to learn a metric that dis- tinguishes synonym entities from non-synonym ones. the synonym discovery task is challenging to deal with for the following reasons. first of all, entities are ex- pressed with variations. for example, u.s.a/united states of america/united states/u.s. refer to the same idea but are expressed quite differently. recent works on synonym discovery focus on learning the similar- ity from entities and their character-level features [neculoiu et al., ; mueller and thyagarajan, ]. these meth- ods work well for synonyms that share a lot of character- level features like airplane/aeroplane or an entity and its abbreviation like acquired immune deficiency syndrome/aids. however, a large number of synonym en- tities in the real world do not share a lot of character-level features, such as jd/law degree, or clogged nose ex- pressed on social media vs. nasal congestion men- tioned in medical books. with only character-level features being used, these models hardly obtain the ability to discrim- inate entities that share similar semantics but are not alike verbatim. secondly, the nature of synonym discovery tasks in real-world scenarios makes it common yet more difcult un- der an open-world setting: new entities and synonyms emerge and need to be discovered from the text corpora. context information helps indicate entity synonymity. the distributional semantics theory hy- pothesizes that the meaning of an entity can be reected by its neighboring words in the text. current works achieve decent performance on entity similarity learning, but still suffer from the following issues: ) semantic structure. context, as a snippet of natural language sentence, is semantically struc- tured. some existing models encode the semantic structures in contexts implicitly during the entity representation learn- ing process [mikolov et al., ; pennington et al., ; peters et al., ]. the entity representations embody mean- ingful semantics: entities with similar contexts are likely to live in proximity in the embedding space. some other works explicitly incorporate structured annotations to model contexts. dependency parsing tree , user click information , or signed heteroge- neous graphs are introduced as the structured information to help discover synonyms. how- ever, structured annotations are time-consuming to obtain and may not even exist in an open-world setting. ) di- arxiv:v may verse contexts. a single entity can be mentioned in dif- ferent contexts, let alone the case for multiple synonymous entities. previous works on context-based synonym discovery either focus on entity information only [neculoiu et al., ; mueller and thyagarajan, ], or a single piece of context for each entity for context matching. notably, in specic domains such as medical, in- dividuals may provide different context in- formation when mentioning the same entity. thus. using a single piece of context may suffer from noises. incorporating multiple pieces of contexts explicitly for entity matching has the potential to improve both accuracy and robustness, which is less studied in existing works. moreover, it is not prac- tical to assume that multiple pieces of contexts are equally informative to represent the meaning of an entity: a context may contribute differently when being matched to different entities. thus it is imperative to focus on multiple pieces of contexts with a dynamic matching schema. in light of these challenges, we propose a framework to dis- cover synonym entities from a massive corpus without addi- tional structured annotations. a neural network model syn- onymnet is proposed to detect entity synonyms based on two given entities via a bilateral matching among multiple pieces of contexts in which each entity appears. a leaky unit is designed to explicitly alleviate the noises from uninforma- tive context during the matching process. we generate syn- onym entities that are completely unseen during training in the experiments. the contribution of this work is summarized as follows: we propose synonymnet, a context-aware bilateral matching model to detect entity synonyms. syn- onymnet generalizes the distributional hypothesis to multiple pieces of contexts. we introduce a synonym discovery framework that adopts synonymnet to obtain synonym entities from a free-text corpus without additional annotation. experiments are conducted with an open-world setting on generic and domain-specic datasets in english and chinese, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro- posed model for synonym discovery.","Automated knowledge discovery requires identifying synonymous entities from vast text collections. Entities with interchangeable meanings need to be distinguished accurately. Current methods often struggle with variations in how entities are expressed and the emergence of new entities and synonyms. Context plays a vital role in indicating entity synonymity, as the meaning of an entity is reflected by its surrounding words. Existing models for synonym discovery face challenges in encoding semantic structures and dealing with diverse contexts. To address these issues, a context-aware bilateral matching model called SynonymNet has been proposed. This neural network framework can efficiently detect entity synonyms by analyzing multiple contexts in which each entity appears. SynonymNet generalizes the distributional hypothesis to multiple pieces of context and is capable of discovering synonyms without additional annotations. Experimental results on both generic and domain-specific datasets in English and Chinese demonstrate the effectiveness of SynonymNet for synonym discovery in an open-world scenario."

"for each entity e, the context retriever randomly fetches p pieces of contexts from the corpus d in which the entity appears. we denote the retrieved contexts for e as a set c = {c, , cp }, where p is the number of context pieces. each piece of context cp c contains a sequence of words cp = p , , w p ), where t is the length of the context, which varies from one instance to another. w p is the t-th word in the p-th context retrieved for an entity e. - - + context encoder context retreiver bilateral matching with leaky unit context aggregation + loss ce ce ce ce ce ce ce ce clogged nose nasal congestion the predominant symptom of this condition is nasal congestion, which has a signicant impact . is condition , which nasal congestion ce clogged nose affects your ability to smell, breathe or may be a symptom of far worse infection leaky unit a nosebleed is the common occurrence of bleeding from the nose nosebleed weight sharing figure : overview of the proposed model synonymnet. the di- amonds are entities. each circle is associated with a piece of context in which an entity appears. synonymnet learns to minimize the loss calculated using multiple pieces of contexts via bilateral match- ing with leaky units.","The context retriever randomly selects p pieces of context from a corpus in which an entity appears, creating a set of retrieved contexts. Each context piece consists of a sequence of words, and the length of the context varies. The retrieved contexts are used in a model that involves bilateral matching with leaky units for context aggregation and loss calculation. An overview of the proposed model, SynonymNet, shows how entities are associated with context pieces and how the model aims to minimize loss using multiple contexts."
"for the p-th context cp, an encoder tries to learn a contin- uous vector that represents the context. for example, a re- current neural network such as a bidirectional lstm can be ap- plied to sequentially encode the context into hidden states: h p = lstmfw p , h p ), h p = lstmbw p , h p ), where w p is the word embedding vector used for the word w p . we introduce a simple encoder architecture that models contexts for synonym discovery, which learns to encode the local information around the entity from the raw context with- out utilizing additional structured annotations. it focuses on both forward and backward directions. however, the encod- ing process for each direction ceases immediately after it goes beyond the entity word in the context: hp = [ h p , h p ], where te is the index of the entity word e in the context and hp rdce. by doing this, the context encoder summa- rizes the context while explicitly considers the entitys loca- tion in the context. note that more advanced and sophisti- cated encoding methods can be used, such as elmo, bert, or xlnet. the encoder itself is not the main focus of this work.","The Context Encoder section discusses how an encoder learns a continuous vector to represent a context. It uses a bidirectional LSTM to encode the context into hidden states by focusing on local information around an entity without additional annotations. The encoder models both forward and backward directions but stops encoding after reaching the entity word. This summarization approach considers the entity's location in the context. While more advanced encoding methods like ELMo, BERT, or XLNet can be used, the encoder is not the primary focus of this work."
"considering the base case, where we want to identify whether or not two entities, say e and k, are synonyms with each other, we propose to nd the consensus information from multiple pieces of contexts via a bilateral matching schema. recall that for entity e, p pieces of contexts h = {h, h, , hp } are randomly fetched and encoded. and for entity k, we denote q pieces of contexts being fetched and encoded as g = {g, g, , gq}. instead of focusing on a single piece of context to determine entity synonymity, we adopt a bilat- eral matching between multiple pieces of encoded contexts for both accuracy and robustness. hg matching phrase: for each hp in h and gq in g, the matching score mpq is calculated as: mpq = exp(hpwbmgt q) p pp exp(hpwbmgt q), where wbm rdcedce is a bi-linear weight matrix. similarly, the hg matching phrase considers how much each context gq g could be useful to hp h: mpq = exp(gqwbmht p) p qq exp(gqwbmht p). note that p q matching needs to be conducted in total for each entity pair. we write the equations for each hp h and gq g for clarity. regarding the implementation, the bilateral matching can be easily written and effectively computed in a matrix form, where a matrix multiplication is used hwbmgt rp q where h rp dce and g rqdce. the matching score matrix m can be obtained by taking softmax on the hwbmgt matrix over certain axis . not all contexts are informative during the matching for two given entities. some contexts may contain intricate con- textual information even if they mention the entity explicitly. in this work, we introduce a leaky unit during the bilateral matching, so that uninformative contexts can be routed via the leaky unit rather than forced to be matched with any informa- tive contexts. the leaky unit is a dummy vector l rdce, where its representation can be either trained with the whole model for each task/dataset, or kept as a xed zero vector. we adopt the later design for simplicity. if we use the hg matching phrase as an example, the matching score from the leaky unit l to the q-th encoded context in gq is: mlq = exp(lwbmgt q) exp(lwbmgt q) + p pp exp(hpwbmgt q). if there is any uninformative context in h, say the p-th en- coded context, h p will contribute less when matched with gq due to the leaky effect: when h p is less informative than the leaky unit l. thus, the matching score between h p and gq is now calculated as follows: m pq = exp(h pwbmgt q) exp(lwbmgt q) + p pp exp(hpwbmgt q).","Entities e and k are assessed for synonymity by utilizing a bilateral matching approach that combines multiple pieces of context. Matching scores are calculated for each context pair, incorporating a bilinear weight matrix. To handle uninformative contexts, a leaky unit is introduced, allowing such contexts to be routed without affecting the overall matching process. The leaky unit, represented as a dummy vector, ensures that uninformative contexts do not interfere with the matching of more relevant information. Matrix operations simplify the computation of the matching scores, providing a robust and efficient method for determining entity synonymity using multiple context pieces."
"the informativeness of a context for an entity should not be a xed value: it heavily depends on the other entity and the other entitys contexts that we are comparing with. the bilat- eral matching scores indicate the matching among multiple pieces of encoded contexts for two entities. for each piece of encoded context, say gq for the entity k, we use the highest matched score with its counterpart as the relative informative- ness score of gq to k, denote as aq = max. here the intuition is that the informativeness of a piece of context for one entity is characterized by how much it can be matched with the most similar context for the other entity. we further aggregate multiple pieces of encoded contexts for each entity to a global context based on the relative informa- tiveness scores: for entity e: h = x pp aphp, for entity k: g = x qq aqgq. note that due to the leaky effect, less informative contexts are not forced to be heavily involved during the aggregation: the leaky unit may be more competitive than contexts that are less informative, thus having a larger matching score. how- ever, as the leaky unit and its matching score are not used for aggregation scores on informative contexts become more salient during context aggregation.","Context aggregation involves determining the informativeness of a context for an entity based on comparisons with other entities and their contexts. Bilateral matching scores are used to assess the matching among multiple encoded contexts for two entities. The highest matching score for each piece of encoded context is considered the relative informativeness score for that entity. Multiple encoded contexts are aggregated into a global context for each entity using these relative scores. Less informative contexts are not heavily involved in the aggregation process due to the leaky effect, which allows more competitive contexts to have a larger impact. This ensures that informative contexts are prioritized during context aggregation."
"we introduce two architectures for training the syn- onymnet: a siamese architecture and a triplet architecture. siamese architecture the siamese architecture takes two entities e and k, along with their contexts h and g as the in- put. the following loss function lsiamese is used in training for the siamese architecture : lsiamese = yl+ + l, where it contains losses for two cases: l+ when e and k are synonyms to each other , and l when e and k are not : l+ = ( s( h, g)), l = max(s( h, g) m, ), where s is a similarity function, e.g. cosine similarity, and m is the margin value. l+ decreases monotonically as the similarity score becomes higher within the range of . l+ = when s( h, g) = for l, it remains zero when s( h, g) is smaller than a margin m. otherwise l increases as s( h, g) becomes larger. triplet architecture the siamese loss makes the model as- sign rational pairs with absolute high scores and irrational ones with low scores, while the rationality of entity syn- onymity could be dynamic based on entities and contexts. the triplet architecture learns a metric such that the global context h of an entity e is relatively closer to a global context g+ of its synonym entity, say k+, than it is to the global con- text gof a negative example gby some margin value m. the following loss function ltriplet is used in training for the triplet architecture: ltriplet = max(s( h, g) s( h, g+) + m, ).",Two architectures are introduced for training the synonymnet: siamese and triplet architectures. The siamese architecture takes two entities with their contexts as input and uses a loss function that penalizes dissimilar pairs while rewarding similar pairs. The triplet architecture focuses on learning a metric where the global context of an entity is closer to its synonym's context than to a negative example by a margin value. The loss function for the triplet architecture emphasizes maximizing the distance between negative examples and positive pairs.
"the objective of the inference phase is to discover synonym entities for a given query entity from the corpus effectively. we utilize context-aware word representations to obtain can- didate entities that narrow down the search space. the syn- onymnet veries entity synonymity by assigning a syn- onym score for two entities based on multiple pieces of con- texts. the overall framework is described in figure query entity e corpus d entity emebdding wembed candidate enn synonym net discovered synonym entities candidate enn candidate enn candidate entity enn candidate enn nn search entity representation learning figure : synonym discovery during the inference phase with syn- onymnet. when given a query entity e, it is tedious and very ineffective to verify its synonymity with all the other possible entities. in the rst step, we train entity representation unsupervisely from the massive corpus d using meth- ods such as skipgram or glove . an embedding matrix can be learned wembed rvdembed, where v is the number of unique tokens in d. although these unsupervised meth- ods utilize the context information to learn semantically meaningful representations for entities, they are not tai- lored for the entity synonym discovery task. for example, nba championship, chicago black hawks and american league championship series have similar representations because they tend to share some similar neighboring words. but they are not synonyms with each other. however, they do serve as an effective way to obtain candidates because they tend to give entities with similar neighboring context words similar representations. in the second step, we construct a candidate entity list enn by nding nearest neighbors of a query entity e in the entity embedding space of rdembed. ranking entities by their embedding proximities with the query entity signicantly narrows down the search space for synonym discovery. in the third step, for each candidate entity enn enn and the query entity e, we randomly fetch multiple pieces of contexts in which entities are mentioned, and feed them into the proposed synonymnet model. in the last step, synonymnet calculates a score s based on the bilateral matching with leaky units over multiple pieces of contexts. the candidate entity enn is considered as a synonym to the query entity e when it receives a higher score s than other non-synonym entities, or exceeds a specic threshold.","The inference phase aims to find synonym entities for a given query entity efficiently.

"synonym discovery the synonym discovery focuses on detecting entity synonyms. most existing works try to achieve this goal by learning from structured information such as query logs [ren and cheng, ; chaudhuri et al., ; wei et al., ]. while in this work, we focus on synonym discovery from free-text natural language con- texts, which requires less annotation and is more challeng- ing. some existing works try to detect entity synonyms by entity-level similarities [lin et al., ; roller et al., ; neculoiu et al., ; wieting et al., ]. for example, dis- tributional features are introduced in for hypernym detection. character-level encoding approaches such as treat each entity as a sequence of characters, and use a bi-lstm to encode the entity infor- mation. such approach may be helpful for synonyms with similar spellings, or abbreviations. without considering the context information, it is hard for the aforementioned meth- ods to infer synonyms that share similar semantics but are not alike verbatim. various approaches [snow et al., ; sun and grishman, ; liao et al., ; cambria et al., ] are proposed to incorporate context information to characterize entity mentions. these models are not designed for synonym discovery. dependency parsing result and man- ually crafted rules on the contexts are used in as the structured annotations for synonym discovery. [mud- gal et al., ; kasai et al., ] assume that entities are given as structured records extracted from texts, where each entity record provides contextual information about the en- tity. the goal is to determine whether two entities are the same by comparing and aligning their attributes. we discover synonym entities without such structured annotations. sentence matching there is another related research area that studies sentence matching. early works try to learn a meaningful single vector to represent the sentence [tan et al., ; mueller and thyagarajan, ]. dssm style convolution encoders are adopted in [huang et al., ; shen et al., ; palangi et al., ] to learn sentence representations. they utilize user click-through data and learn query/document embeddings for information retrieval and web search ranking tasks. although the above meth- ods achieve decent performance on sentence-level matching, the sentence matching task is different from context model- ing for synonym discovery in essence. context matching fo- cuses on local information, while the overall sentence could contain much more information, which is useful to repre- sent the sentence-level semantics, but can be quite noisy for context modeling. matching schemes on multiple instances with varying granularities are introduced in [wang and jiang, ; wang et al., ; wang et al., ]. however, these models do not consider the word-level interactions from two sentences during the matching. sentence matching models do not explicitly deal with uninformative instances. in con- text matching, missing such property could be unsatisfactory as noisy contexts exist among multiple contexts for an entity. we adopt a bilateral matching which involves a leaky unit to explicitly deal with uninformative contexts while preserving the expression diversity from multiple pieces of contexts.","The section on Related Works discusses existing approaches to synonym discovery, focusing on detecting entity synonyms from free-text natural language contexts. Different methods are explored, including using structured annotations, entity-level similarities, and incorporating context information. The text also mentions research on sentence matching, with approaches like DSSM style convolution encoders for learning sentence representations.

The text introduces a bilateral matching approach to address noisy contexts and uninformative instances in context modeling."
"in this paper, we propose a framework for synonym discovery from free-text corpus in an open-world setting. a novel neu- ral network model synonymnet is introduced for synonym detection, which tries to determine whether or not two given entities are synonym with each other. synonymnet makes use of multiple pieces of contexts in which each entity is men- tioned, and compares the context-level similarity via a bilat- eral matching schema to determine synonymity. experiments on three real-world datasets show that the proposed method synonymnet has the ability to discover synonym entities effectively on both generic and domain-specic datasets with an improvement up to % in auc and % in map. acknowledgments we thank the reviewers for their valuable comments. this work is supported in part by nsf under grants iii-, iii-, iii-, and cns- references erik cambria, soujanya poria, deva- manyu hazarika, and kenneth kwok. senticnet : dis- covering conceptual primitives for sentiment analysis by means of context embeddings. in aaai, surajit chaudhuri, venkatesh ganti, and dong xin. exploiting web search to generate synonyms for entities. in www, pages , john r firth. a synopsis of linguistic theory, - studies in linguistic analysis, zellig s harris. distributional structure. word, :, sepp hochreiter and j urgen schmidhuber. long short-term memory. neural computation, :, po-sen huang, xiaodong he, jianfeng gao, li deng, alex acero, and larry heck. learning deep structured semantic models for web search using click- through data. in cikm, pages , jungo kasai, kun qian, sairam gura- jada, yunyao li, and lucian popa. low-resource deep entity resolution with transfer and active learning. acl, zhen liao, xinying song, yelong shen, saekoo lee, jianfeng gao, and ciya liao. deep context modeling for web query entity disambiguation. in cikm, pages , dekang lin, shaojun zhao, lijuan qin, and ming zhou. identifying synonyms among distribu- tionally similar words. in ijcai, volume , pages , tomas mikolov, ilya sutskever, kai chen, greg s corrado, and jeff dean. distributed rep- resentations of words and phrases and their composition- ality. in nips, pages , sidharth mudgal, han li, theodoros rekatsinas, anhai doan, youngchoon park, ganesh krishnan, rohit deep, esteban arcaute, and vijay raghavendra. deep learning for entity matching: a de- sign space exploration. in sigmod, pages , jonas mueller and aditya thyagarajan. siamese recurrent architectures for learning sentence similarity. in aaai, pages , paul neculoiu, maarten versteegh, and mihai rotaru. learning text similarity with siamese recurrent networks. in proceedings of the st workshop on representation learning for nlp, pages , hamid palangi, li deng, yelong shen, jianfeng gao, xiaodong he, jianshu chen, xinying song, and rabab ward. deep sentence embedding using long short-term memory networks: analysis and application to information retrieval. taslp, :, jeffrey pennington, richard socher, and christopher manning. glove: global vectors for word representation. in emnlp, pages , matthew peters, mark neumann, mohit iyyer, matt gardner, christopher clark, kenton lee, and luke zettlemoyer. deep contextualized word representa- tions. in naacl, volume , pages , meng qu, xiang ren, and jiawei han. au- tomatic synonym discovery with knowledge bases. in kdd, pages , xiang ren and tao cheng. syn- onym discovery for structured entities on heterogeneous graphs. in www, pages , stephen roller, katrin erk, and gemma boleda. inclusive yet selective: supervised distributional hypernymy detection. in coling, pages , yelong shen, xiaodong he, jianfeng gao, li deng, and gr egoire mesnil. learning seman- tic representations using convolutional neural networks for web search. in www, pages , rion snow, daniel jurafsky, and an- drew y ng. learning syntactic patterns for automatic hy- pernym discovery. in nips, pages , ang sun and ralph grishman. semi-supervised semantic pattern discovery with guidance from unsupervised pattern clusters. in coling, pages , ming tan, cicero dos santos, bing xi- ang, and bowen zhou. lstm-based deep learning mod- els for non-factoid answer selection. arxiv preprint arxiv:, shuohang wang and jing jiang. a compare-aggregate model for matching text sequences. iclr, zhiguo wang, haitao mi, wael hamza, and radu florian. multi-perspective context match- ing for machine comprehension. arxiv preprint arxiv:, zhiguo wang, wael hamza, and radu florian. bilateral multi-perspective matching for natural language sentences. in ijcai, pages , xing wei, fuchun peng, huihsin tseng, yumao lu, and benoit dumoulin. context sensitive syn- onym discovery for web search queries. in cikm, pages , john wieting, mohit bansal, kevin gimpel, and karen livescu. charagram: embedding words and sentences via character n-grams. arxiv preprint arxiv:,",The paper introduces a framework called SynonymNet for discovering synonyms from free-text corpora in an open-world setting.

Powerful radio sources and quasars emit jets of plasma and magnetic fields that travel long distances, depositing energy into the surrounding medium. The energy density of the cosmic microwave background is enhanced by the relativistic motion of the jets, leading to inverse Compton scattering as a primary loss mechanism for the relativistic electrons. By using Chandra to survey a subset of radio sources with high redshifts, researchers have observed X-rays extending beyond detectable radio jets in some cases. Key factors include enhanced energy densities at large redshifts and the interaction of relativistic jets with their surroundings."
"the number of quasars known in the redshift range z> and beyond z= has exploded in recent years, with the sloan dig- ital sky survey playing a key role. at redshift the universe is less than a billion years old, and at redshift only about billion years, or % of the current age estimate based on the planck satellite measurements (planck collabo- ration, aghanim, akrami, & ashdown, ) of the cosmic microwave background following these results, we expect the facilities coming on line in the next decade, such as ska, the lsst, jwst, and the proposed lynx x-ray observa- tory, to allow us to trace formation and growth from the rst massive black holes and galaxies to the present cosmic epoch. x-ray observations will play a crucial role in delineating this development of structure in the

vations . the redshifts of those quasars ranged from to . the x-ray emission is interpreted most simply as radiation from inverse compton up-scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons within a kpc-scale jet that is moving relativistically (bulk lorentz factor ) with respect to the co-moving frame of the par- ent quasar. the bulk relativistic motion explains the one-sided nature of the jets via doppler boosting, and is indicated by apparent superluminal motion and by radio brightness tem- peratures in excess of k on pc and sub-pc scales. in the presence of magnetic elds and photons, relativistic electrons will scatter oboth, emitting synchrotron radiation and ic radiation. the dominant energy loss for the electrons simply depends on the energy density of the target elds or photons. arxiv:v dec daniel a schwartz et al the compton scattering is often called external compton to distinguish from synchrotron self-compton emission. in the rest frame of a relativistic jet, the external photons will appear highly anisotropic, and their energy density appear enhanced by a factor approximately the scattered radiation is highly anisotropic in the frame of an observer that is nearly at rest with respect to the cmb. the intensity is enhanced, or diminished, by a factor +where = ) is the doppler factor. here is the spectral index of the radiation (dened for ux density ), = is the bulk lorentz fac- tor of the jet and is the angle from the jet direction to the observer line of sight. at lower redshifts the ic/cmb mechanism is not usually dominant. x-rays from fr i type radio jets are best explained as an extension of the radio synchrotron spectrum (harris & krawczynski, ). for several quasars the gamma-rays which are predicted by ic/cmb fall above upper limits from the fermi gamma-ray telescope . how- ever, since the energy density of the cmb increases with redshift as , ic/cmb eventually becomes dominant. figure plots the magnetic eld strength vs. redshift at which magnetic and cmb energy densities become equal. this occurs at redshifts max [( ), ]. the gure shows four cases, = , , , and for mag- netic eld strengths below the curve for the given value of , ic/cmb will dominate. at redshifts greater than this occurs for magnetic elds weaker than gauss, even for bulk motion with , and occurs for elds weaker than s of gauss for modest values of . for comparison, mag- netic elds in lower redshift jets are typically estimated to be a few s of gauss. very near a quasar, photons from the accretion disk, the broad line clouds, and the dusty torus will dominate. the ic/cmb will be the dominant external compton mechanism at distances from the quasar core ), where l is the radiative luminosity of the quasar in units of erg s jets at high redshift should increasingly manifest as x-ray jets rather than radio jets. two factors favor the x-ray emission. the rst results from the cosmological diminution of surface brightness, which is proportional to this reduces the ability to detect extended radio sources. however, for ic/cmb x-ray emission this is compensated by the increase of the cmb energy density. the second factor is due to the shorter lifetimes of the electrons emitting ghz synchrotron radiation. very roughly, electrons with lorentz factor / are produc- ing the kev radiation. figure shows the lifetime for such figure criteria for

one knot along the x-ray jet from the quasar core . based on that dis- covery, and the rationale discussed above, we have undertaken a chandra survey for more systems dominated by x-ray jets.","The number of known quasars in the redshift range z>3 has significantly increased, with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey being notable in this growth. The universe is less than a billion years old at z=6 and only about 5% of the current cosmic age estimate at z=7, according to Planck satellite measurements. Future facilities like SKA, LSST, JWST, and Lynx X-ray Observatory are expected to trace the formation and growth of black holes and galaxies. X-ray observations, such as those from Lynx, will be crucial in studying the structure of the universe. X-ray surveys and observations with Chandra may reveal new active galaxies at high redshifts. The text discusses the significance of external Compton scattering, dominant energy losses for electrons, and factors favoring X-ray emission over radio emission in high-redshift jets. The IC/CMB mechanism is predicted to become dominant as redshift increases, particularly due to the increase in CMB energy density. Ongoing research aims to discover more systems dominated by X-ray jets, building upon previous observations of quasars emitting long X-ray jets at high redshifts."
"our sample is based on a survey conducted by gobeille, wardle, & cheung . that survey covered the area jointly observed in the first radio survey (becker, white, & helfand, ) and optically by the sloan digital sky sur- vey . it contains all quasars at redshifts with a spectroscopic redshift measured in the sdss, and with a radio ux density greater than mjy at ghz (gregory, scott, douglas, & condon, ). the radio ux was summed from the total system, including any extended emission. of the quasars, showed extended emission. thirty of these were classied as triples, and as such we considered that they were probably not beamed in our direction. of the remaining , we selected the with redshift z> as most likely to be detectable ic/cmb radiators in ks chandra observations. the two at the largest redshifts, j+ at z= and j+ at z=, had previously been detected at counts ks (che- ung et al., ) and counts ks (siemiginowska et al., ), respectively, and were not re-observed.","A survey conducted by Gobeille, Wardle, & Cheung identified quasars with spectroscopic redshifts measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and radio flux density greater than 1 mJy at GHz.

Those with redshifts greater than were selected for potential detection as IC/CMB radiators in KS Chandra observations.

in column we predicted the counts expected in the kev band if their ux scaled from that of j+ and j+ simply by the ratio of for their redshifts. the counting rates of those two sources previously

and j we do have statistically signicant detections, with the number of counts as tabulated. for other quasars, we do not have signicant indication of a jet. for the systems without an apparent jet, the exact upper limit must be carefully considered for each case. to get a rough idea, since we typically can expect one scattered x-ray from the quasar core, and negligible background in ks, four counts would be a detection to % condence for any one source. however, since we have targets, we require counts such table chandra high redshift sample: z> predicted detected counts jet source name

the jet x-ray ux is erg cm s, which would correspond to a luminosity of erg s if it were isotrop- ically emitted. the quasar core has photons, giving an x-ray ux of erg cm s and a luminosity of erg s thus the jet x-ray ux is % that of the quasar core, with a factor of uncertainty. j+ figure plots the to kev x-ray data from our observa- tion of j+ there is signicant x-ray emission along the dashed

measured ux of erg cm s or an isotropic luminosity of erg s the x-ray jet ux is apparently % of the quasar x-ray ux. a mas long jet extends in the same direction in an ghz vlbi observation by bourda, collioud, charlot, porcas, & garrington . our jvla observations centered at ghz show no indication of emission outside of the region around the quasar, up to the edge of the lobe at from the core, with a mjy upper limit. at ghz the ux density is mjy from the core, and mjy from the nw lobe. the radio lobe and the vlbi structure each show a one- sided system, which indicates a relativistic jet. we can con- struct an illustrative ic/cmb model by taking the radio ux density to equal mjy at ghz. we use usual assumptions, ; worrall & birkinshaw ) of minimum energy in the magnetic eld and relativistic parti- cles, relativistic electrons with a power law spectral index from = to =, a jet width of kpc, charge balance pro- vided by equal numbers of protons, and uniformly tangled and isotropic distribution of particles and elds in the jet rest frame. we make the assumption that the bulk lorentz factor equals the doppler factor. this is equivalent to assuming the jet is at the largest possible angle to the line of sight for the given doppler factor. we nd ==, a magnetic eld strength gauss, and a kinetic power erg s such a jet would be at an angle to our line of sight. daniel a schwartz et al electrons emitting the ghz radiation have lorentz fac- tors , their lifetime against energy loss by ic scattering of the cmb is only years, compared to , years for the electrons with which are emitting kev x-rays. the short radio lifetime shows that it is reasonable that only the x-rays are detectable. with the true radio ux density being less than mjy, both the magnetic eld strength and the relativistic particle density will be smaller if we preserve the minimum energy assumption. in that case the jet must have a larger bulk lorentz factor since the cmb energy density in the jet must be enhanced further in order to produce the same x-ray emission. conversely, if the x-ray ux is at the lower limit allowed, the magnetic eld strength and particle densities would be larger, and the jet lorentz factor smaller. discussion the numbers of predicted counts, column in table , assumes that the jets are identical in their intrinsic properties, magnetic eld, particle density and spectrum, bulk lorentz factor, age and size, and furthermore at the same angle to our line of sight as the object j+ from which they are scaled. this is clearly unrealistic, but does correctly predict for at least of the sources at redshift greater than , and has resulted in discovery of two new x-ray jets among the quasars observed so far. for each individual source in table the upper limit may allow that the predicted counts are cor- rect. however, the ensemble of sources predicts counts, where we have no more than , so that clearly the average emission is less than our scaling model. strictly speaking, we cannot claim that we have discov- ered jets according to a common denition (bridle & perley, ) requiring the length to be at least four times the width for a radio jet. we do have denite statistical detection of x- ray emission extended outside the quasar x-ray/radio core. the emission is statistically connected to a direction dened a priori by radio observations, i.e., extremely unlikely to be a background or foreground source not associated with the sys- tem. however, we have no information on the structure of the x-ray jet, e.g., whether it is continuous or even just a single knot of emission. simionescu et al. made the critical discovery of an x-ray jet from the quasar j+, that was not coincident with a radio jet. we have now discovered two more cases of x-ray jets which are not coincident with underlying radio jets, establishing that such a class of object exists. table com- pares the observed properties of these three objects. the ux is taken in the to kev band. we convert to surface bright- ness in units of erg cm s arcsec by dividing by table comparison of the x-ray dominated jets. j j j redshift live time counts flux erg cm s length surface brightness j live time, counts, and length from simionescu et al. the tabulated length of each jet, and by an assumed width for each jet. that width is roughly kpc at redshifts of a few. the resulting surface brightness is remarkably similar for the three sources, but with up to a factor of two uncertainty for the two new jets reported here. this could indicate similar phys- ical conditions in the three jets, or could just reect that they are all near the threshold of detection for a ks observation. however, a very signicant dierence is that the jet in j is detected with an x-ray ux % that of the quasar, while the two new jets here have only about % of the quasar ux, con- sistent with the observations from the survey at lower redshift . these objects are potentially extremely important, because they can be detected in x-rays at whatever large redshift they exist, due to their approximately constant surface bright- ness. however, discovery of relativistic x-ray jets is dicult, because only the few percent of radio quasars which are beamed in our direction are candidate systems, so that it is expensive in observing time to use pointed chandra observa- tions for this purpose. we look forward to the all sky survey by the erosita instrument on the spectrum x-gamma satel- lite to provide target systems. while erosita does not have the angular resolution to resolve jets, it should result in unidentied blank sky sources which are candidates to be very distant orphan x-ray jets. these candidates will be reasonable targets for chandra observations, and for the much more powerful lynx observatory which is proposed to be the chandra successor, with times the eective area and similar angular resolution in the to kev region. further- more, lynx with have times larger grasp than chandra and can therefore do surveys of tens of square degrees with similar sensitivity. daniel a schwartz et al acknowledgments this research was funded by nasa grant go-x and

"introduction a recent contribution introduced a number of criteria for generalized convexity properties (including quasiconvexity) of so-called conformally invariant functions on the group gl + of - matrices with positive determinant, i.e. functions w : gl + r with w = w for all a, b cso , where cso := r+ so = {ar gl + | a , r so} denotes the conformal special orthogonal group. this requirement can equivalently be expressed as w = w = w , w = w for all r, r so , a , i.e. left- and right-invariance under the special orthogonal group so and invariance under scaling. in nonlinear elasticity theory, where f = represents the so-called deformation gradient of a deformation , the former two invariances correspond to the objectivity and isotropy of w, respectively. in this context, an note that this invariance property needs to be distinguished from the concept of conformal energies , i.e. functions w such that w = if and only if f cso, e.g. w = f det f. instead of invariances of the argument, these energies are characterized by a global potential well containing the unbounded set cso and can merely be considered conformally invariant in f = in a planar minimization problem subject to the homeomorphic boundary condition |= , the -harmonic dirichlet energy i = r dx is sometimes referred to as a conformal energy as well. indeed, i = z dx z det dx = z det dx , and equality holds if and only if is conformal, due to hadamards inequality and the fact that det is a null lagrangian. however, the energy density w = f is neither conformally invariant in the sense of nor conformal in the above sense. energy w satisfying w = w is more commonly known as isochoric, and is often additively coupled with a volumetric energy term of the form f for some convex function f : r. in this contribution, we consider the quasiconvex envelopes of conformally invariant energies on gl +. based on our previous results, we provide an explicit formula that allows for a direct computation of the quasiconvex envelope for this class of functions. we also discuss dierent ways of expressing conformally invariant energies, including representations based on the singular values of f, i.e. the eigenvalues of f t f, in order to highlight the diculties which arise from focusing on the seemingly more simple representation in terms of the distortion function k. our main result has been tested against a numerical algorithm for computing the polycon- vex envelope for a range of parameters, yielding agreement up to computational precision. in two special cases, we show that our results completely match previous developments of astala, iwaniec, and martin and yan . we also present direct nite element simulations of the microstructure using a trust- regionmultigrid method which show consistent results. in the appendix, we answer two questions by adamowicz , and discuss a related relaxation result by dacorogna and koshigoe . conformal and quasiconformal mappings energy functions of the form are intrinsically linked to conformal geometry and geometric function theory . a mapping : r is called conformal if and only if cso on or, equivalently, t = , where gl + denotes the identity matrix. if r is identied with the complex plane c, then is conformal if and only if : c c is holomorphic and the derivative is non-zero everywhere. although the riemann mapping theorem states that any non-empty, simply connected open planar domain can be mapped conformally to the unit disc, conformal mappings exhibit aspects of rigidity that make them too restrictive for many interesting applications. in particular, since the riemann mapping is uniquely determined by prescribing the function value for three points, conformal mappings are not able to satisfy arbitrary boundary conditions. a signicantly larger and more exible class is given by the so-called quasiconformal mappings, i.e. functions : r that satisfy the uniform bound k:= ess sup x k) l for some l , where k denotes the distortion function or outer distortion k: gl + r , k := f det f = p i,j= f ij det f . due to hadamards inequality, k for all f gl +. in particular, if is satised with l = , then k , which implies that is conformal. the classical gr otzsch free boundary value problem is to nd and characterize quasiconformal mappings of rectangles into rectangles that minimize the maximal distortion kand map faces to corresponding faces, i.e. to solve the minimization problem kmin , : , = {} , = {} , = {} , = {a} . a much more involved problem has been solved by teichm uller . the classical teichm uller problem is to nd and characterize quasiconformal solutions to kmin , w , , |b = x , = a for < a < computational approaches for calculating extremal quasiconformal mappings (with direct applications in engineering) are discussed, e.g., in . however, the analytical diculties posed by this problem also motivate the study of integral generalizations of , i.e. z b ) dx min , w , , |b = x , = a , where : [, ) [, ) is assumed to be strictly increasing. further generalizing the domain, boundary condition and additional constraints, we obtain a more classical problem in the calculus of variations: the existence and uniqueness of mappings between planar domains with prescribed boundary values that minimize certain integral functions of k, i.e. the minimization problem z ) dx min , w , , = for given : [, ) r and : r since k = k = k for all a > and all r so, the distortion function k is conformally invariant, and indeed every conformally invariant energy w on gl + can be expressed in the form w = ), see . however, the mapping f k is non-convex. without additional restrictions on , it is therefore dicult to establish results regarding the existence or regularity of minimizers. it is generally believed [, conjecture ., p. ] that for well-behaved functions , e.g. if is smooth, strictly increasing and convex, any solution to the minimization problem is a c,-dieomorphism; this would contrast typical regularity results for more general problems in the calculus of variations , where only partial regularity can be expected. in this contribution, we are interested in cases where is not well behaved in the above sense; more specically, we allow for some lack of convexity and monotonicity of . our results demonstrate that the common representation w = ) of an arbitrary conformally invariant function w on gl + is neither ideal nor natural as far as convexity properties of w are concerned. instead, by introducing the linear distortion dilatation ) k = f op det f = max( f t f) min( f t f) = k + p k = earccosh k , i.e. k =  k + k  , where fop = sup=f r denotes the operator norm of f, we can equivalently express any conformally invariant energy w as w = h). this representation turns out to be much more convenient and suitable with respect to convexity properties of w. in particular, our results will allow us to easily generalize a consequence of a theorem by astala, iwaniec and martin , stating that for f gl + and = b and any strictly increasing : [, ) [, ) with sublinear growth, inf (z b ) dx , w ,, r) , b = fx ) = . note that the corresponding minimization problem has no solution unless f cso. this result can be expressed as a specic relaxation statement, namely that for these w = ), the quasiconvex envelope qw of w is given by qw . quasiconvex envelopes arise naturally in the calculus of variations, representing the energetic response of a minimization problem without minimizers for linearly homogeneous boundary values under the presence of microstructure, i.e. qw = inf  || z w dx , w ,p , = fx  note that the existence of minimizers follows from the polyconvexity of the mapping f ). on the other hand, since the distortion function k is dierentiable on all of gl + whereas the mapping f k is not, it is advised to base numerical approaches to relaxation of conformally invariant energies on k. for any domain r with lebesgue measure ||. if qw < w for some f gl +, then the equilibrium state of the homogeneous deformation = fx is unstable: the material shows an energetic preference to develop ner and ner spatially modulated deformations (in engineering applications these are typically shear bands) at xed averaged deformation fx. in this case, there are inmizing sequences with highly oscillating gradients which converge weakly , but the weak limit is not a minimizer. in this respect, our main result also answers a particular case of iwaniecs question from : which distortion are weakly lower semi-continuous in w ,? convexity properties of conformally invariant functions in nonlinear elasticity theory, three generalized convexity properties of an energy function w : gl + r are of particular interest: rank-one convexity, i.e. for all f gl +, t and h r with rank = and det > , wf + t) w + tw ; quasiconvexity, i.e. for every bounded open set r and all c such that det > , z w dx z w dx = w || ; and polyconvexity of w, i.e. w = p for some convex function p : r r = r r {+} . the importance of quasiconvexity stems from the fact that quasiconvexity of w is essentially equivalent to the weak lower semi-continuity of r w)dx . the problem z w) dx min , w , , = fx has a solution if and only if qw = w; if qw < w, then inmizing sequences exhibit microstructure eects. under appropriate technical assumptions, convexity = polyconvexity = quasiconvexity = rank-one convexity , whereas for dimension n , it is well known that the corresponding convexity properties are not equiva- lent; sverak famously showed that rank-one convexity does not imply quasiconvexity with a counterexample consisting of a non-isotropic, non-objective polynomial of order four . in the two-dimensional case dis- cussed here, however, the question whether rank-one convexity is equivalent to quasiconvexity, known as the remaining part of morreys conjecture , is still unanswered and is considered one of the major open problems in the calculus of variations . in order to state criteria for the above convexity properties in the special case of conformally invariant functions on gl +, we consider a number of dierent representations available to express such functions. lemma . let w : gl + r be conformally invariant. then there exist uniquely determined functions g: r, h: r and : [, ) r such that w = g = h   = ) for all f gl + with singular values , , where k := f det f and . denotes the frobenius matrix norm with f = p i,j= f ij. furthermore, h = h  x  , g = g and g = g for all a, x, y . conversely, if the requirements are satised for otherwise arbitrary functions g: r, h: r or : [, ) r, then denes a conformally invariant function w. note that h is already uniquely determined by its values on [, ) and recall that k , with k = if and only if is conformal. the following proposition summarizes the main results from and completely characterizes the gener- alized convexity of conformally invariant functions on gl +. proposition . let w : gl + r be conformally invariant, and let g: r, h: r and : [, ) r denote the uniquely determined functions with w = g = h   = ) for all f gl + with singular values , , where k = f det f . then the following are equivalent: i) w is polyconvex, ii) w is quasiconvex, iii) w is rank-one convex, iv) g is separately convex, v) h is convex on , vi) h is convex and non-decreasing on [, ). furthermore, if is twice continuously dierentiable, then i)vi) are equivalent to vii) (x + x ) + for all x . note that in terms of the representation function h, the convexity criteria can be expressed in a remarkably simple way, especially when compared to vii), i.e. the representation in terms of the classical distortion k. in particular, while monotonicity and convexity of are sucient for the considered properties, convexity of the energy with respect to k is not a necessary condition; for example, if w : gl + r is given by w = max{, } min{, } = max  ,  = k + p k = earccosh) , then w is polyconvex due to the convexity of x h = max{x, x} on , whereas the representing function : [, ) r with = x + x is monotone increasing but not convex. recall that the mapping f k itself is polyconvex on gl +. example . consider the isochoric, conformally invariant st. venantkirchho-type energy function w : gl + r , w = f t f det f =   +   = k) , where denotes the identity matrix. this energy w can be expressed in the form with g = x y  + y x  , h = +  x  , = . since h: r is convex, the planar isochoric st. venantkirchhoenergy is quasiconvex according to proposition , while, e.g. the non-conformally-invariant term f t f = + is not, cf. appendix c. generalized convexity properties and convex envelopes for each of the convexity properties listed in the previous section, we can consider the corresponding envelope of an arbitrary energy function w : gl + r, i.e. rw = sup{w | w: gl + r rank-one convex, w w for all x gl +} , qw = sup{w | w: gl + r quasiconvex, w w for all x gl +} , pw = sup{w | w: gl + r polyconvex, w w for all x gl +} , cw = sup{w | w: gl + r convex, w w for all x gl +} . since polyconvexity implies quasiconvexity, which in turn implies rank-one convexity (cf. for the case of isotropic functions on gl +), it is easy to see that cw pw qw rw. however, while a number of numerical methods are available to approximate the rank-one convex envelope rw as well as the polyconvex envelope pw , it is dicult to analytically compute rw, pw or the quasiconvex envelope qw of a given energy w in general, although explicit representations have been found for a number of particular functions, including the st. venantkirchhoenergy and several challenging problems encountered in engineering applications . further examples can be found in . more general methods for computing the quasiconvex envelope are often based on the observation that rw = pw and thus rw = qw for certain classes of energy functions w. in many such cases, even the equality rw = cw holds , i.e. the generalized convex envelopes are all identical to the classical convex envelope of w, cf. appendix c. yan showed that non-constant rank-one convex conformal energy functions (cf. footnote for the distinction between conformally invariant and conformal energy functions) dened on all of rnn for n must grow at least with power n , which implies that the quasiconvex envelope of a conformal energy w on r must be constant if w exhibits sublinear growth. the results given in the following show that an analogous property holds for conformally invariant energies on gl +. in order to apply proposition to the computation of generalized convex envelopes, the following invariance property of the rank-one convex envelope will be required. lemma . if w : gl + r is conformally invariant, then rw is conformally invariant. examples of functions where pw < qw were examined, for example, by gangbo . this result is essentially sharp: m uller, sver ak and yan have shown that there exists a nontrivial quasi- convex conformal energy function w : r r with a constant c+ > such that for all f r, w c+ and w = f cso . proof. it is well known that the left- and right-so-invariance is preserved by the rank-one convex envelope , so due to the characterization of conformal invariance it remains to show that rw = rw for all a > and all f gl +. we use the characterization rw = limkrkw of the rank-one convex envelope , where rw = w and rk+w := inf n trkw + rkw | t , tf + f = f, rank = o , and show by induction that rkw = rkw for all k first, we nd rw = w = w = rw, so assume that rkw = rkw for some k for any > , choose f, f gl + and t with tf+f = f and rank = such that trkw+rkw rk+w + . then, since taf + af = af and rank = , rk+w trkw + rkw = trkw + rkw rk+w + , thus rk+w rk+w. analogously, we nd rk+w rk+w and thereby rw = limkrkw = limkrkw = rw. remark . by direct computation, it is easy to see that qw is conformally invariant if w : gl + r is conformally invariant. similar to the rank-one convex envelope it is well known that the left- and right-so-invariance is preserved by qw, and the equality qw = inf c || z w dx = inf c || z w  a  f + a  dx = inf c || z w  f + a  dx = inf e c || z w(f + e ) dx = qw , can be obtained by utilizing the scaling invariance w = w for all a > and f gl +. main result on the quasiconvex envelope we can now state our main result. theorem . let w : gl + r be conformally invariant, and let h: [, ) r denote the function uniquely determined by w = h   for all f gl + with ordered singular values then rw = qw = pw = cmh   for all f gl + , where cmh: [, ) r denotes the monotone-convex envelope given by cmh := sup n p | p: [, ) r monotone increasing and convex with p h s [, ) o . proof. let w := cmh   . due to the convexity and monotonicity of cmh and proposition , the mapping w: gl + r is polyconvex. therefore, since w = cmh   h   = w , we nd w pw for all f gl +. since pw qw rw, it only remains to show that rw w in order to establish . according to lemma , rw is conformally invariant, thus according to lemma there exists a uniquely determined e h: [, ) r such that rw = e h   for all f gl + with singular values due to the rank-one convexity of rw and proposition , the function e h is convex and non-decreasing. since e h = rw) w) = h as well, we nd e h cmh for all t [, ) and thus rw = e h   cmh   = w for all f gl +. remark . if h is monotone increasing, then cmh = ch, i.e. the monotone-convex envelope (which is the largest convex non-decreasing function not exceeding h ) is identical to the convex envelope ch of h on [, ). furthermore, if h is continuous, then computing the monotone-convex envelope cmh can easily be reduced to the simple one-dimensional problem of nding the convex envelope ce h of the function e h: [, ) r , e h = min s[,) h : t min argmin h , h : otherwise, where min argmin h = min{s [, ) | h = min h}, cf. figure in particular, if h attains its minimum at , then e h = h and thus cmh = ch. note that if h is not bounded below, then cmh is not well dened (and neither is rw). remark . if : [, ) r is strictly monotone with sublinear growth, then both these properties hold for the function h: [, ) r with ) = h( ) =: w as well, which implies qw = cmh = ch h = . for this special case, we directly recover the earlier result originally due to astala, iwaniec, and martin . remark . the monotone-convex envelope of h: [, ) r can also be obtained by reecting the graph of the function at x = and taking the classical convex envelope: if b h: r r denotes the extension of h to r dened by b h := ( h : x > , h : x , then cmh = cb h|r, cf. figure and appendix a. specic relaxation examples and numerical simulations theorem can be used to explicitly compute the quasiconvex envelope for a substantial class of functions. in the following, a number of explicit relaxation examples will be considered and some of our analytical results will be compared to numerical simulations. h cmh x b h ch cb h x figure : left: example of a monotone-convex envelope. right: the monotone-convex envelope cmh of h: [, ) r can be obtained by restricting the convex envelope cb h of a suitably extension b h: r r of h back to [, ). the deviatoric hencky energy first, consider the deviatoric hencky strain energy wdh : gl + r, wdh = dev log u = dev log f t f= "" log f det f + s f !# = h log  k + p k i = arccosh) , where devn x := x n tr is the deviatoric part of x rnn and log u denotes the principal matrix logarithm of the right stretch tensor u := f t f. the energy wdh can be expressed as wdh = log   . since the representing function h: [, ) r with h = log is monotone, we nd cmh = ch = for all t [, ) and thus rwdh = qwdh = pwdh . note that due to the sublinear growth of h ), this result can also be obtained by eq. , cf. remark . interestingly, the deviatoric hencky strain energy itself is directly related to the conformal group cso: let distgeod denote the geodesic distance on the lie group gl + with respect to the canonical left- invariant riemannian metric . then the distance of f gl + to the special orthogonal group so gl + is given by dist geod) = min e rso dist geod(f, e r) = log u . the deviatoric hencky strain energy can therefore be characterized by the equality dist geod) = min acso dist geod = min e rso a dist geod(f, a e r) = min a min e rso dist geod f a , e r  = min a log u a = min a log = devn log u , where holds due to the left-invariance of the metric. the squared logarithm of k similarly, consider wlog = = log   +  , i.e. h = log   t + t  . since h is again monotone on [, ), we nd cmh = ch = for all t [, ) and thus rwlog = qwlog = pw . t h t h

energy weh : gl + r , weh = ekdev log u for some parameter k > it has previously been shown that weh is polyconvex (and thus quasiconvex) for k for any < k < , we can explicitly compute the quasiconvex envelope: since weh = ek log    , and since the mapping t h = ek log is monotone increasing on [, ), we nd rweh = qweh = pweh = ch   for all f gl + with singular values , in order to further investigate the behavior of this quasiconvex relaxation with nite element simulations, we choose the particular value k = < and consider the quasiconvex envelope qw of w = h   = e  log  = e . using maxwells equal area rule , we numerically compute the monotone-convex envelope of h up to ve decimal digits: cmh = ch = h : t , + t : < t < , h : t . this explicit representation allows us to determine the set of all f gl + with qw < w, known as the binodal region . in particular, the microstructure energy gap between h and ch is maximal at =: x with a value of . we therefore choose homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions given by f = x x  =   , such that det f = , for the nite element simulation. the energy level of the homogeneous solution is i = z b w dx = w , whereas the inmum of the energy levels of the microstructure solutions is inf i = inf (z b w dx , |b = fx ) = ) . x h > h < h > pw = qw = rw = cmh    w = h    maximal microstructure energy gap figure :

numerical simulations of the microstructure on triangle grids with dierent resolutions. the illustration shows the reference conguration, colored according to the value of the determinant of the deformation gradient . the energy level of the conguration on the left is on a grid with vertices. repeating the computation on a grid with one additional step of uniform renement leads to the conguration on the right, which has an energy level of . note that the values obtained for the energy level still dier signicantly from the expected value of . it is unclear whether the discrepancy is solely due to insucient mesh resolution; further numerical investigations on more performant hardware are planned for the future. the expected energy level was, how- ever, obtained numerically using a modication of an algorithm by bartels for computing the polyconvex envelope. figure : microstructure for the energy w = e with boundary conditions f given by for two dierent mesh resolutions. although the number of oscillations is mesh-dependent, macroscopic quantities like volume ratios are mesh-independent; these macroscopic features are predicted by qw. left: grid vertices, energy level of .

with f = the energy value of the homogeneous solution is i = z b w dx = w , whereas the energy level of the microstructure solution should, in the limit, approach inf i = inf (z b w dx , |b = fx ) = )

deformation b w , with b |= fx and k(b ) = l due to corollary . then l(k(b )) = and thus qw = ( : k l , w : k l , since l is monotone increasing and convex for k l. acknowledgements we thank s oren

directly connected to an earlier result by dacorogna and koshigoe , who obtained an explicit relaxation result for a subclass of conformal energy functions. lemma a. . let w : r r be of the form w := g( q f det f) , g : [, ) r . dene e g : r r , e g = ( g : x > , g : x . then cw = pw = qw = rw = e g q f det f  , where e gis the legendre-transformation of e g and e g= (e g). the same result can be found in . note that the convexity of the mapping f e g( p f det f) = e g( p ) follows directly from the fact that e gis convex and non-decreasing on [, ). furthermore, if g , then w of the form is a conformal energy in the sense of footnote g cmg cg x e g ce g x figure : the monotone-convex envelope cmg of g : [, ) r can be obtained via the convex envelope cmg of the even extension e g of g. if g is continuous and bounded below, then based on it is easy to show that the monotone-convex envelope of g is exactly the restriction of e g to [, ): cmg = (ce g) [,) , ce g = g. similar to the geodesic distance considered in section , the expression p f det f can be characterized as a measure of distance to the conformal group: since the closure cso{} of cso is a linear subspace of r with an orthonormal basis given by a =   , a =   , thus dist euclid) := inf acsof a = f = f + ) = f (f + f + f + f + ) = , where , denotes the canonical inner product on r therefore, the energy functions considered in lemma a. depend only on the euclidean distance of f to cso. b connections to the gr otzsch problem proposition negatively answers a conjecture by adamowicz , which states that if a conformal energy w : gl + r with w = ) is polyconvex, then is non-decreasing and convex. a direct counterexample is given by w = max min , which is polyconvex due to criterion v) in proposition with h = t, but the representation w = ) = earccosh) is not convex with respect to k. furthermore, criterion iv) in proposition reveals a direct connection between the so-called gr otzsch property and quasi- convexity in the two-dimensional case. denition b. . let w : gl + r be conformally invariant. then w satises the gr otzsch property if for every q = rn and every q = [, a ] [, a n] rn, the functional i : a r , i = z q w dx attains its minimum at the ane mapping : q q, = ( a a x, . . . , a n an xn); here, the set a of admissible functions consists of all w ,p loc , p n with det > that satisfy the gr otzsch boundary conditions, i.e. map each dimensional face of q to the corresponding face of q. note that the euclidean distance can be considered a linearization of the geodesic distance and, unlike the latter, does not take into account the lie group structure of either gl + or cso. for a detailed discussion of the relation between these distance measures and their applicability to the deformation gradient in nonlinear mechanics, see . more generally , the set [, ) so is convex for n note that the boundary condition imposed in denition b. does not require the admissible mappings to be ane at the boundary, since each of the faces can be mapped to the corresponding ones in an arbitrary manner. in the two-dimensional case, the representation of the energy in terms of the singular values allows us to infer the quasicon- vexity from the gr otzsch property in a particularly straightforward way. proposition b. let w : gl + r be conformally invariant and satisfy the gr otzsch property for all q, q. then w is polyconvex. proof. assume that w is not polyconvex. then g : r with w = g is not separately convex according to criterion iv) in proposition . therefore, there exist , b , and t such that tg + g(b , ) < gb , ) . now, let q = and q = [, t + b ], and dene : q q by := x x ! : x t , b x + t( b ) x ! : x > t . then satises the gr otzsch boundary conditions, w ,p for all p and z q w dx = z w) dx + z w(diag(b , )) dx = z g dx + z g(b , ) dx = tg + g(b , ) < gb , ) = w = w |q| , where f = diagb , ) is the boundary-compatible linear mapping from q to q. therefore, w does not satisfy the gr otzsch condition. c the convex envelope of conformally invariant planar energies the quasiconvex envelopes computed in section are, in general, not convex, i.e. qw > cw for some f gl +. in fact, the following explicit computation shows that the convex envelope of any conformally invariant energy is necessarily constant. recall that the convex envelope cw of an energy w : m r with a non-convex domain m rnn (e.g. m = gl +) is dened as the restriction cf w|m of the convex envelope cf w of the function f w : conv r {+} , f w = ( w : f m , + : f / m to m, where conv denotes the convex hull of the set m. note that f w can be further extended to a convex function c w on rnn by setting c w = +for all f / conv. proposition c. let w : gl + r be conformally invariant and bounded below. then cw = inf n w( e f) | e f gl + o for all f gl +. proof. we only need to show that cw is constant on gl +. first, observe that the convex envelope of w is conformally invariant. by the denition of convexity on gl + employed here, cw must be the restriction of a convex function c w : r r to gl +. let b := c w. then for all f gl + and t , we nd c w = ( cw = cw : t = , b : t = , thus cw = b due to the convexity of c w. the proof of the bi-so-invariance of cw given by buttazzo et al. can easily be adapted to include the scaling invariance. as indicated in section , analytical methods for nding generalized convex envelopes have often been based on the observation that rw = cw for certain classes of energy functions w and the subsequent computation of the classical convex envelope cw; for example, this method is applicable to the st. venantkirchhoenergy function wsvk = f t f +  tr  one of the most frequently cited examples of an isotropic and objective energy function w with rw = qw = pw = cw is the example of kohn and strang , where, in the r-case , w = ( + f : f = , : f = , with cw = ( w : f , f : f< , but qw = ( w : f+ det f , p f + det f det f : f+ det f < . furthermore, if w : gl + r is a volumetric energy function of the form w = f with f : r, then rw = qw = pw = cf and, in general, cw < qw, see .","The introduction discussed criteria for generalized convexity properties of conformally invariant functions on the group of matrices with positive determinant. These functions must satisfy invariance under scaling and under the special orthogonal group. In the context of nonlinear elasticity theory, these invariances correspond to objectivity and isotropy. Different representations and computations of conformally invariant energies were explored, leading to the development of explicit formulas for computing the quasiconvex envelope for this class of functions.

Special cases and numerical simulations were considered to test the results obtained. It was shown that the quasiconvex envelope matches previous developments by Astala, Iwaniec, Martin, and Yan. The section also discussed conformal and quasiconformal mappings, highlighting the connection between energy functions and conformal geometry. The section concludes with a detailed analysis of conformal energies and their convex envelopes, showcasing the complexity of conformal invariant energy functions and their convexity properties."

"as it was investigated before by a. lucchini a case of generating set of cn p g when g is a nite n-generated group and p is a prime not dividing the order |g| and cp be the cyclic group of order p was investigated by a. lucchini. according to results by a. lucchini the wreath product cn p g is also n-generated. we consider in role of active group g the cyclic group, also we generalize this wreath product on iterated wreath product of such groups and direct product of wreath products of cyclic groups. the similar question for iterated wreath product was studied by bondarenko e. v. in a series of maksymenko s. i. papers were proved that the n-th homotopy groups of the orbit o of f with respect to the right action of the group di of dieo- morphisms of m, coincides with the ones of m for n , o = , while for the fundamental group o it was shown that it contains a free abelian subgroup of - nite index. however the information about o remains incomplete. we found the minimal generating set and relations for one of such o .","The text discusses the investigation of generating sets of wreath products involving cyclic groups and n-generated groups of order p.

"in this work the previous result of the author is strengthen also there is considered new class of wreathcyclic groups which constructed by formula: g = ( n j= ckj) ( n j= ckj) . . .

of wreath product. the sections of the base of wreath product are divided into parts by semicolon too and these parts correspond to groups cij which form the base of wreath product. the l-th section of of a tableau presentation of automorphism corresponds to portrait of automorphism on level xl. the portrait of automorphisms on level xl is characterized by the sequence , where coordinate of l is vertex number of unique non trivial v.p. on xl, the sequence has iiil coordinates. therefore, our rst generator has form = that is the rooted automorphism, second has form = e; , e, e, , e | {z } i ;

generate all canonical generating set. for this goal we obtain the second new generator in form of the tableau lcm = lcm = e; lcm , e, e, , e | {z } i ; e, e, , e | {z } ii ; e, e, , e | {z } iii ; e,

b = is generator of g i.e. it is -base of g. the generator generate the group which is isomorphic to the group of all -th coordinate tableaux that is . by the same principle we obtain = lcm = e; e, e,

coordinate tableaux that is i+ . by the same principle we can express all i of our canonical generating set. if it were a self-similar group, then it would be more usefull to present it in terms of wreath recursion, as the set where is the rooted automorphism. given a permutational representation of cij we can present our group by wreath recursion. we present by wreath recursion as = . it would

described above in theorem in case = are mutually coprime and = are mutually coprime, then we group generator and in vector that is rst generator of direct product ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl). therefore rst generator of g has form and the second generator has form of vector . the generator has a similar structure. to express the generator of canonical set from , we exponent to lcm analogously k =

acting on a set x (active group a can acts not faithfully). consider the set all pairs {, f : x h, a a}. a product on this set is dened by { := (aa, ff a )}, where f a = f). theorem if w = , where |x| = n, |y | = m and is active group acting on x, then d d + d + d. proof. generating set of generators in form of tableaux for w : ai = , t = , , tk = , tl = , where hj, cjl sb, b = sb, ai sa, a = sa. let orbits of an action a on x are {oj}jj. note that, on a each coordinate of tableau, that presents a commutator of and , a a, b b it can be product of form aaa a a and higah abg aba b, this should satisfy the following condition: n y ioj higah abg aba b, j j. viz the product of coordinate of wreath product base is an element of commutator b. as it was described above it is subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with additional condition . it is just the case because not all element of this subdirect product are independent, since even one element have to be chosen in such way in order that holds. if we rearrange all factors in product in the following way: n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) b. where is a commutator in case cw = we express this element from b as commutator if cw = in general case instead of this element we have cw q j= . this commutator are formed as product of commutators of rearranged elements of n q i= higah abg aba we can generate it by generators of form that is in our generating set. therefore, we have a direct product of n the copies of the group b and the multiplier cw q j= from b, which has at least d generators n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) cw y j= b. since ( n q i= higih i g i ) = e and the product cw q j= belongs to b, then condition holds. the assertion of a theorem on a recursive principle is easily generalized on multiple wreath product of groups. then we have direct product of n factors of group b and one factor b, which has at least d generators, where d is the minimal number of generators of the group g. we shall consider special case when a passive group of w is a perfect group. since we obtain a direct product of n the copies of the group b then according to corollary . of j. wiegold d d + n . more exact upper bound give us theorem a., which use s a the size of the smallest simple image of g. according to the theorem a. for all suciently large n the following estimation d clogsn holds, where c is a constant. therefore, in this case our upper bound has form: d clogs + d + d. now we consider no regular wreath product, where active group can be both as innite as nite and consider a center of such group. let x = {x, x, , xn} be a-space. if an non faithfully action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of a from direct product bn then we have not standard wreath product b that is semidirect product of a and q xix b that is an and the following proposition holds. let k = ker that is subgroup of a that acts on x as a pointwise stabilizer, that is kernel of action of a on x. proposition a center of the group b is normal closure of diagonal of z i.e. )), trivial an element, and z) e. other words z b) = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, z ez z, where h z and k = ker. indeed the elements of form (; h, h, , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjuga- tion of any element from a because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of bn does not change it. also h commutate with any element of base of b because h from center of b. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, then its kernel k = e. example. if a = z then a center z b) = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, nze : h z. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. generating set for commutator subgroup , where zn, zm have presentation in additive form, is the following: h = , h = , , , hn = . thus, it consist of n tableaux of form hi = and

the mebius band the following geometric objects and actions of dieomorphisms were considered by maksymenko s. we are going to investigate an algebraic structure and generators of one group of such type. let m be a smooth compact connected surface, p be either the real line or the circle, f : m p be a smooth map, and o be the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group di ) of dieomorphisms of m. assume that at each of its critical point the map f is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial in two variables without multiple factors. conversely, every group obtained in the way describe above is isomorphic to g for some smooth map f : m p. now we specify the object and the construction of orbits under the action the group of dieomorphisms. let f : m r be a morse function on a connected compact surface m, and s and o be respectively the stabilizer and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of dieomorphisms d. let xf the partition of m whose elements are connected components of level-sets f of f. an element g xf is called critical if it contains a critical point of f, otherwise, g is regular. it is well known that the factor space m/xf has a natural structure of a nite graph, called kronrod-reeb graph. in our case, the dieomorphisms act on the mebius band. let m be a compact not orientable surface and be a volume from m that h form of mebius band. for a smooth map f : m r denote by s the subgroup d of dieomorphisms h of m preserving f, i.e. satisfying the relation f h = f. this group is associated with sid a subgroup of stabilizer elements isotopic to the identity, namely sid, last isomorphism arises due to locally trivial bun- dle. since there is locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid then an exact sequence of homotopic groups and locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups give an explanation of isomorphism sid . this lo- cally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid induce an exact sequence of homotopic groups of bundle. since the group of dieomorphisms is innitely dimensional, we have the connected components. this group is associated with the action of group s/sid on splitting into function level lines f. in our case the morse function on m has two local extreme which are points of local maximum. moreover, the morse function f has critical sets with one saddle point. lines of levels around a local maximum point of f has form of coaxial circles these lines are determined by polynomial of form +c. lines of levels of f around a sadle point of f has form of hyperbolic curve and these lines are determined by the following homogeneous polynomial plus constant x y + c. more precisely, we consider the function of morse f on m that has the following properties: f is constant on the bound m, it has points of maximum at a saddle point, at these points of maximum, the values of the function are equal; in every critical point of f the germ of f is cequivalent to some homogeneous polynomial of real variables without multiple factors. let f : m r be a cmorse function. since the polynomial + c is homogeneous and has no multiple factors, it follows from morse lemma that the space of all morse maps belongs to the space of maps f, where f has only isolated critical points and p be either a real line r or a circle s let d be a group of dieomorphisms preserving morse function f on m , then ) z. let on m are n identical regions xi , having for example the form of doubles, where f has critical points in each xi also xi are domains of simple connectedness. consider a group h of automorphisms of m which are induced by the action of dieomorphisms h of a group d such that preserving the mebius function f, that is, such h are from the stabilizer s d. generators of their stabilizers by right action by dieomorphisms s are i. generators of cyclic group z, dening a shift, is . since the group action is continuously then can realize only cyclic shift, without changing the domains of simplicity xi order. let there are n critical sets xi on m. the automorphism group h has too subgroups z which corresponds to rotation of m with all critical sets xi without changing order of xi and n is the subgroup of automorphisms of n critical sets. analogously to investigations of there is short exact sequence zm z , where g-group of automorphisms reebs graph and of is orbit under action of dieomorphism group, as a result of such an action, a surjective epimorphism to a group z, which has left inverse and arises as well as splitting. therefore, the automorphism group has the structure of a semi-direct product n z as it also was shown by maksymenko s. in the similar case for another group and set . moreover, this morse function f has critical sets xi on mebius band with one saddle point. the minimal set of generators for the fundamental group of the orbit of the function f with respect to the action of the group of dieomorphisms of non-moving on m is found in the next theorem. since the action of the group of dieomorphisms on n-critical sets of m are determined and described above, then the considered by us group has the correspondent to this action structure zn. denote by h the fundamental group the rst generator is it realizes shift of mebius band and second realize rotation of domains xi of simple connectedness on mebius band when passing through the twisting point of mebius band . other wodrs acting by automorphism by permutation of sheets of doubles xi with winding of outer adjacency on each doubles xi. thus, i has innite order. bounds of these domains are line of level of function f on these domains, viz the such sets of points, where f = const we shall prove that relation is true. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in aut. let us prove that relation is true. theorem the group h zn = , with dened above homomorphism in autzn has two generators and non trivial relations nn = , iijj = jjii, < i, j < n. also this group admits another presentation in generators and relations , , , n i = i+ , ij = ji, i, j n . according to described above action we have that the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in the autzn. there exists such difeomsrphism from d, that calls dehn twist, which has innite order becase it makes winding of outer adjacency on this doubles xi, and it belongs to stabilizer s. thus generator corresponds to this difeomsrphism. let xi denote the number of domain xi. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism = , where = . also the action could be represented as = [ +n n ]modn), , [ +nk n ]xmodn, , [ n]xmodnxn). we extend the action of onto arbitrary z. this action is sequential shifts of xi along orbit on m dened by . = [ +n n ]modn), , [ +nk n ]xmodn, , [ n]xmodnxn). consider two sets. first set are = , , , n, for instance = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = , also the numbers m n such that  m+n n  = and the numbers that are congruent to these m by modulo n. second set are = , , , , n + also the numbers that are congruent to these by modulo n, for instance if = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = hence, z, = l is a number of shifts dened by , i corresponds to action of automorphism by permutation with winding of outer adjacency on this doubles xi. thus, i has innite order due to dehn twist. a value of sign of the xi means the presence of a rotation of doubles or its absence. relations in non minimal generating set is the following , , , n i = i+ . it yields that the relations in the minimal generating set , are following: nn = , || = || = , = . where = and due to relation nin = i+ we transform our minimal generating set in canonical generat- ing set of n + element , , , , n. as well known the generators of semidirect product g h can be presented in form , we make use this form. the generators of zn has form of vector = , = , . . . , n = . using operation of conju- gation of = = by = , where h is one of generators of zn and g is generator of z, we express the second generator of zn. = . analogously = , = . we shall to show that there are not else independent relations in h. in the group h all canonical words has form k s s sn n . this form follows from form of a semidirect product elements. we prove that using relation from and reductions of reciprocals elements we transform any nite non trivial word of fn+ to form . also we shall prove that set of all words which maps in trivial by surjective homomorphism with a kernel that is normal closure of relations set r from are coincides with trivial words in the group . for this goal we shall to prove transformation equivalence i = i+ in fact, i = i = . also the relation ij = ji holds because automorphisms of xi an xj are indepen- dent of each other. therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , , n}. we shall to show that normal closure of relations i = i+, ij = ji determines the kernel of surjective homomorphism from fn+ to the group h. the images of such mapping are canonical words which are form h. the form of canonical words are deter- mined by the semidirect product zn and its automorphisms. this mapping has form xp j xp j xp j xpm jm k s s sn n , where xji fn+, xp j xp j xp j xpm jm fn+, n p i= si + k = m p l= pl. for this goal we use transformation equivalence i = i+ therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , , n}. more precisely, this conversion is written as imodn = imodn = modn. the kernel of surjective homomorphism contains exactly that words that after mapping becomes in trivial words in group h because trivial words in h has form n. an arbitrary word from ker can be transformed due to in i i in n , where ik = for all k. in fact ker is nor- mal closure of relations , then it consist of words i i+, . the word i i+ transforms due to to i+ i+ thus, the words from normal closure has zero sum of powers of each generator. in real group h with reduced canonical words k s s sn n , where all generators have in- nite order only words with zero exponents of generators are trivial. therefore we found all relations. the main property of homomorphism from fn+ onto h holds due to this trans- formation too. consider = = (xp j xp j xpm jm ) (xq i xq i xqm im ) = k s s sn n m j j jn n = k+m f f fn n . thus, main property of homomorphism holds. such relation nn = is typical for wreath product. since there homomrphism from the group z into the group autzn which determines a shift of generators of zn can be presented by the matrix , which for case n = has form = , and generators of subgroup zn can be presented in form of vectors , , , . to check the relation for n = we consider = . thus, = e and our relation nn = holds. the group of such kind arises as fundamental group of orbit for some morse function f, which described above, on mebius band m . so we derived the relation nn = if we multiply it from left on then we express nn = e. also we multiply it from the right on n thus we obtain the result n = n. such a relation characterizes bauslag-soliter group, that is, the group g having the form g = a, b; abma = bk , where m, k z. but bauslag-soliter group has only one relation. according to the criterion of almost fp- approximability of groups for n = m, the group g is almost fp-approximable for any prime number p. corollary a center of the group h = zn is a normal closure of sets: diagonal of zn, trivial an element and kernel of action by conjugation that is generated by n . other words z = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, nz e, where h, g z. thus, z nz z. since the action is dened by conjugation and relation nin = i holds then the element n commutates with every i. so subgroup stabilize all xi of z-space m. other words subgroup nbelongs to kernel of action . besides the element (; h, h, , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from h because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of zn does not change it. we generalize result of meldrum because, we consider not only permutation wreath product groups, and a group a can acts on a set x not faithfully b). recall that action is faithful if for every g g exists x from g-space x such that xg = x. we consider wreath product with no regular action of active group z. let x = {x, x, , xn} be z-space. if an action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of z from direct product zn then we have not standard wreath product z that is semidirect product of z and q xix z that is zn and the following corollary holds. corollary a center of the group zn z consists of normal closure of diagonal of zn, trivial an element, and kernel of action by conjugation that is nz. other words z = ; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, enz z, where h, g z, z nz z. the prove is immediately follows from corollary and kernel of action of . then stabilizer of action on z-space x = {x, x, , xn} is subgroup nz. also in kernel of action is elements from diagonal of zn. if g = z xm z xn z, where | xm |= m, | xn |= n then the action is dened by shift on nite set xn, |x| = n is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. the action is dened by shift on nite set xm is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to mz. also in kernel of action is elements from diagonal of znm that is isomorphic to z. thus its center z nz mz z. remark. a center of a group of form zn b generates by normal closure of: diagonal of bn, trivial an element, and nz x e.","The author presents a strengthened previous result, introducing a new class of wreathcyclic groups constructed using a formula. These groups involve semidirect products and have a structure isomorphic to fundamental orbital groups of a Morse function. The multiplication rule for automorphisms is introduced, along with rooted and directed automorphisms. The text explores the structure of wreath products using tableau presentations and generators, along with commutators and commutator widths. The focus then shifts to geometric groups of dieomorphisms acting on a Mebius band, deriving a group structure with generators and relations. The concept of canonical generating sets and establishing relations for minimal generating sets is discussed. The group action and associated homomorphisms are detailed, emphasizing the transformation of canonical words. The text concludes with the study of center groups and kernels of actions in wreath product groups, highlighting the relationship between center groups and diagonal elements."

"in this work the previous result of the author is strengthen also there is considered new class of wreathcyclic groups which constructed by formula: g = ( n j= ckj) ( n j= ckj) . . .

of the form  k q i= gi n z. last group is isomorphic to one of the fundamental orbital groups of of the morse function f. namely, . consider the group h = n j= cij, where orders ij of all cij are mutually coprime for j > and a number of cyclic factors in wreath product is nite. we call such group h by wreathcyclic. the multiplication rule of automorphisms g, h which is presented in form of the

construct generating set of ci ci cim, where active group in the left. denote by lcm = lcm least common multiplier of orders also by i, i, , im, lcmk = lcm. we make use of presentation of wreath

canonical set of generators for wreath product of cp cp cp was used by v. sushanskyy in also it was used by us in . this set has form = , = , , n = . we split such table in sections with respect to i-th section corresponds to portrait of at i-th level. also the rst section corresponds to an active group and to crown of wreath product g, the second section is separated with a semicolon to a base of wreath product. the sections of the base of wreath product are divided into parts by semicolon too and these parts correspond to groups cij which form the base of wreath product. the l-th section of of a tableau presentation of automorphism corresponds to portrait of automorphism on level xl. the portrait of automorphisms on level xl is characterized by the sequence , where coordinate of l is vertex number of unique non trivial v.p. on xl, the sequence has iiil coordinates. therefore, our rst generator has form = that is the rooted automorphism, second has form = e; , e, e, , e | {z } i ;

b = is generator of g i.e. it is -base of g. the generator generate the group which is isomorphic to the group of all -th coordinate tableaux that is . by the same principle we obtain = lcm = e; e, e,

coordinate tableaux that is i+ . by the same principle we can express all i of our canonical generating set. if it were a self-similar group, then it would be more usefull to present it in terms of wreath recursion, as the set where is the rooted automorphism. given a permutational representation of cij we can present our group by wreath recursion. we present by wreath recursion as = . it would

described above in theorem in case = are mutually coprime and = are mutually coprime, then we group generator and in vector that is rst generator of direct product ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl). therefore rst generator of g has form and the second generator has form of vector . the generator has a similar structure. to express the generator of canonical set from , we exponent to lcm analogously k = lcmk. generators of commutator and commutator width of wreath product let us nd upper bound of generators number for g. more generally, let a be a group and b a permutation group, i.e. a group a acting on a set x (active group a can acts not faithfully). consider the set all pairs {, f : x h, a a}. a product on this set is dened by { := (aa, ff a )}, where f a = f). theorem if w = , where |x| = n, |y | = m and is active group acting on x, then d d + d + d. proof. generating set of generators in form of tableaux for w : ai = , t = , , tk = , tl = , where hj, cjl sb, b = sb, ai sa, a = sa. let orbits of an action a on x are {oj}jj. note that, on a each coordinate of tableau, that presents a commutator of and , a a, b b it can be product of form aaa a a and higah abg aba b, this should satisfy the following condition: n y ioj higah abg aba b, j j. viz the product of coordinate of wreath product base is an element of commutator b. as it was described above it is subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with additional condition . it is just the case because not all element of this subdirect product are independent, since even one element have to be chosen in such way in order that holds. if we rearrange all factors in product in the following way: n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) b. where is a commutator in case cw = we express this element from b as commutator if cw = in general case instead of this element we have cw q j= . this commutator are formed as product of commutators of rearranged elements of n q i= higah abg aba we can generate it by generators of form that is in our generating set. therefore, we have a direct product of n the copies of the group b and the multiplier cw q j= from b, which has at least d generators n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) cw y j= b. since ( n q i= higih i g i ) = e and the product cw q j= belongs to b, then condition holds. the assertion of a theorem on a recursive principle is easily generalized on multiple wreath product of groups. then we have direct product of n factors of group b and one factor b, which has at least d generators, where d is the minimal number of generators of the group g. we shall consider special case when a passive group of w is a perfect group. since we obtain a direct product of n the copies of the group b then according to corollary . of j. wiegold d d + n . more exact upper bound give us theorem a., which use s a the size of the smallest simple image of g. therefore, in this case our upper bound has form: d clogs + d + d. now we consider no regular wreath product, where active group can be both as innite as nite and consider a center of such group. let x = {x, x, , xn} be a-space. if an non faithfully action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of a from direct product bn then we have not standard wreath product b that is semidirect product of a and q xix b that is an and the following proposition holds. let k = ker that is subgroup of a that acts on x as a pointwise stabilizer, that is kernel of action of a on x. proposition a center of the group b is direct product of normal closure of center of diagonal of z i.e. )), trivial an element, and intersection of e with z. other words z b) = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, z e k) z), where h z. indeed the elements of form (; h, h, , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjuga- tion of any element from a because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of bn does not change it. also h commutate with any element of base of b because h from center of b. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, then its kernel k = e. example. if a = z then a center z b) = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, nze : h z). since the action dened by shift on nite set x is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. generating set for commutator subgroup , where zn, zm have presentation in additive form, is the following: h = , h = , , , hn = . thus, it consist of n tableaux of form hi = and relations for coordinate of any tableau hi, i {, , n } is hi + + hin according to theorem for wreath product of abelian groups which presented in multi- plicative form this relation has form n y i= hifiah iabf iab a = n y i= (hifiah iabf iab a i+ y j=i+  hj, fja  ) = e. example. let g = zn zm is standard wreath product, then d = n application to geometric groups of dieomorphisms act- ing on the mebius band the following geometric objects and actions of dieomorphisms were considered by maksymenko s. we are going to investigate an algebraic structure and generators of one group of such type. let m be a smooth compact connected surface, p be either the real line or the circle, f : m p be a smooth map, and o be the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group di ) of dieomorphisms of m. assume that at each of its critical point the map f is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial in two variables without multiple factors. conversely, every group obtained in the way describe above is isomorphic to g for some smooth map f : m p. now we specify the object and the construction of orbits under the action the group of dieomorphisms. let f : m r be a morse function on a connected compact surface m, and s and o be respectively the stabilizer and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of dieomorphisms d. let xf the partition of m whose elements are connected components of level-sets f of f. an element g xf is called critical if it contains a critical point of f, otherwise, g is regular. it is well known that the factor space m/xf has a natural structure of a nite graph, called kronrod-reeb graph. in our case, the dieomorphisms act on the mebius band. let m be a compact not orientable surface and be a volume from m that h form of mebius band. for a smooth map f : m r denote by s the subgroup d of dieomorphisms h of m preserving f, i.e. satisfying the relation f h = f. this group is associated with sid a subgroup of stabilizer elements isotopic to the identity, namely sid, last isomorphism arises due to locally trivial bun- dle. since there is locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid then an exact sequence of homotopic groups and locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups give an explanation of isomorphism sid . this lo- cally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid induce an exact sequence of homotopic groups of bundle. since the group of dieomorphisms is innitely dimensional, we have the connected components. this group is associated with the action of group s/sid on splitting into function level lines f. in our case the morse function on m has two local extreme which are points of local maximum. moreover, the morse function f has critical sets with one saddle point. lines of levels around a local maximum point of f has form of coaxial circles these lines are determined by polynomial of form + c. more precisely, we consider the function of morse f on m that has the following properties: f is constant on the bound m, it has points of maximum at a saddle point, at these points of maximum, the values of the function are equal; in every critical point of f the germ of f is cequivalent to some homogeneous polynomial of real variables without multiple factors. let f : m r be a cmorse function. since the polynomial + c is homogeneous and has no multiple factors, it follows from morse lemma that the space of all morse maps belongs to the space of maps f, where f has only isolated critical points and p be either a real line r or a circle s let d be a group of dieomorphisms preserving morse function f on m , then ) z. let on m are n identical regions xi , having for example the form of doubles, where f has critical points in each xi also xi are domains of simple connectedness. consider a group h of automorphisms of m which are induced by the action of dieomorphisms h of a group d such that preserving the mebius function f, that is, such h are from the stabilizer s d. generators of their stabilizers by right action by dieomorphisms s are i. generators of cyclic group z, dening a shift, is . since the group action is continuously then can realize only cyclic shift, without changing the domains of simplicity xi order. let there are n critical sets xi on m. the automorphism group h has too subgroups z which corresponds to rotation of m with all critical sets xi without changing order of xi and n is the subgroup of automorphisms of n critical sets. analogously to investigations of there is short exact sequence zm z , where g-group of automorphisms reebs graph and of is orbit under action of dieomorphism group, as a result of such an action, a surjective epimorphism to a group z, which has left inverse and arises as well as splitting. therefore, the automorphism group has the structure of a semi-direct product n z as it also was shown by maksymenko s. in the similar case for another group and set . moreover, this morse function f has critical sets xi on mebius band with one saddle point. the minimal set of generators for the fundamental group of the orbit of the function f with respect to the action of the group of dieomorphisms of non-moving on m is found in the next theorem. since the action of the group of dieomorphisms on n-critical sets of m are determined and described above, then the considered by us group has the correspondent to this action structure zn. denote by h the fundamental group the rst generator is it realizes shift of mebius band and second realize rotation of domains xi of simple connectedness on mebius band when passing through the twisting point of mebius band . other wodrs acting by automorphism by permutation of sheets of doubles xi with winding of outer adjacency on each doubles xi. thus, i has innite order. bounds of these domains are line of level of function f on these domains, viz the such sets of points, where f = const we shall prove that relation is true. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in aut. let us prove that relation is true. theorem the group h zn = , with dened above homomorphism in autzn has two generators and non trivial relations nn = , iijj = jjii, < i, j < n. also this group admits another presentation in generators and relations , , , n i = i+ , ij = ji, i, j n . according to described above action we have that the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in the autzn. there exists such difeomsrphism from d, that calls dehn twist, which has innite order becase it makes winding of outer adjacency on this doubles xi, and it belongs to stabilizer s. thus generator corresponds to this difeomsrphism. let xi denote the number of domain xi. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism = , where = . also the action could be represented as = [ +n n ]modn), , [ +nk n ]xmodn, , [ n]xmodnxn). we extend the action of onto arbitrary z. this action is sequential shifts of xi along orbit on m dened by . = [ +n n ]modn), , [ +nk n ]xmodn, , [ n]xmodnxn). consider two sets. first set are = , , , n, for instance = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = , also the numbers m n such that  m+n n  = and the numbers that are congruent to these m by modulo n. second set are = , , , , n + also the numbers that are congruent to these by modulo n, for instance if = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = hence, z, = l is a number of shifts dened by , i corresponds to action of automorphism by permutation with winding of outer adjacency on this doubles xi. thus, i has innite order due to dehn twist. a value of sign of the xi means the presence of a rotation of doubles or its absence. relations in non minimal generating set is the following , , , n i = i+ . it yields that the relations in the minimal generating set , are following: nn = , || = || = , = . where = and due to relation nin = i+ we transform our minimal generating set in canonical generat- ing set of n + element , , , , n. as well known the generators of semidirect product g h can be presented in form , we make use this form. the generators of zn has form of vector = , = , . . . , n = . using operation of conju- gation of = = by = , where h is one of generators of zn and g is generator of z, we express the second generator of zn. = . analogously = , = . we shall to show that there are not else independent relations in h. in the group h all canonical words has form k s s sn n . this form follows from form of a semidirect product elements. we prove that using relation from and reductions of reciprocals elements we transform any nite non trivial word of fn+ to form . also we shall prove that set of all words which maps in trivial by surjective homomorphism with a kernel that is normal closure of relations set r from are coincides with trivial words in the group . for this goal we shall to prove transformation equivalence i = i+ in fact, i = i = . also the relation ij = ji holds because automorphisms of xi an xj are indepen- dent of each other. therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , , n}. we shall to show that normal closure of relations i = i+, ij = ji determines the kernel of surjective homomorphism from fn+ to the group h. the images of such mapping are canonical words which are form h. the form of canonical words are deter- mined by the semidirect product zn and its automorphisms. this mapping has form xp j xp j xp j xpm jm k s s sn n , where xji fn+, xp j xp j xp j xpm jm fn+, n p i= si + k = m p l= pl. for this goal we use transformation equivalence i = i+ therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , , n}. more precisely, this conversion is written as imodn = imodn = modn. the kernel of surjective homomorphism contains exactly that words that after mapping becomes in trivial words in group h because trivial words in h has form n. an arbitrary word from ker can be transformed due to in i i in n , where ik = for all k. in fact ker is nor- mal closure of relations , then it consist of words i i+, . the word i i+ transforms due to to i+ i+ thus, the words from normal closure has zero sum of powers of each generator. in real group h with reduced canonical words k s s sn n , where all generators have in- nite order only words with zero exponents of generators are trivial. therefore we found all relations. the main property of homomorphism from fn+ onto h holds due to this trans- formation too. consider = = (xp j xp j xpm jm ) (xq i xq i xqm im ) = k s s sn n m j j jn n = k+m f f fn n . thus, main property of homomorphism holds. such relation nn = is typical for wreath product. since there homomrphism from the group z into the group autzn which determines a shift of generators of zn can be presented by the matrix , which for case n = has form = , and generators of subgroup zn can be presented in form of vectors , , , . to check the relation for n = we consider = . thus, = e and our relation nn = holds. the group of such kind arises as fundamental group of orbit for some morse function f, which described above, on mebius band m . so we derived the relation nn = if we multiply it from left on then we express nn = e. also we multiply it from the right on n thus we obtain the result n = n. such a relation characterizes bauslag-soliter group, that is, the group g having the form g = a, b; abma = bk , where m, k z. but bauslag-soliter group has only one relation. according to the criterion of almost fp- approximability of groups for n = m, the group g is almost fp-approximable for any prime number p. corollary a center of the group h = zn is a normal closure of sets: diagonal of zn, trivial an element and kernel of action by conjugation that is generated by n . other words z = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, nz e, where h, g z. thus, z nz z. since the action is dened by conjugation and relation nin = i holds then the element n commutates with every i. so subgroup stabilize all xi of z-space m. other words subgroup nbelongs to kernel of action . besides the element (; h, h, , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from h because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of zn does not change it. we generalize result of meldrum because, we consider not only permutation wreath product groups, and a group a can acts on a set x not faithfully b). recall that action is faithful if for every g g exists x from g-space x such that xg = x. we consider wreath product with no regular action of active group z. let x = {x, x, , xn} be z-space. if an action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of z from direct product zn then we have not standard wreath product z that is semidirect product of z and q xix z that is zn and the following corollary holds. corollary a center of the group zn z consists of normal closure of diagonal of zn, trivial an element, and kernel of action by conjugation that is nz. other words z = ; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, enz z, where h, g z, z nz z. the prove is immediately follows from corollary and kernel of action of . then stabilizer of action on z-space x = {x, x, , xn} is subgroup nz. also in kernel of action is elements from diagonal of zn. if g = z xm z xn z, where | xm |= m, | xn |= n then the action is dened by shift on nite set xn, |x| = n is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. the action is dened by shift on nite set xm is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to mz. also in kernel of action is elements from diagonal of znm that is isomorphic to z. thus its center z nz mz z. remark. a center of a group of form zn b generates by normal closure of: center of diagonal of bn, trivial an element, and nz x e.","The section discusses strengthening previous results by considering a new class of wreathcyclic

"a dieomorphism h : m m is said to be f-preserving whenever f h = f. this is equivalent to the assumption that h is invariant each level-set, f , c p, of f, where p be either the real line r or the circle s we denote by d the minimal number of generators of the group g . let g be a group. the commutator width of g , cw is dened to be the least integer n, such that every element of g is a product of at most n commutators if such an integer exists, and cw = otherwise. the rst example of a nite perfect group with cw > was presented by isaacs . commutator widths for both groups and of elements has proven to be an important property. in particular, its connections with stable commutator length and bounded cohomology has become signicant. one form of commutators of the wreath product a b was shortly considered by meldrum . for more deep description of this form we take into account the commutator width ) which was presented in work of muranov . this form of commutators of wreath product has been used here to consider cw, cw and cw . the form of commutator presentation has been given here in the form of wreath recursion and additionally its commutator width has been studied. the subtree of x induced by the set of vertices k i=xi is denoted by x . the restriction of the action of an automorphism g autxto the subtree x is denoted by g|x. a restriction g|x is called the vertex permutation of g in a vertex v.","A f-diffeomorphism h : M → M is f-preserving if fh = f, meaning h is invariant on level sets of function f.

"we will make use of both rooted and directed automorphisms which were introduced by grigorchuk . denition an automorphism of t is rooted if all of its vertex permutations that correspond to non-empty words are trivial. we let l = xxx be an innite ray in t. denition if all vertex permutations along the ray l and all vertex permutations which correspond to vertices whose distance to the ray l is at least are trivial, then we say that the automorphism g of t is directed along l and we will call l the spine of g . , , ,k , , ,n ,n+ ,n+ ,n ,nm+ ,nm+ ,k+ ,kn ,nm+m+ ,nm+m ,nml+ml+ , nml+ml+l , , ,k ,, ,n ,kn ,n+ ,n fig. directed automorhism fig. rooted automorhism it should be noted that because we consider only truncated trees and truncated automorphisms here and for convenience, we will say rooted automorphism instead of truncated rooted automorphism. theorem if orders of cyclic groups cni, cnj are mutually coprime i = j, then the group g = ci ci cim admits two generators , proof. construct the generators of n j= cij as a rooted automorphism and a directed automor- phism along a path l on a rooted labeled truncated tree tx. we consider the group g = ci ci cim. construct the generating set of ci ci cim, where the active group is on the left. denote by lcm = lcm the least common multiplier of the orders by i, i, . . . , im and denote lcmk = lcm similarly. we make use of a presentation of those wreath product elements from a tableaux of kaloujnine . this has the form = also we use subgroup of tableau of length n which has form = . the tableaux which has rst n trivial coordinates was denoted in by = . the canonical set of generators for the wreath product of cp cp cp was used by sushanskyy and additionally utilised by the author . this set has form = , = , . . . , n = . we split such a table into sections with respect to , where the i-th section corresponds to portrait of at i-th level. the rst section corresponds to an active group and the crown of wreath product g, the second section is separated with a semicolon to a base of the wreath product. the sections of the base of wreath product are divided into parts by semicolon and these parts correspond to groups cij which form the base of wreath product. the l-th section of of a tableau presentation of automorphism corresponds to portrait of automorphism on level xl. the portrait of automorphisms on level xl is characterised by the sequence , where coordinate l is the vertex number of unique non trivial v.p. on xl, the sequence has ii . . . il coordinates. therefore, our rst generator has the form = , which is the rooted automor- phism. the second generator has the form = e; , e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; ii z }| { e, e, . . . , e | {z } i , , e, . . . , e; ii+i z }| { e, . . . , e, , e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e, . . . , e , it should be noted that after the last semicolon there are iii + ii + i trivial coordinates. there are iiii + iii + ii + i trivial coordinates before (or in other words after the fth semicolon but before ). in a section after k semicolon the coordinate of a non- trivial element k is calculated in a similar way. we know from that is generator of g, i.e. -base of g. recall that g calls k-th base of g. the subgroup g is a subgroup of all tableaux of form u with u g. let cn = nand set = we have to show that our generating set {, } generates the whole canonical generating set. for this, we obtain the second new generator in form of the tableau lcm = lcm = e; lcm , e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; e, e, . . . , e | {z } ii ; e, e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e, . . . , e . because ord = i and = , we nd that the element lcm is generator of ci since ord = ord(lcm ). we obtain that =  lcm lcm , which corresponds to generator of canonical generating set . observe that b = is generator of g, i.e. it is precisely a -base of g. it is known that the generator precisely generates the group that is isomorphic to the group for all -nd coordinate tableaux. from the same principle, one can obtain that = lcm = e; e, e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; ii z }| { e, e, . . . , e | {z } i , lcm , e, . . . , e; ii z }| { e, . . . , e, e, e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e . . . e . this generator generates the group which is isomorphic to the group of all -th coordinate tableaux which is i+ . by the same principle we can express all i of our canonical generating set. if it were a self-similar group, then it would be more useful to present it in terms of wreath recursion, as the set where is the rooted automorphism. given a permutational representation of cij we can present our group by wreath recursion. we present by wreath recursion as = . it would be written in form lcm = lcm = (lcm, lcm, e, e, . . . , e) = , e, e, . . . , e), since ord = i and = then the element lcm is generator of ci too, because ord = ord(lcm ). then we obtain the second generator of canonical generating set by exponentiation  lcm lcm = . since we have obtain = , then we can express =   , e, . . . , e  , where is a state of consider an alternative recursive constructed generating set consisting of nested automorphism states that are , ,. . . ,m and the automorphism the state is expressed as follows = . a second generator of a recursive generating set also could be constructed in an other way = i = (i, i, e, e, . . . , e) = (e, i, . . . , e, e). where is the state in a vertex of the second level x then we express the next state of by multiplying = . therefore by a recursive approach we obtain = and analogously we get lcm = lcm =  lcm , e, . . . , e  . similarly, we obtain lcmk k = lcmk k =  lcmk k , e, . . . , e  and k =  lcmk k lcm k = . thus, the k-th generator of recursive generating set could be expressed as follows k k = . the last generator of our generating set has another structure m = which concludes the proof. let n j= cij be generated by and and m l= ckl = , denote by |g| an order of g. theorem if = and = or = and = , then there exists generating set of elements for the wreath-cyclic group g = ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl), where ij are orders of cij. proof. the generators and are directed automorphisms, , are rooted automorphisms . the structure of tableaux are described above in theorem in case = are mutually coprime and = are mutually coprime, then we group generator and in vector that is rst generator of direct product ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl). therefore, the rst generator of g has form and the second generator has form of vector . the generator has a similar structure. to express the generator of canonical set from , we exponent to lcm analogously, k = lcmk which concludes the proof.","The text discusses rooted and directed automorphisms introduced by Grigorchuk, focusing on the definitions and properties of these automorphisms. A rooted automorphism has trivial vertex permutations for non-empty words, while a directed automorphism is along a specific ray with trivial vertex permutations. The text also explores constructing generating sets for groups using rooted and directed automorphisms, as well as presenting these groups using tableaux and wreath recursion. The proof involves demonstrating how to generate wreath-cyclic groups with specific conditions on orders using directed and rooted automorphisms as generators."
"let us nd upper bound of generators number for g. let a be a group and b a permutation group, i.e. a group a acting on a set x . consider the set of all pairs {, f : x h, a a}. a product on this set is dened by { := (aa, ff a )}, where f a = f). theorem if w = , where |x| = n, |y | = m and is active group acting on x, then d d + d + d. proof. the generating set of generators in form of tableaux for w : ai = , t = , . . . , tk = , tl = , where hj, cjl sb, b = sb, ai sa, a = sa. let orbits of an action a on x are {oj}jj. note that, on a each coordinate of tableau, that presents a commutator of and , a a, b b it can be product of form aaa a a and higah abg aba b, this should satisfy the following condition: n y ioj higah abg aba b, j j. that is to say that the product of coordinates of wreath product base is an element of commutator b. as it was described above it is subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition . this is the case because not all element of the subdirect product are independent because the elements must be chosen in such a way that holds. we may rearrange the factors in the product in the following way: n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) b. where is a commutator in case cw = we express this element from b as commutator if cw = in the general case, we would have cw q j= instead of this element. this commutator are formed as product of commutators of rearranged elements of n q i= higah abg aba therefore, we have a subdirect product of n the copies of the group b which has been equipped by condition . the multiplier cw q j= from b, which has at least d generators n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) cw y j= b. since ( n q i= higih i g i ) = e and the product cw q j= belongs to b, then condition holds. the assertion of a theorem on a recursive principle is easily generalised on multiple wreath product of groups. thus minimal total amount consists of at least d generators for n factors of group b, d generators for the dependent factor from b and d generators of the group a which concludes the proof. we shall consider special case when a passive group of w is a perfect group. since we obtain a direct product of n the copies of the group b then according to corollary . of wiegold d d + n . more exact upper bound give us theorem a. , which use s a the size of the smallest simple image of g. therefore, in this case our upper bound has the form d clogsn + d + d. now we consider no regular wreath product, where active group can be both as innite as nite and consider a centre of such group. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be a-space. if an non faithfully action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of a from direct product bn then we have not standard wreath product b that is semidirect product of a and q xix b that is an and the following proposition holds. let k = ker that is subgroup of a that acts on x as a pointwise stabiliser, that is kernel of action of a on x. proposition a centre of the group b is direct product of normal closure of centre of diagonal of z i.e. )), trivial an element, and intersection of e with z. in other words, z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, z e k) z), where h z. proof. indeed the elements of form (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from a because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of bn does not change it. also h commutate with any element of base of b because h from centre of b. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, then its kernel k = e which conrms the proposition. example if a = z then a centre z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nze : h z). since the action dened by shift on nite set x is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. generating set for commutator subgroup , where zn, zm have presentation in additive form, is the following: h = , h = , . . . hn = . thus, it consist of n tableaux of form hi = and relations for coordinate of any tableau hi, i {, . . . , n } is hi + + hin according to theorem for wreath product of abelian groups which presented in multiplicative form this relation has form n y i= hifia h iab f iab a = n y i= (hifia h iab f iab a i+ y j=i+  hj, fja  ) = e. example let g = zn zm is standard wreath product, then d = n example the quotient group of restricted wreath products g = , |x| = n, |y | = m by commutator has the structure z z, whose number of commutator generators is bounded by d + d, where b = is the group acting by shift. the minimal generating set of the quotient group g/g has one generator if = in previous conditions if g = a b then, g/g = a/a b/b. proof. consider the construction of element of g = a b, where |x| = n, |y | = m, where a = , b = then elements of commutator has form: , where hi b. the commutator of g satises to condition: n y i= higah abg aba = e, where a a, b b, gi, hj b. thus, this group is a subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition where since for any element from the subgroup of coordinates there exists a surjective homomorphism on b hence g is subdirect product. the commutator with shifted coordinate thai is higah abg aba, appears on i-th coordinate due to action of a. the condition appears because of corollary from the set of elements that satisfy of condition or equivalent condition for abelian case n q i= high g = e form commutator. the commutator is the kernel of homomorphism from g = g/g z/z z/z = z z. this homomorphism maps elements of g which satisfy n q i= hi = e in e of the group g/g. to show an injectivity and surjectivity of homomorphism we chose elements of form from g, where h / g it corresponds to specimen of quotient group g/g and to quotient group b/b. so we have one to one correspondence. in case of the action of z on the n elements in the set is isomorphic to the action of zn elements on this set or the action of the zn elements on itself. because of not all the elements of this subdirect product is independent, at least one we have to choose so that would be executed. this implies that the estimation d d + d. in this case, g/g a/a b/b or more precisely g/g . for the group g = znzm the same is true with g/g and dependently of fact of = or not can admits one or two generators. for the group g = zn zm it should be noted that the same is true. in the general case, n i= zmi can have only one generator more than the quotient by commutator has. application to geometric groups of dieomorphisms acting on the m obius band the following geometric objects and actions of dieomorphisms on it were considered by maksymenko s. we are going to investigate an algebraic structure and generators of one group of such type. let m be a smooth compact connected surface, p be either the real line or the circle, f : m p be a smooth map, and o be the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group di ) of dieomorphisms of m. assume that at each of its critical point the map f is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial in two variables without multiple factors. conversely, every group obtained in the way describe above is isomorphic to g for some smooth map f : m p. now we specify the object and the construction of orbits under the action the group of dieomorphisms. let f : m r be a morse function on a connected compact surface m, and s and o (we label it as of) be respectively the stabiliser and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of dieomorphisms d. let xf the partition of m whose elements are connected components of level-sets f of f. an element g xf is called critical if it contains a critical point of f, otherwise, g is regular. it is well known that the factor space m/xf has a natural structure of a nite graph, called kronrod-reeb graph. in our case, the dieomorphisms act on the m obius band. let m be a compact not orientable surface and be a volume from m that h form of m obius band. for a smooth map f : m r denote by s the subgroup d of dieomorphisms h of m preserving f, i.e. satisfying the relation f h = f. this group is associated with sid a subgroup of stabiliser elements isotopic to the identity, namely sid, last isomorphism arises due to locally trivial bundle. since there is locally triv- ial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid then an exact sequence of homotopic groups and locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups give an explanation of isomorphism sid . this locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid induce an exact sequence of homotopic groups of bundle. since the group of dieomorphisms is innitely dimensional, we have the connected components. this group is associated with the action of group s sid on splitting into function level lines f. in our case the morse function on m has two local extreme which are points of local maximum. moreover, the morse function f has critical sets with one saddle point. lines of levels around a local maximum point of f has form of coaxial circles these lines are determined by polynomial of form + c. more precisely, we consider the function of morse f on m that has the following properties: f is constant on the bound m, it has points of maximum at a saddle point, at these points of maximum, the values of the function are equal; in every critical point of f the germ of f is cequivalent to some homogeneous polynomial of real variables without multiple factors. let f : m r be a cmorse function. since the polynomial + c is homogeneous and has no multiple factors, it follows from morse lemma that the space of all morse maps belongs to the space of maps f, where f has only isolated critical points and p be either a real line r or a circle s let d be a group of dieomorphisms preserving morse function f on m , then ) z. let on m are n identical regions xi , having for example the form of doubles, where f has critical points in each xi also xi are domains of simple connectedness. consider a group h of automorphisms of m which are induced by the action of dieomorphisms h of a group d such that preserving the m obius function f, that is, such h are from the stabiliser s d. generators of their stabilisers by right action by dieomorphisms s are i. generators of cyclic group z, dening a shift, is . since the group action is continuously then can realize only cyclic shift, without changing the domains of simplicity xi order. let there are n critical sets xi on m. the automorphism group h has too subgroups z which corresponds to rotation of m with all critical sets xi without changing order of xi and n is the subgroup of automorphisms of n critical sets. analogously to investigations of there is short exact sequence zm z , where g-group of automorphisms reebs graph and of is orbit under action of dieomorphism group, as a result of such an action, a surjective epimorphism to a group z, which has left inverse and arises as well as splitting. therefore, the automorphism group has the structure of a semi-direct product n z as it also was shown by maksymenko s. in the similar case for another group and set . moreover, this morse function f has critical sets xi on m obius band with one saddle point. the minimal set of generators for the fundamental group of the orbit of the function f with respect to the action of the group of dieomorphisms of non-moving on m is found in the next theorem. since the action of the group of dieomorphisms on n-critical sets of m are determined and described above, then the considered by us group has the correspondent to this action structure zn. denote by h the fundamental group the rst generator is it realises shift of m obius band and second realize rotation of domains xi of simple connectedness on m obius band when passing through the twisting point of m obius band . other words acting by automorphism by permutation of sheets of doubles xi with winding of outer adjacency on each doubles xi. thus, i has innite order. bounds of these domains are line of level of function f on these domains, viz the such sets of points, where f = const we shall prove that relation is true. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in aut. let us prove that relation is true. theorem the group h zn = , with dened above homomorphism in autzn has two generators and non trivial relations nn = , iijj = jjii, < i, j < n. also this group admits another presentation in generators and relations , , . . . , n i = i+ , ij = ji, i, j n . proof. according to described above action we have that the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in the autzn. there exists such dieomorphism from d, that calls dehn twist, which has innite order because it makes winding of outer adjacency on this doubles xi, and it belongs to stabiliser s. thus generator corresponds to this dieomorphism. let xi denote the number of domain xi. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism = , where = . also the action could be represented as = [ +n n ]modn), . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, , . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). we extend the action of onto arbitrary z. this action is sequential shifts of xi along orbit on m dened by . = [ +n n ]modn), . . . . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). consider two sets. first set are = , , . . . , n, for instance = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = , also the numbers m n such that  m+n n  = and the numbers that are congruent to these m by modulo n. second set are = , , , . . . , n + also the numbers that are congruent to these by modulo n, for instance if = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = hence, z, = l is a number of shifts dened by , i corresponds to action of automorphism by permutation with winding of outer adjacency (dehn twist ) on this doubles xi. thus, i has innite order due to dehn twist. a value of sign of the xi means the presence of a rotation of doubles or its absence. relations in non minimal generating set is the following , , . . . , n i = i+ . it yields that the relations in the minimal generating set , are following: nn = , || = || = , = . where = and due to relation nin = i+ we transform our minimal generating set in canonical generating set of n+ element , , , . . . , n. as well known the generators of semidirect product g h can be presented in form , we make use this form. the generators of zn has form of vector = , = , , n = . using operation of conjugation of = = by = , where h is one of generators of zn and g is generator of z, we express the second generator of zn. = . analogously = , = . we shall to show that there are not else independent relations in h. in the group h all canonical words has form k s s . . . sn n . this form follows from form of a semidirect product elements. we prove that using relation from and reductions of reciprocals elements we transform any nite non trivial word of fn+ to form . also we shall prove that set of all words which maps in trivial by surjective homomorphism with a kernel that is normal closure of relations set r from are coincides with trivial words in the group . for this goal we shall to prove transformation equivalence i = i+ in fact, i = i = . also the relation ij = ji holds because automorphisms of xi an xj are independent of each other. therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. we shall to show that normal closure of relations i = i+, ij = ji determines the kernel of surjective homomorphism from fn+ to the group h. the images of such mapping are canonical words which are form h. the form of canonical words are determined by the semidirect product zn and its automorphisms. this mapping has form xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm k s s . . . sn n , where xji fn+, xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm fn+, n p i= si + k = m p l= pl. for this goal we use transformation equivalence i = i+ therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. more precisely, this conversion is written as imodn = imodn = modn. the kernel of surjective homomorphism contains exactly that words that after mapping becomes in trivial words in group h because trivial words in h has form . . . n. an arbitrary word from ker can be transformed due to in i i . . . in n , where ik = for all k. in fact ker is normal closure of relations , then it consist of words i i+, . the word i i+ transforms due to to i+ i+ thus, the words from normal closure has zero sum of powers of each generator. in real group h with reduced canonical words k s s . . . sn n , where all generators have innite order only words with zero exponents of generators are trivial. therefore, we found all relations which concludes the proof. the main property of homomorphism from fn+ onto h holds due to this transformation too. consider, = =  xp j xp j . . . xpm jm   xq i xq i . . . xqm im  = k s s . . . sn n m j j . . . jn n = k+m f f . . . fn n thus, the main property of homomorphism holds. it should be noted that such a relation nn = is typical for a wreath product. since there homomorphism from the group z into the group autzn which determines a shift of generators of zn can be presented by the matrix , which for case n = has form = , and generators of subgroup zn can be presented in form of vectors. these vectors are precisely , , . . . , . to check the relation for n = we consider = . thus, = e and our relation nn = holds completing the proof. the group of such kind arises as fundamental group of orbit for some morse function f, which described above, on m obius band m . so we derived the relation nn = if we multiply it from left on then we express nn = e. also we multiply it from the right on n thus we obtain the result n = n. such a relation charac- terises bauslag-soliter group, that is, the group g having the form g = a, b; abma = bk , where m, k z. but bauslag-soliter group has only one relation. corollary a centre of the group h = zn is a normal closure of sets: diagonal of zn, trivial an element and kernel of action by conjugation that is generated by n . in other words, z = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nz e, where h, g z. thus, z nzz. since the action is dened by conjugation and relation nin = i holds then the element n commutates with every i. so subgroup stabilise all xi of z-space m. other words subgroup nbelongs to kernel of action . besides the element (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from h because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of zn does not change it. we generalise result of meldrum because, we consider not only permutation wreath product groups, and a group a can acts on a set x not faithfully b). recall that action is faithful if for every g g exists x from g-space x such that xg = x. we consider wreath product with no regular action of active group z. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be z-space. if an action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of z from direct product zn then we have not standard wreath product z that is semidirect product of z and q xix z that is zn and the following corollary holds. corollary the centre of the group zn z consists of normal closure of the diagonal of zn, a trivial element and the kernel of action by conjugation, i.e. nz. in other words, z = ; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, enz z, where h, g z, z nz z. proof. the proof follows immediately from corollary by utilising the kernel of action of . the stabiliser of an action over z-space x = {x, x, . . . , xn} is subgroup nz. additionally, the kernel of action has elements from the diagonal of zn. if g = z xm z xn z, where | xm |= m, | xn |= n then the action is dened by shift on nite set xn, |x| = n is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. the action is dened by shift on nite set xm is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to mz. also in kernel of action is elements from diagonal of znm that is isomorphic to z. thus its centre z nz mz z. remark a centre of a group of form zn b generates by normal closure of: centre of diagonal of bn, trivial an element, and nz x e.","The text discusses the generation of the commutator subgroup of a wreath product group. It explores the upper bounds on the number of generators for a group consisting of an active group acting on a set. The focus is on determining the generators for commutator subgroups based on circular shifts and actions of automorphisms. The work also applies these concepts to geometric groups of diffeomorphisms on the Möbius band, analyzing the structure and generators of such groups. The presentation goes into detail about the construction of orbits under the actions of the group of diffeomorphisms, considering Morse functions and critical sets on compact surfaces. The main results include establishing generators and relations for the fundamental groups of orbits under specific group actions. Additionally, it discusses the relation to Bauslag-Soliter groups and provides a generalization of results from previous studies. Finally, the text extends the analysis to non-regular wreath products and centers of such groups based on the kernel of actions by conjugation."

"we denote by d the minimal number of generators of the group g . a dieomorphism h : m m is said to be f-preserving if f h = f. this is equivalent to the assumption that h is invariant each level-set, i.e. f , c p of f, where p denotes either the real line r or the circle s . let g be a group. the commutator width of g , denoted cw, is dened to be the least integer n, such that every element of g is a product of at most n commutators if such an integer exists, and otherwise is cw = . the rst example of a nite perfect group with cw > was presented by isaacs i. . the property of commutator widths for groups and elements has proven to be important and in particular, its connections with stable commutator length and bounded cohomology has become signicant. meldrum j. briey considered one form of commutators of the wreath product ab. in order to obtain a more detailed description of this form, we take into account the commutator width ) as presented in work of muranov a. . sk) and cw . the form of commutator presentation has been given here in the form of wreath recursion and additionally, its commutator width has been studied. the subtree of x which is induced by the set of vertices k i=xi is denoted by x. denote the restriction of the action of an automorphism g autxto the subtree x by g|x. it should be noted that a restriction g|x is called the vertex permutation of g in a vertex v.","The text introduces the concept of commutator width in group theory, denoted as cw.

"this work strengthens previous results by the author and will additionally consider a new class of groups. this class is precisely the wreath-cyclic groups and will be denoted by . let g , then this class is constructed by formula: g = ( n j= ckj ) ( n j= ckj ) ( nl jl= ckjl ), kji < , ni < , where the orders of cij are denoted by ij. it should be noted that at the end of this product, a semidirect product could arise with a given homomor- phism , which is dened by a free action on the set z. in other words, one would obtain a group of the form  k q i= gi n z. note that the last group here is isomorphic to one of the fundamental orbital groups of of the morse function f. namely, we have . consider now the group h = n j= cij, whose orders ij for all cij are mutually coprime for all j > and whose number of cyclic factors in the wreath product is nite. we will call such group h wreath-cyclic. note that the multiplication rule of automorphisms g, h which are presented in the form of wreath recursion g = , g, . . . , g)g, h = , h, . . . , h)h, is given precisely by the formula: g h = , ghg, . . . , gdhg)gh. in the general case, if an active group is not cyclic, then the cycle decomposition of an n-tuple for auto- morphism sections will induce the corresponding decomposition of the g. if is v.p of automorphism g at vij and all the vertex permutations below vij are trivial, then we do not distinguish from the section gvij of g which is dened by it. that is to say, we can write gvij = = g as proposed by bartholdi l., grigorchuk r. and suni z. .","The text discusses the construction of a new class of groups known as wreath-cyclic groups, denoted by .

"let us nd upper bound of generators number for g. let a be a group and b a permutation group, i.e. a group a acting upon a set x, where the active group a can act not faithfully. consider the set of all pairs {, f : x h, a a}. we dene a product on this set as { := (aa, ff a )}, where f a = f). theorem if w = , where |x| = n, |y | = m and active group a acts on x transitively, then d d + d + d. proof. the generators of w in form of tableaux : ai = , t = , . . . , tk = , tl = , where hj, cjl sb, b = sb, ai sa, a = sa. note that, on a each coordinate of tableau, that presents a commutator of and , a, b a, hi, gj b can be product of form aaa a a and higah abg aba b, according to corollary . this products should satisfy the following condition: n y ix higah abg aba b.j that is to say that the product of coordinates of wreath product base is an element of commutator b. as it was described above it is subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition . this is the case because not all element of the subdirect product are independent because the elements must be chosen in such a way that holds. we may rearrange the factors in the product in the following way: n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) b. where is a commutator in case cw = we express this element from b as commutator if cw = in the general case, we would have cw q j= instead of this element. this commutator are formed as product of commutators of rearranged elements of n q i= higah abg aba therefore, we have a subdirect product of n the copies of the group b which has been equipped by condition . the multiplier cw q j= from b, which has at least d generators n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) cw y j= b. since ( n q i= higih i g i ) = e and the product cw q j= belongs to b, then condition holds. the assertion of a theorem on a recursive principle is easily generalized on multiple wreath product of groups. thus minimal total amount consists of at least d generators for n factors of group b, d generators for the dependent factor from b and d generators of the group a which concludes the proof. it should be noted that not all the elements of commutator subgroup, that has structure of the subdirect product, are independent by , at least one of them must be chosen carefully such that would be satised. this implies the estimation d d + d. thus minimal total amount consists of at least d generators for n factors of group b, d generators for the dependent factor from b and d generators of the group a which concludes the proof. we shall consider special case when a passive group of w is a perfect group. since we obtain a direct product of n the copies of the group b then according to corollary . of wiegold j. d d + n . more exact upper bound give us theorem a. , which use s a the size of the smallest simple image of g. where c is a constant. n same perfect groups then dn) < d + + logsn, where s = ord where h is minimal prime non abelian group, which is image of g . therefore, in this case our upper bound has the form d clogsn + d + d. now we consider no regular wreath product, where active group can be both as innite as nite and consider a centre of such group. this is generalization of theorem from the book because action of a is not non faithfully. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be a-space. if an non faithfully action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of b from direct product bn then we have not standard wreath product b that is semidirect product of a and q xix b that is an and the following proposition holds. let k = ker that is subgroup of a that acts on x as a pointwise stabiliser, that is kernel of action of a on x. denote by z( ) the subgroup of diagonal subgroup fun) of functions f : x z which are constant on each orbit of action of a on x for unrestricted wreath product, and denote by z) the subgroup of diagonal fun) of functions with the same property for restricted wreath product, where n is number of non-trivial coordinates in base of wreath product. proposition a centre of the group b is direct product of normal closure of centre of a diagonal of z i.e. )), trivial an element, and intersection of e with z. in other words, z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, z e k) z), where h z, |x| = n. for restricted wreath product with n non-trivial coordinate: z b) = , e, z e k) z). in case of unrestricted wreath product we have: z b) = , e, z e k) z( ). proof. the elements of center subgroup have to satisfy the condition: f : x b such is constant on each orbit oj of action a on x i.e. f = bi for any x oj. also every bx: bx z. indeed the elements of form (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from a because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of bn does not change it. also h commutes with any element of base of b because h from centre of b. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, then its kernel k = e which conrms the proposition. also elements of subgroup e) belongs to z b) iit acts trivial on x. example if a = z then a centre z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nze : h z). since the action dened by shift on nite set x is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. nbelongs to kernel of action . generating set for commutator subgroup , where zn, zm have presentation in additive form, is the following: h = , h = , . . . hn = . thus, it consist of n tableaux of form hi = and relations for coordinate of any tableau hi, i {, . . . , n } is hi + + hin according to theorem , for wreath product of abelian groups presented in multiplicative form, this relation has the form n y i= hifia h iab f iab a = n y i= (hifia h iab f iab a i+ y j=i+  hj, fja  ) = e. example if g = zn zm is standard wreath product, then d = n let g = z x z and g = a x b be a restricted wreath product, where only n non-trivial elements in coordinates of base of wreath product which are indexed by elements from x, in degenerated case | x |= n. z acts on x by left shift. also a acts transitively from left. remark the quotient group of a restricted wreath products g = z x z by a commutator subgroup is isomorphic to z z. in previous conditions if g = a x b then, g/g = a/a b/b. if g = zn zm, where = , then d = if g = z z is an unrestricted regular wreath product then g/g z e z. proof. consider the element of g = a x b, where a can be z which acts on x by left shift, then elements of commutator subgroup has form: , where hi b. according to corollary the commutator of elements h = , g = , g, h g satises the condition , which for case where b is abelian such: n q i= higah abg aba = e, where gi, hi are non trivial coordinates from base of group, a, b a, gi, hj b. the commutator with the shifted coordinate higah abg aba appears within the i-th coordinate position due to action of a. according to corollary the set of elements satisfying condition forms a commutator. also the equivalent condition can be formulated: n y i= higih i g i b, therefore, if b is abelian an element h of g belongs to g ih satisfy a condition: n q i= hi = e. for unrestricted wreath product to show that all base of wreath product is in the commutator subgroup we choose an element , where hi is variable, and form a commutator which is an arbitrary element of wreath product base: [e; . . . , h , h , h , . . .] = . for convenience we present z in additive form. then to previous equality holds the following equations have to be satised: h h = g, h h = , h h = , . it implies that h = h , h = h, h = h, hi+ = hi. therefore hi = , i from other side we have hh = g, hh = , hh = , . so hi = g, for all i < that is impossible in the restricted case but possible in the unrestricted. as a corollary g/g z z for restricted case. thus, for unrestricted case all base of g is in g as a corollary g z e. after, we see that in case of restricted wreath product we not always can chose hi such that a corresponded product n q i= gi of form belongs to base of g, in this case b = z so z = e. thus, this group is a subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition where, because for any element of the subgroup of coordinates there exists a surjective homomorphism acting upon b, we can conclude that g must be a subdirect product. the commutator subgroup is the kernel of homomorphism : g g/g. more precisely, g = g/g z/z z/z = z z. in case g = a b the ker has the same structure, the homomorphism maps those elements of bn, as base of g, which satisfy n q i= hi = e, i.e. the elements of b in e of the group g/g. thus, ker = g. to show that the properties of injectivity and surjectivity hold for this homomorphism, we chose the elements from g which have the form , where h / g, corresponding to a specimen from the quotient group b/b. also we chose independently, an element of the form corresponding to a specimen of the quotient group a/a. therefore, we must have a one-to-one correspondence between g/g and a/a b/b. in this case, we obtain g/g a/a b/b . in the scenario when the action of z upon the n elements from the set is isomorphic to the action of zn elements on the set or the action of the zn elements on itself. in case g = z z we have g/g . for the group g = zn zm the same is true with g/g and dependently of fact of = or not can admits one or two generators. for the group g = zn zm it should be noted that the same is true. in the general case, n i= zmi can have only one generator more than the quotient by commutator has. application to geometric groups of dieomorphisms acting on the m obius band maksymenko s. studied various dierent geometric objects and considered the actions of dieomor- phisms on them. we now consider the algebraic structure and the generators for a group of such type. let m be a smooth compact connected surface, p be either the real line or the circle, f : m p be a smooth map, and o be the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group di) of dieomorphisms of m. we assume that at each critical point, the map f is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial in two variables without multiple factors. conversely, it should be noted that every group obtained in the way described will be isomorphic to g for some smooth map f : m p. we will now specify the object and the construction of orbits under the action of the group dieomorphisms. let f : m r be a morse function on a connected compact surface m. let s and of = o be the stabiliser and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of dieomorphisms d respectively. let xf denote the partition of m whose elements are the connected components of level-sets f of f. it should be noted here that an element g xf is called critical if it contains a critical point of f, otherwise, the elements is called regular. it is well known within this research domain that the factor space m/xf, has a natural structure of a nite graph and is entitled the kronrod-reeb graph. in our case, the dieomorphisms act upon the m obius band. let m now be a compact not orientable surface and be a volume from m which has h-form of the m obius band. for a smooth map f : m r, denote by s, the subgroup d of dieomorphisms h which preserve f, i.e. those satisfying the relation f h = f. this group is associated with sid, which is a subgroup of stabiliser elements isotopic to the identity, i.e. sid, where the last isomorphism arises due to locally trivial bundle. because there are a locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid , this means that an exact sequence of homotopic groups and locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups give an explanation of the isomorphism sid . this locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups induce an exact sequence of homotopic groups of that bundle. now since the group of dieomorphisms is innitely dimensional, we have found the connected components. this group is associated with the action of the group s sid upon splitting into the function level lines f. in our case, the morse function upon m has two local extremes, which are the points of local maximum. moreover, the morse function f must have critical sets with exactly one saddle point. the lines of levels around a local maximum point of f have the form of coaxial circles, where these lines are determined by the polynomial with form + c. determined by the following homogeneous polynomial plus constant x y + c. being a little more precise, we will now consider the function of morse f on m, which satises the following three properties: f is constant on the bound m; there are two points of maximum at a saddle point; at the two points of maximum, the values of the function are equal, i.e. at every critical point of f, the germ of f is cequivalent to some homogeneous polynomial in two real variables without multiple factors. let f : m r now be a cmorse function. connected was described by maksymeko we note here that since the polynomial + c is homogeneous and has no multiple factors, it follows (from the celebrated morse lemma) that the space of all morse maps belongs to the space of maps f, where f here only has isolated critical points and p is either the real line r or the circle s let d be a group of dieomorphisms which preserve the morse function f on m. we know from the results of maksymenko s. that ) z. let there exist upon m, n identical regions xi (critical sets) which have, for example, the form of doubles, meaning that f has two critical points in each xi and additionally, that xi are the domains of simple connectedness. consider a group h of automorphisms of m which are induced by the action of dieomorphisms h of a group d which preserve the m obius function f. in other words, the h here are from the stabiliser s d. we note that the generators with stabilisers with the right action by dieomorphisms s are i. the generators of the cyclic group z which dene a shift are . since the group action is continuous, this implies that the can realize only cyclic shifts, else one would change the domains of simplicity xi order. assume there are n critical sets xi on m. the automorphism group h has exactly two subgroups z which correspond to the rotation of m, whose critical sets xi have not changed the order of xi and n denotes the subgroup of automorphisms of n critical sets. analogously to previous investigations , there exists a short exact sequence zm z , where the g-group of automorphisms are reebs graph and hence of is an orbit under action of dieomorphism group. the application of such an action results in a surjective epimorphism to a group z, which has the left inverse and arises as a result of splitting. the automorphism group therefore has the structure of a semi-direct product n z. this is in agreement with the work of maksymenko s. who considers a similar scenario but for a dierent group and set . moreover, we note that this morse function f has critical sets xi on m obius band with one saddle point. the minimal set of generators for the fundamental group of the orbit of the function f with respect to the action of the group of dieomorphisms of non-moving m is found in the next theorem. we note that since the action of the group of dieomorphisms on n-critical sets of m have been determined and described, the next thing to be considered is how this group has the correspondent to this action structure zn. we will denote by h, the fundamental group the rst generator is since it realises the shift of the m obius band. the second, , realises the rotation of domains xi of simple connectedness upon the m obius band when passing through its twisting point. in other words, acts by the automorphism by permutation of sheets of doubles xi with the winding of outer adjacency on each double xi. thus, we conclude that i has innite order. bounds on these domains are the lines of levels of function f upon these domains, or in other words, the sets of points with f = const we shall now prove that the action of the rst generator of the group denes the homomorphism in aut.. theorem the group h zn = , with dened above homomorphism in autzn has two generators and non trivial relations nn = , iijj = jjii, < i, j < n. also this group admits another presentation in generators and relations , , . . . , n i = i+ , ij = ji, i, j n . proof. from the description above, we have that the action of the rst generator of the group, , denes the homomorphism in the aut. there exists such a dieomorphism from d, called the dehn twist, which has an innite order since it makes a winding of outer adjacency on the doubles xi, and it belongs to stabiliser s. the generator must therefore correspond to this dieomorphism. let xi denote the number of domains from xi. the action of the rst generator , denes the homomorphism = , where = . it should be noted that this action could be equivalently represented as = [ +n n ]modn), . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). we extend the action of onto an arbitrary z. this action involves sequential shifts of xi along the orbit on m dened as . we have = [ +n n ]modn), . . . . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). we will now consider two sets. the rst set is = {, , . . . , n}. as an example, if = , then we have  +n n  =  +n n  = additionally, we nd the numbers m n such that  m+n n  = and the numbers that are congruent to these m modulo n. the second set is = {, , , . . . , n+}. similarly, we note that congruence modulo n is of interest. as an example, if = , then we have  +n n  =  +n n  = hence, z, = l is the number of shifts dened by , while i corresponds to the action of automorphism by permutation with winding of outer adjacency on the doubles xi. we conclude that i therefore has an innite order due to the dehn twist. the value of the sign of the xi indicates the presence of a rotation of the doubles or its absence. the relations for the non-minimal generating set is precisely , , . . . , n i = i+ . this formulation yields that the relations for the minimal generating set is , are nn = , || = || = , = , where = and since nin = i+ we transform our minimal generating set into a canonical generating set of the n + elements given by , , , . . . , n. it is known that the generators of the semidirect product g h may be presented in the form . we now utilise this form to say that the generators of zn have the form of vectors = , = , ??, n = . making us of the operation of conjugation for = = , allows us to express the second generator of zn. note that this is by = , where h is one of generators of zn and g is generator of z. = . analogously, we nd = , and, for a general term, we nd = . word from fn due to conjugation by we can transform it to form canonocal form. we show that there are not otherwise independent relations within the group h. for this group h, all canonical words have the form k s s . . . sn n . this form follows from the form of semidirect product elements. we now prove using and reductions of reciprocals elements, that we may transform any nite non-trivial word of fn+ to the form . additionally, we shall prove that the set of all words which maps trivially by a surjective homomorphism, with a kernel which is a normal closure of relations from the set r from , are those coincides with trivial words in the group . for this purpose, we prove the transformation equivalence i = i+ in fact, i = i = . it should be noted that the relation ij = ji holds since automorphisms of xi and xj are independent of each other. therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all the to be in the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. we will show that normal closure of the relations i = i+, with ij = ji, determines the kernel of the surjective homomorphism from fn+ to h. the images of such a mapping are the canonical words which have the form of h. the form of these canonical words are determined by the semidirect product zn and its automorphisms. this mapping has the form xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm k s s . . . sn n , where xji fn+, xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm fn+ and n p i= si + k = m p l= pl. for this purpose, we use the transformation equivalence i = i+ making use this transformation allows us to therefore rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. being a little more precise, this conversion is expressed as i = i = . the kernel of surjective homomorphism contains exactly those words that, after mapping, becomes the trivial words in the group h since those trivial words have the form . . . n. note that an arbitrary word from ker may be transformed due to into i i . . . in n , where ik = for all k. in fact, ker is the normal closure of the relations and hence it consist of the words i i+, with . in particular, the word i i+ transforms by to i+ i+ the words from the normal closure must therefore have zero sum of powers for each generator. in the real group h, with the reduced canonical words , where all generators have innite order, only those words with zero exponents of generators are trivial. we have therefore found all such relations. which concludes the proof. it should be noted that the main property of the homomorphism , from fn+ onto h, holds due to the same transformation . we now consider = =  xp j xp j . . . xpm jm   xq i xq i . . . xqm im  = k s s . . . sn n m j j . . . jn n = k+m f f . . . fn n thus, the main property of the homomorphism holds. it should be noted that such a relation nn = is typical for a wreath product. the homomorphism from the group z into the group autzn, determining a shift of generators of zn, can be equivalently presented by the matrix . for the case n = , has the form = . the generators of the subgroup zn can be presented in the form of vectors. these vectors are precisely , , . . . , . in order to check the relation for the case n = , we consider = . thus, = e and our relation nn = holds. it should be noted that the research of maksymenko s. tells us that a group of this kind arises as a fundamental group of the orbit for some morse function f which, as described above, acts upon the m obius band m. note that we have derived the relation nn = . if we now multiply this from left on , we can equivalently express this as nn = e. in a similar fashion, the multiplication from the right on n obtains n = n. one such relation characterises the bauslag-soliter group. this is the group g, which has the form g = a, b; abma = bk , where m, k z. note the bauslag-soliter group has only one relation. z which is elements multiple of n because we make a reduction by mod n. corollary a centre of the group h = zn is a normal closure of sets: diagonal of zn, trivial an element and kernel of action by conjugation that is generated by n . in other words, z = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nz e, where h, g z. thus, z nzz. since the action is dened by conjugation and relation nin = i holds then the element n commutates with every i. so subgroup stabilise all xi of z-space m. other words subgroup nbelongs to kernel of action . besides the element (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from h because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of zn does not change it. we can generalise a result of meldrum j. because we consider not only the permutation wreath product groups, but the group a does not have to act upon the set x faithfully, hence b. a group and b recall that an action is said to be faithful if for every g g, there exists x from g-space x such that xg = x. we consider wreath products with no regular actions of the active group z. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be the z-space. if an action by conjugation determines a shift of the copies of z from the direct product zn then, we have not found a standard wreath product z which is a semidirect product of z and q xix z, i.e. zn. thus, we observe the following corollary holds. corollary the centre of the group zn z consists of normal closure of the diagonal of zn, a trivial element and the kernel of action by conjugation, i.e. nz. in other words, z = ; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, enz z, where h, g z, z nz z. proof. the proof follows immediately from corollary by utilising the kernel of action of . the stabiliser of such an action over the z-space x = {x, x, . . . , xn} is the subgroup nz. additionally, the kernel of this action has elements from the diagonal of zn. it should be noted, if we have g = z xm z xn z, where |xm| = m and |xn| = n, then the action is dened by the shift upon nite set xn. in this case, we nd that |x| = n is not faithful and its kernel is also isomorphic to nz since the cyclic shift on the n coordinates is invariant on x. note that the action is dened by the shift on the nite set xm is not faithful and its kernel is isomorphic to mz. additionally, within this kernel of action is the elements from the diagonal of znm which are isomorphic to z. thus, its centre is z nz mz z which concludes the proof. remark the centre of a group of the form zn b generates, by normal closure of: centre of diagonal of bn, trivial an element, and nz x e.","The

vertex v. commutator subgroup and center of wreath product with non- faithful action in this work, we strengthen and continue the previous results of the author and will additionally consider a new class of groups. this class is precisely the wreath-cyclic groups and will be denoted by . let g , then this class is constructed by formula: g = ( n j= ckj ) ( n j= ckj ) ( nl jl= ckjl ), kji < , ni < , where the orders of cij are denoted by ij. it should be noted that at the end of this product, a semidirect product could arise with a given homomor- phism , which is dened by a free action on the set z. in other words, one would obtain a group of the form  k q i= gi n z. note that the last group here is isomorphic to one of the fundamental orbital groups of of the morse function f. namely, we have . consider now the group h = n j= cij, whose orders ij for all cij are mutually coprime for all j > and whose number of cyclic factors in the wreath product is nite. we will call such group h wreath-cyclic. note that the multiplication rule of automorphisms g, h which are presented in the form of wreath recursion g = , g, . . . , g)g, h = , h, . . . , h)h, is given precisely by the

a rooted automorphism and a directed automor- phism along a path l on a rooted labeled truncated tree tx. we consider the group g = ci ci cim. construct the generating set of ci ci cim, where the active group is on the left. denote by lcm = lcm the least common multiplier of the orders by i, i, . . . , im. in a similar fashion, we denote lcmk = lcm similarly. we utilise a presentation of those wreath product elements from a tableaux of kaloujnine l. which has the form = . additionally, we use a subgroup of tableau with length n which has the form = . the tableaux which has rst n trivial coordinates was denoted in by = . the canonical set of generators for the wreath product of cp cp cp was used by dmitruk y. and sushchanskii v. and additionally utilised by the author . this set has form = , = , . . . , n = . we split such a table into sections with respect to , where the i-th section corresponds to portrait of at i-th level. the rst section corresponds to an active group and the crown of wreath product g, the second section is separated with a semicolon to a base of the wreath product. the sections of the base of wreath product are divided into parts by semicolon and these parts correspond to groups cij which form the base of wreath product. the l-th section of of a tableau presentation of automorphism corresponds to portrait of automorphism on level xl. the portrait of automorphisms on level xl is characterised by the sequence , where coordinate l is the vertex number of unique non trivial v.p on xl, the sequence has ii . . . il coordinates. therefore, our rst generator has the form = , which is the rooted automorphism. the second generator has the form = e; , e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; ii z }| { e, e, . . . , e | {z } i , , e, . . . , e; ii+i z }| { e, . .

in other words after the fth semicolon but before ). in a section after k semicolon the coordinate of a non-trivial element k is calculated in a similar way. we know from that is generator of g, i.e. -base of g. recall that g calls k-th base of g. the subgroup g is a subgroup of all tableaux of form u with u g. let cn = nand set = we have to show that our generating set {, } generates the whole canonical generating set. for this, we obtain the second new generator in form of the tableau lcm = lcm = e; lcm , e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; e, e, . . . , e | {z } ii ; e, e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e, . . . , e . since ord = i and = , we nd that the element lcm is generator of ci since ord = ord(lcm ). we obtain that =  lcm lcm , which corresponds to generator of canonical generating set . observe that b = is generator of g, i.e. it is precisely a -base of g. it is known that the generator precisely generates the group that is isomorphic to the group for all -nd coordinate tableaux. from the same principle, one can obtain that = lcm = e; e, e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; ii z }| { e, e, . . . , e | {z } i , lcm , e, . . . , e; ii z }| { e, . . . , e, e, e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e . . . e . this generator generates the group which is isomorphic to the group of all -th coordinate tableaux, which is precisely i+ . making use of the same principle allows us to express all the i from our canonical generating set. note that if it were a self-similar group, then it would be more useful to present it in terms of wreath recursion, as the set where is the rooted automorphism. given a permutational representation of cij we can present our group by wreath recursion. we present by wreath recursion as = . it would be written in form lcm = lcm = (lcm, lcm, e, e, . . . , e) = , e, e, . . . , e), since ord = i and = then the element lcm is generator of ci too, because ord = ord(lcm ). we then obtain the second generator of canonical generating set by exponentiation  lcm lcm = . since we have obtained = , we can express =   , e, . . . , e  , where is a state of consider an alternative recursive constructed generating set which consists of nested automorphism states which are

i, e, e, . . . , e) = (e, i, . . . , e, e), where is the state in a vertex of the second level x we can then express the next state of by multiplying = . therefore, by a recursive approach, we obtain = and analogously we obtain lcm = lcm = (lcm , e, . . . , e). similarly, we obtain lcmk k = lcmk k =  lcmk k , e, . . . , e  and k =  lcmk k lcm k = . the k-th generator of the recursive generating set can therefore be expressed as k k = . the last generator of our generating set has another structure, namely m = which concludes the proof. let n j= cij be generated by and and m l= ckl = , denote an order of g by |g|. theorem if = and = or = and = , then there exists generating set of elements for the wreath-cyclic group g = ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl), where ij are orders of cij. proof. the generators and are directed automorphisms, , are rooted automorphisms . the structure of tableaux are described above in theorem in case = are mutually coprime and = are mutually coprime, then we group generator and in vector that is rst generator of direct product ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl). therefore, the rst generator of g has form and the second generator has form of vector . the generator has a similar structure. in order to express the generator of the canonical set from , we change the exponent from to lcm analogously, we obtain k = lcmk which concludes the proof. generators of commutator subgroup and center of a wreath product of group with a non-faithful action let us nd upper bound of generators number for g. let a be a group and b a permutation group, i.e. a group a acting upon a set x, where the active group a can act not faithfully. consider the set of all pairs {, f : x h, a a}. we dene a product on this set as { := (aa, ff a )}, where f a = f). theorem if w = , where |x| = n, |y | = m and active group a acts on x transitively, then d d + d + d. proof. the generators of w in form of tableaux : ai = , t = , . . . , tk = , tl = , where hj, cjl sb, b = sb, ai sa, a = sa. note that, on a each coordinate of tableau, that presents a commutator of and , a, b a, hi, gj b can be product of form aaa a a and higah abg aba b, according to corollary . this products should satisfy the following condition: n y ix higah abg aba b. that is to say that the product of coordinates of wreath product base is an element of commutator b. as it was described above it is subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition . this is the case because not all element of the subdirect product are independent because the elements must be chosen in such a way that holds. we may rearrange the factors in the product in the following way: n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) b. where is a commutator in case cw = we express this element from b as commutator if cw = in the general case, we would have cw q j= instead of this element. this commutator are formed as product of commutators of rearranged elements of n q i= higah abg aba therefore, we have a subdirect product of n the copies of the group b which has been equipped by condition . the multiplier cw q j= from b, which has at least d generators n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) cw y j= b. since ( n q i= higih i g i ) = e and the product cw q j= belongs to b, then condition holds. the assertion of a theorem on a recursive principle is easily generalized on multiple wreath product of groups. thus minimal total amount consists of at least d generators for n factors of group b, d generators for the dependent factor from b and d generators of the group a which concludes the proof. it should be noted that not all the elements of commutator subgroup, that has structure of the subdirect product, are independent by , at least one of them must be chosen carefully such that would be satised. this implies the estimation d d + d. thus minimal total amount consists of at least d generators for n factors of group b, d generators for the dependent factor from b and d generators of the group a which concludes the proof. we shall consider special case when a passive group of w is a perfect group. since we obtain a direct product of n the copies of the group b then according to corollary . of wiegold j. d d + n . more exact upper bound give us theorem a. , which use s a the size of the smallest simple image of g. as it were studied by j. wiegold if among group of product q n i= are n same perfect groups then dn) < d + + logsn, where s = ord where h is minimal prime non abelian group, which is image of g . therefore, in this case our upper bound has the form d clogsn + d + d. now we consider no regular wreath product, where active group can be both as innite as nite and consider a centre of such group. this is generalization of theorem from the book because action of a is not non faithfully. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be a-space. if an non faithfully action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of b from direct product bn then we have not standard wreath product b that is semidirect product of a and q xix b that is an and the following proposition holds. let k = ker that is subgroup of a that acts on x as a pointwise stabiliser, that is kernel of action of a on x. denote the set of all the orbits of a on x by o, if this set is nite then by of. recall that the direct product indexed by innite set consists of all innite sequences, and the direct sum consists only of sequences with nitely many elements distinct from zero. denote by z( ) the subgroup of diagonal subgroup fun) of functions f : x z which are constant on each orbit of action of a on x for unrestricted wreath product, and denote by z) the subgroup of diagonal fun) of functions with the same property for restricted wreath product, where n is number of non-trivial coordinates in base of wreath product. proposition a centre of the group b is direct product of normal closure of centre of a diagonal of z i.e. )), trivial an element, and intersection of e with z. in other words, z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, z e k) z), where h z, |x| = n. for restricted wreath product with n non-trivial coordinate: z b) = , e, z e k) z) l jof k) z. in case of unrestricted wreath product we have: z b) = , e, z e k) z( ) = q jo k) z. proof. the elements of center subgroup have to satisfy the condition: f : x b such is constant on each orbit oj of action a on x i.e. f = bi for any x oj. also every bx: bx z. indeed the elements of form (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from a because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of bn does not change it. also h commutes with any element of base of b because h from centre of b. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, then its kernel k = e which conrms the proposition. also elements of subgroup e) belongs to z b) iit acts trivial on x. if we have unrestricted wreath product then we show that the center z is the subgroup of elements of form satisfying the following conditions: f is constant on each orbit of a on x, i.e. f = cj for any x oj, where oj o, and cj z. a z k. by the same reasons as for nite set of non-trivial elements on x applied to oj as above it is obvious that if an element of b satises the conditions ) and ), then the element belongs to the center z wrb). on the contrary, if the element b does not satisfy one of the conditions ) or ) then there exists a a that ag = ga or g acts non trivial on xi x therefore = , where b is on xi coordinate. in case of violation of condition ) there will be no commutation on the second coordinate. example if a = z then a centre z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nze : h z). since the action dened by shift on nite set x is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. generating set for commutator subgroup , where zn, zm are presentation in additive form, is the following: h = , h = , . . . hn = . thus, it consist of n tableaux of form hi = and relations for coordinate of any tableau hi, i {, . . . , n } is hi + + hin according to theorem , for wreath product of abelian groups presented in multiplicative form, this relation has the form n y i= hifia h iab f iab a = n y i= (hifia h iab f iab a i+ y j=i+  hj, fja  ) = e. let be innite cyclic group acting on n-letters alphabet. we denote m-elements set by xm. example if g z then z nz mz z. let us prove it applying proposition we note that in case of action on nite set there is not dierence between restricted and unrestricted wreath products. our formula of centre of two groups a acting on x and b wreath product will be used by us. this formula states that zb) ker)z, where ker is kernel of acting a on x (in our such action by shifts of z on xn is not faithful, the kernel of action z on xn) in subgroup nz because of in every n shifts by cyclic the shifting point of xn returns on its initial place). in a case of the new group g z we consider two groups again z w , where w = . according to our formula in we obtain the centre z = mzz therefore it remains to calculate the centre of the rst group the kernel of its action. the kernel of action i.e. z on xn is the group nz because of the action of z on n-elements set xn has the period n. applying the formula to z w we conclude that z w) = nz mz z. the quotient g/g is z z z therefore the quotient group g/g by z is the following zn zm. thus centre z if subgroup of nite index in g = z. example if g = zn zm is standard wreath product, then d = n let g = z x z and g = a x b be a restricted wreath product, where only n non-trivial elements in coordinates of base of wreath product which are indexed by elements from x, in degenerated case | x |= n. z acts on x by left shift. also a acts transitively from left. remark the quotient group of a restricted wreath products g = z x z by a commutator subgroup is isomorphic to z z. in previous conditions if g = a x b then, g/g = a/a b/b. if g = zn zm, where = , then d = if g = z z is an unrestricted regular wreath product then g/g z e z. proof. consider the element of g = ax b, where a can be z which acts on x by left shift, then elements of commutator subgroup has form: , where hi b. according to corollary the commutator of elements h = , g = , g, h g satises the condition , which for case where b is abelian such: n q i= higah abg aba = e, where gi, hi are non trivial coordinates from base of group, a, b a, gi, hj b. the commutator with the shifted coordinate higah abg aba appears within the i-th coordinate position due to action of a. according to corollary the set of elements satisfying condition forms a commutator. also the equivalent condition can be formulated: n y i= higih i g i b, therefore, if b is abelian an element h of g belongs to g ih satisfy a condition: n q i= hi = e. for unrestricted wreath product to show that all base of wreath product is in the commutator subgroup we choose an element , where hi is variable, and form a commutator which is an arbitrary element of wreath product base: [e; . . . , h , h , h , . . .] = . for convenience we present active group in the additive form. then to previous equality holds the following equations have to be satised: h h = g, h h = , h h = , . it implies that h = h , h = h, h = h, hi + = hi. therefore hi = , i from other side we have h h = g, h h = , h h = , ., so hi = g, for all i < that is impossible in the restricted case but possible in the unrestricted. as a corollary g/g z z for restricted case. thus, for unrestricted case all base of g is in g as a corollary g/g z e. thus, this group is a subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition where, because for any element of the subgroup of coordinates there exists a surjective homomorphism acting upon b, we can conclude that g must be a subdirect product. the commutator subgroup is the kernel of homomorphism : g g/g. more precisely, g = g/g z/z z/z = z z. in case g = a b the ker has the same structure, the homomorphism maps those elements of bn, as base of g, which satisfy n q i= hi = e, i.e. the elements of b in e of the group g/g. thus, ker = g. to show that the properties of injectivity and surjectivity hold for this homomorphism, we chose the elements from g which have the form that can be generator in canonical form of generating set of wreath product , where h / g, corresponding to a a specimen from the quotient group b/b. also we chose independently, an element of the form corresponding to a specimen of the quotient group a/a. therefore, we must have a one-to-one correspondence between g/g and a/a b/b. in this case, we obtain g/g a/a b/b . the basic property of homomorphism for generators in canonical form is obviously accomplished. in the scenario when the action of z upon the n elements from the set is isomorphic to the action of zn elements on the set or the action of the zn elements on itself. in case g = z z we have g/g . for the group g = zn zm the same is true with g/g and dependently of fact of = or not can admits one or two generators. for the group g = zn zm it should be noted that the same is true. in the general case, n i= zmi can have only one generator more than the quotient by commutator has. application to geometric groups of dieomorphisms acting on the m obius band maksymenko s. studied various dierent geometric objects and considered the actions of dieomor- phisms on them. we now consider the algebraic structure and the generators for a group of such type. let m be a smooth compact connected surface, p be either the real line or the circle, f : m p be a smooth map, and o be the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group di) of dieomorphisms of m. we assume that at each critical point, the map f is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial in two variables without multiple factors. conversely, it should be noted that every group obtained in the way described will be isomorphic to g for some smooth map f : m p. we will now specify the object and the construction of orbits under the action of the group dieomorphisms. let f : m r be a morse function on a connected compact surface m. let s and of = o be the stabiliser and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of dieomorphisms d respectively. let xf denote the partition of m whose elements are the connected components of level-sets f of f. it should be noted here that an element g xf is called critical if it contains a critical point of f, otherwise, the elements is called regular. it is well known within this research domain that the factor space m/xf, has a natural structure of a nite graph and is entitled the kronrod-reeb graph. in our case, the dieomorphisms act upon the m obius band. let m now be a compact not orientable surface and be a volume from m which has h-form of the m obius band. for a smooth map f : m r, denote by s, the subgroup d of dieomorphisms h which preserve f, i.e. those satisfying the relation f h = f. this group is associated with sid, which is a subgroup of stabiliser elements isotopic to the identity, i.e. sid, where the last isomorphism arises due to locally trivial bundle. because there are a locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid , this means that an exact sequence of homotopic groups and locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups give an explanation of the isomorphism sid . this locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups induce an exact sequence of homotopic groups of that bundle. now since the group of dieomorphisms is innitely dimensional, we have found the connected components. this group is associated with the action of the group s sid upon splitting into the function level lines f. in our case, the morse function upon m has two local extremes, which are the points of local maximum. moreover, the morse function f must have critical sets with exactly one saddle point. the lines of levels around a local maximum point of f have the form of coaxial circles, where these lines are determined by the polynomial with form + c. determined by the following homogeneous polynomial plus constant x y + c. being a little more precise, we will now consider the function of morse f on m, which satises the following three properties: f is constant on the bound m; there are two points of maximum at a saddle point; at the two points of maximum, the values of the function are equal, i.e. at every critical point of f, the germ of f is cequivalent to some homogeneous polynomial in two real variables without multiple factors. let f : m r now be a cmorse function. connected was described by maksymeko we note here that since the polynomial + c is homogeneous and has no multiple factors, it follows (from the celebrated morse lemma) that the space of all morse maps belongs to the space of maps f, where f here only has isolated critical points and p is either the real line r or the circle s let d be a group of dieomorphisms which preserve the morse function f on m. we know from the results of maksymenko s. that ) z. let there exist upon m, n identical regions xi (critical sets) which have, for example, the form of doubles, meaning that f has two critical points in each xi and additionally, that xi are the domains of simple connectedness. consider a group h of automorphisms of m which are induced by the action of dieomorphisms h of a group d which preserve the m obius function f. in other words, the h here are from the stabiliser s d. we note that the generators with stabilisers with the right action by dieomorphisms s are i. the generators of the cyclic group z which dene a shift are . since the group action is continuous, this implies that the can realize only cyclic shifts, else one would change the domains of simplicity xi order. assume there are n critical sets xi on m. the automorphism group h has exactly two subgroups z which correspond to the rotation of m, whose critical sets xi have not changed the order of xi and n denotes the subgroup of automorphisms of n critical sets. analogously to previous investigations , there exists a short exact sequence zm z , where the g-group of automorphisms are reebs graph and hence of is an orbit under action of dieomorphism group. the application of such an action results in a surjective epimorphism to a group z, which has the left inverse and arises as a result of splitting. the automorphism group therefore has the structure of a semi-direct product n z. this is in agreement with the work of maksymenko s. who considers a similar scenario but for a dierent group and set . moreover, we note that this morse function f has critical sets xi on m obius band with one saddle point. the minimal set of generators for the fundamental group of the orbit of the function f with respect to the action of the group of dieomorphisms of non-moving m is found in the next theorem. we note that since the action of the group of dieomorphisms on n-critical sets of m have been determined and described, the next thing to be considered is how this group has the correspondent to this action structure zn. we will denote by h, the fundamental group the rst generator is since it realises the shift of the m obius band. the second, , realises the rotation of domains xi of simple connectedness upon the m obius band when passing through its twisting point. in other words, acts by the automorphism by permutation of sheets of doubles xi with the winding of outer adjacency on each double xi. thus, we conclude that i has innite order. bounds on these domains are the lines of levels of function f upon these domains, or in other words, the sets of points with f = const we shall now prove that the action of the rst generator of the group denes the homomorphism in aut.. theorem the group h zn = , with dened above homomorphism in autzn has two generators and non trivial relations nn = , iijj = jjii, < i, j < n. also this group admits another presentation in generators and relations , , . . . , n i = i+ , ij = ji, i, j n . proof. from the description above, we have that the action of the rst generator of the group, , denes the homomorphism in the aut. there exists such a dieomorphism from d, called the dehn twist, which has an innite order since it makes a winding of outer adjacency on the doubles xi, and it belongs to stabiliser s. the generator must therefore correspond to this dieomorphism. let xi denote the number of domains from xi. the action of the rst generator , denes the homomorphism = , where = . it should be noted that this action could be equivalently represented as = [ +n n ]modn), . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). we extend the action of onto an arbitrary z. this action involves sequential shifts of xi along the orbit on m dened as . we have = [ +n n ]modn), . . . . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). we will now consider two sets. the rst set is = {, , . . . , n}. as an example, if = , then we have  +n n  =  +n n  = additionally, we nd the numbers m n such that  m+n n  = and the numbers that are congruent to these m modulo n. the second set is = {, , , . . . , n+}. similarly, we note that congruence modulo n is of interest. as an example, if = , then we have  +n n  =  +n n  = hence, z, = l is the number of shifts dened by , while i corresponds to the action of automorphism by permutation with winding of outer adjacency on the doubles xi. we conclude that i therefore has an innite order due to the dehn twist. the value of the sign of the xi indicates the presence of a rotation of the doubles or its absence. the relations for the non-minimal generating set is precisely , , . . . , n i = i+ . this formulation yields that the relations for the minimal generating set is , are nn = , || = || = , = , where = and since nin = i+ we transform our minimal generating set into a canonical generating set of the n + elements given by , , , . . . , n. it is known that the generators of the semidirect product g h may be presented in the form . we now utilise this form to say that the generators of zn have the form of vectors = , = , ??, n = . making us of the operation of conjugation for = = , allows us to express the second generator of zn. note that this is by = , where h is one of generators of zn and g is generator of z. = . analogously, we nd = , and, for a general term, we nd = . word from fn due to conjugation by we can transform it to form canonocal form. we show that there are not otherwise independent relations within the group h. for this group h, all canonical words have the form k s s . . . sn n . this form follows from the form of semidirect product elements. we now prove using and reductions of reciprocals elements, that we may transform any nite non-trivial word of fn+ to the form . additionally, we shall prove that the set of all words which maps trivially by a surjective homomorphism, with a kernel which is a normal closure of relations from the set r from , are those coincides with trivial words in the group . for this purpose, we prove the transformation equivalence i = i+ in fact, i = i = . it should be noted that the relation ij = ji holds since automorphisms of xi and xj are independent of each other. therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all the to be in the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. we will show that normal closure of the relations i = i+, with ij = ji, determines the kernel of the surjective homomorphism from fn+ to h. the images of such a mapping are the canonical words which have the form of h. the form of these canonical words are determined by the semidirect product zn and its automorphisms. this mapping has the form xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm k s s . . . sn n , where xji fn+, xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm fn+ and n p i= si + k = m p l= pl. for this purpose, we use the transformation equivalence i = i+ making use this transformation allows us to therefore rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. being a little more precise, this conversion is expressed as i = i = . the kernel of surjective homomorphism contains exactly those words that, after mapping, becomes the trivial words in the group h since those trivial words have the form . . . n. note that an arbitrary word from ker may be transformed due to into i i . . . in n , where ik = for all k. in fact, ker is the normal closure of the relations and hence it consist of the words i i+, with . in particular, the word i i+ transforms by to i+ i+ the words from the normal closure must therefore have zero sum of powers for each generator. in the real group h, with the reduced canonical words , where all generators have innite order, only those words with zero exponents of generators are trivial. we have therefore found all such relations. which concludes the proof. it should be noted that the main property of the homomorphism , from fn+ onto h, holds due to the same transformation . we now consider = =  xp j xp j . . . xpm jm   xq i xq i . . . xqm im  = k s s . . . sn n m j j . . . jn n = k+m f f . . . fn n thus, the main property of the homomorphism holds. it should be noted that such a relation nn = is typical for a wreath product. the homomorphism from the group z into the group autzn, determining a shift of generators of zn, can be equivalently presented by the matrix . for the case n = , has the form = . the generators of the subgroup zn can be presented in the form of vectors. these vectors are precisely , , . . . , . in order to check the relation for the case n = , we consider = . thus, = e and our relation nn = holds. it should be noted that the research of maksymenko s. tells us that a group of this kind arises as a fundamental group of the orbit for some morse function f which, as described above, acts upon the m obius band m. note that we have derived the relation nn = . if we now multiply this from left on , we can equivalently express this as nn = e. in a similar fashion, the multiplication from the right on n obtains n = n. one such relation characterises the bauslag-soliter group. this is the group g, which has the form g = a, b; abma = bk , where m, k z. note the bauslag-soliter group has only one relation. z which is elements multiple of n because we make a reduction by mod n. corollary a centre of the group h = zn is a normal closure of sets: diagonal of zn, trivial an element and kernel of action by conjugation that is generated by n . in other words, z = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nz e, where h, g z. thus, z nzz. since the action is dened by conjugation and relation nin = i holds then the element n commutates with every i. so subgroup stabilise all xi of z-space m. other words subgroup nbelongs to kernel of action . besides the element (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from h because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of zn does not change it. we generalize the result of meldrum j. because we consider not only the permutation wreath product groups, but the group a does not have to act upon the set x faithfully, hence b is not regular wreath product. recall that an action is said to be faithful if for every g g, there exists x from g-space x such that xg = x. we consider wreath products with no regular actions of the active group z. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be the z-space. if an action by conjugation determines a shift of the copies of z from the direct product zn then, we have not found a standard wreath product z which is a semidirect product of z and q xix z, i.e. zn. thus, we observe the following corollary holds. corollary the centre of the group zn z consists of normal closure of the diagonal of zn, a trivial element and the kernel of action by conjugation, i.e. nz. in other words, z = ; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, enz z, where h, g z, z nz z. proof. the proof follows immediately from corollary by utilising the kernel of action of . the stabiliser of such an action over the z-space x = {x, x, . . . , xn} is the subgroup nz. additionally, the kernel of this action has elements from the diagonal of zn. it should be noted, if we have g = z xm z xn z, where |xm| = m and |xn| = n, then the action is dened by the shift upon nite set xn. in this case, we nd that |x| = n is not faithful and its kernel is also isomorphic to nz since the cyclic shift on the n coordinates is invariant on x. note that the action is dened by the shift on the nite set xm is not faithful and its kernel is isomorphic to mz. additionally, within this kernel of action is the elements from the diagonal of znm which are isomorphic to z. thus, its centre is z nz mz z which concludes the proof. remark the centre of a group of the form zn b generates, by normal closure of: centre of diagonal of bn, trivial an element, and nz x e.","The text discusses the commutator width, generating

"lucchini a. previously investigated a case of the generating set of cn p g, where g denotes a nite n-generated group, p is a prime which does not divide the order |g| and cp denotes the cyclic group of order p. the results of lucchini a. tell us that the wreath product cn p g is also n-generated. we rstly consider the active group g which is cyclic and then generalize this wreath product for both iterated wreath products and for the direct product of wreath products of cyclic groups. it should be noted that a similar question for iterated wreath product was studied by bondarenko i. . maksymenko s. has proven that the n-th homotopy groups of the orbit of f, o, with respect to the right action of the group, di, of dieomorphisms of m, coincides with those of m for n , i.e. o = , while, for the fundamental group o, it is known that it contains a free abelian subgroup arxiv:v oct of nite index. despite this, information regarding the fundamental group o remains incomplete. we provide some insight by nding the minimal generating set and its relations for the group o. all theorems and propositions are obtained and proved by the ruslan skuratovskii, corollaries and examples were obtained in collaboration with the co-author. this paper after previous arxiv versions with previous title minimal generating set and structure of wreath product of groups with non-faithful action, comutator subgroup of wreath product and the fundamental group of orbit of morse function o was published .","The section discusses the investigation on the generating set of wreath products involving a finite n-generated group with a prime order factor.

"let g be a group and let d denote its minimal number of generators . a dieomorphism h : m m is said to be f-preserving if f h = f. this is equivalent to the assumption that h is invariant each level-set, i.e. f , c p of f, where p denotes either the real line r or the circle s the commutator width of g , denoted by cw, is dened to be the least integer n, such that every element of g is a product of at most n commutators if such an integer exists, and otherwise is cw = . the rst example of a nite perfect group with cw > was presented by isaacs i. . the property of commutator widths for groups and elements has proven to be important and in particular, its connections with stable commutator length and bounded cohomology has become signicant. meldrum j. briey considered one form of commutators of the wreath product ab. in order to obtain a more detailed description of this form, we take into account the commutator width by ) as presented in work of muranov a. . sk) and cw . the form of commutator presentation has been given here in the form of wreath recursion and additionally, its commutator width has been studied. the subtree of x which is induced by the set of vertices k i=xi is denoted by x or tk. denote the restriction of the action of an automorphism g autxto the subtree x by g|x. it should be noted that a restriction g|x is called the vertex permutation of g in a vertex v. commutator subgroup and center of wreath product with non- faithful action in this work, we strengthen and continue the previous results of the author and will additionally consider a new class of groups. this class is precisely the wreath-cyclic groups and will be denoted by . let g , then this class is constructed by formula: g = ( n j= ckj ) ( n j= ckj ) ( nl jl= ckjl ), kji < , ni < , where the orders of cij are denoted by ij. it should be noted that at the end of this product, a semidirect product could arise with a given homomor- phism , which is dened by a free action on the set z. in other words, one would obtain a group of the form  k q i= gi n z. note that the last group here is isomorphic to one of the fundamental orbital groups of of the morse function f. namely, we have . consider now the group h = n j= cij, whose orders ij for all cij are mutually coprime for all j > and whose number of cyclic factors in the wreath product is nite. we will call such group h wreath-cyclic. note that the multiplication rule of automorphisms g, h which are presented in the form of wreath recursion g = , g, . . . , g)g, h = , h, . . . , h)h, is given precisely by the formula: g h = , ghg, . . . , gdhg)gh. in the general case, if an active group is not cyclic, then the cycle decomposition of an n-tuple for auto- morphism sections will induce the corresponding decomposition of the g. if is v.p of automorphism g at vij and all the vertex permutations below vij are trivial, then we do not distinguish from the section gvij of g which is dened by it. that is to say, we can write gvij = = g as proposed by bartholdi l., grigorchuk r. and suni z. . minimal generating set of direct product of wreath product of cyclic groups we now make use of both rooted and directed automorphisms as introduced by bartholdi l., grigorchuk r. and suni z. . recall that we denote a truncated tree by t. denition an automorphism of t is said to be rooted if all of its vertex permutations corresponding to non-empty words are trivial. let l = xxx be an innite ray in t. denition the automorphism g of t is said to be directed along the innite ray l if all vertex permu- tations along l and all vertex permutations corresponding to vertices whose distance to the ray l is at least two are trivial. in such case, we say that l is the spine of g . ray l is at least two are trivial, then we say that the automorphism g of t is directed along l and we will call l the spine of g . it should be noted that because we consider only truncated trees and truncated automorphisms here and for convenience, we will say rooted automorphism instead of truncated rooted automorphism. , , ,k , , ,n ,n+ ,n+ ,n ,nm+ ,nm+ ,k+ ,kn ,nm+m+ ,nm+m ,nml+ml+ , nml+ml+l , , ,k ,, ,n ,kn ,n+ ,n fig. directed automorphism fig. rooted automorphism we recall in reformulated form the result of a. woryna, about a minimal generating set of iterated wreath product. also we generalised this result after this theorem. theorem if orders of cyclic groups cni, cnj are mutually coprime i = j, then the group g = ci ci cim admits two generators, namely , proof. construct the generators of n j= cij as a rooted automorphism and a directed automor- phism along a path l on a rooted labeled truncated tree tx. we consider the group g = ci ci cim. construct the generating set of ci ci cim, where the active group is on the left. denote by lcm = lcm the least common multiplier of the orders by i, i, . . . , im. in a similar fashion, we denote lcmk = lcm similarly. we utilise a presentation of those wreath product elements from a tableaux of kaloujnine l. which has the form = . additionally, we use a subgroup of tableau with length n which has the form = . the tableaux which has rst n trivial coordinates was denoted in by = . the canonical set of generators for the wreath product of cp cp cp was used by dmitruk y. and sushchanskii v. and additionally utilised by the author . this set has form = , = , . . . , n = . we split such a table into sections with respect to , where the i-th section corresponds to portrait of at i-th level. the rst section corresponds to an active group and the crown of wreath product g, the second section is separated with a semicolon to a base of the wreath product. the sections of the base of wreath product are divided into parts by semicolon and these parts correspond to groups cij which form the base of wreath product. the l-th section of of a tableau presentation of automorphism corresponds to portrait of automorphism on level xl. the portrait of automorphisms on level xl is characterised by the sequence , where coordinate l is the vertex number of unique non trivial v.p on xl, the sequence has ii . . . il coordinates. therefore, our rst generator has the form = , which is the rooted automorphism. the second generator has the form = e; , e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; ii z }| { e, e, . . . , e | {z } i , , e, . . . , e; ii+i z }| { e, . . . , e, , e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e, . . . , e , it should be noted that after the last semicolon there are iii+ii+i trivial coordinates. there are iiii + iii + ii + i trivial coordinates before (or in other words after the fth semicolon but before ). in a section after k semicolon the coordinate of a non-trivial element k is calculated in a similar way. we know from that is generator of g, i.e. -base of g. recall that g calls k-th base of g. the subgroup g is a subgroup of all tableaux of form u with u g. let cn = nand set = we have to show that our generating set {, } generates the whole canonical generating set. for this, we obtain the second new generator in form of the tableau lcm = lcm = e; lcm , e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; e, e, . . . , e | {z } ii ; e, e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e, . . . , e . since ord = i and = , we nd that the element lcm is generator of ci since ord = ord(lcm ). we obtain that =  lcm lcm , which corresponds to generator of canonical generating set . observe that b = is generator of g, i.e. it is precisely a -base of g. it is known that the generator precisely generates the group that is isomorphic to the group for all -nd coordinate tableaux. from the same principle, one can obtain that = lcm = e; e, e, e, . . . , e | {z } i ; ii z }| { e, e, . . . , e | {z } i , lcm , e, . . . , e; ii z }| { e, . . . , e, e, e, . . . , e | {z } iii ; e . . . e . this generator generates the group which is isomorphic to the group of all -th coordinate tableaux, which is precisely i+ . making use of the same principle allows us to express all the i from our canonical generating set. note that if it were a self-similar group, then it would be more useful to present it in terms of wreath recursion, as the set where is the rooted automorphism. given a permutational representation of cij we can present our group by wreath recursion. we present by wreath recursion as = . it would be written in form lcm = lcm = (lcm, lcm, e, e, . . . , e) = , e, e, . . . , e), since ord = i and = then the element lcm is generator of ci too, because ord = ord(lcm ). we then obtain the second generator of canonical generating set by exponentiation  lcm lcm = . since we have obtained = , we can express =   , e, . . . , e  , where is a state of consider an alternative recursive constructed generating set which consists of nested automorphism states which are , ,. . . ,m and the automorphism the state is expressed as follows = . it should be noted that a second generator of a recursive generating set could be constructed in an other way, namely = i = (i, i, e, e, . . . , e) = (e, i, . . . , e, e), where is the state in a vertex of the second level x we can then express the next state of by multiplying = . therefore, by a recursive approach, we obtain = and analogously we obtain lcm = lcm = (lcm , e, . . . , e). similarly, we obtain lcmk k = lcmk k =  lcmk k , e, . . . , e  and k =  lcmk k lcm k = . the k-th generator of the recursive generating set can therefore be expressed as k k = . the last generator of our generating set has another structure, namely m = which concludes the proof. let n j= cij be generated by and and m l= ckl = , denote an order of g by |g|. theorem if = and = or = and = , then there exists generating set of elements for the wreath-cyclic group g = ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl), where ij are orders of cij. proof. the generators and are directed automorphisms, , are rooted automorphisms . the structure of tableaux are described above in theorem in case = are mutually coprime and = are mutually coprime, then we group generator and in vector that is rst generator of direct product ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl). therefore, the rst generator of g has form and the second generator has form of vector . the generator has a similar structure. in order to express the generator of the canonical set from , we change the exponent from to lcm analogously, we obtain k = lcmk which concludes the proof. generators of commutator subgroup and center of a wreath product of group with a non-faithful action let us nd upper bound of generators number for g. let a be a group and b a permutation group, i.e. a group a acting upon a set x, where the active group a can act not faithfully. consider the set of all pairs {, f : x h, a a}. we dene a product on this set as { := (aa, ff a )}, where f a = f). theorem if w = , where |x| = n, |y | = m and active group a acts on x transitively, then d d + d + d. proof. the generators of w in form of tableaux : ai = , t = , . . . , tk = , tl = , where hj, cjl sb, b = sb, ai sa, a = sa. note that, on a each coordinate of tableau, that presents a commutator of and , a, b a, hi, gj b can be product of form aaa a a and higah abg aba b, according to corollary . this products should satisfy the following condition: n y ix higah abg aba b. that is to say that the product of coordinates of wreath product base is an element of commutator b. as it was described above it is subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition . this is the case because not all element of the subdirect product are independent because the elements must be chosen in such a way that holds. we may rearrange the factors in the product in the following way: n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) b. where is a commutator in case cw = we express this element from b as commutator if cw = in the general case, we would have cw q j= instead of this element. this commutator are formed as product of commutators of rearranged elements of n q i= higah abg aba therefore, we have a subdirect product of n the copies of the group b which has been equipped by condition . the multiplier cw q j= from b, which has at least d generators n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) cw y j= b. since ( n q i= higih i g i ) = e and the product cw q j= belongs to b, then condition holds. the assertion of a theorem on a recursive principle is easily generalized on multiple wreath product of groups. thus minimal total amount consists of at least d generators for n factors of group b, d generators for the dependent factor from b and d generators of the group a which concludes the proof. it should be noted that not all the elements of commutator subgroup, that has structure of the subdirect product, are independent by , at least one of them must be chosen carefully such that would be satised. this implies the estimation d d + d. thus minimal total amount consists of at least d generators for n factors of group b, d generators for the dependent factor from b and d generators of the group a which concludes the proof. we shall consider special case when a passive group of w is a perfect group. since we obtain a direct product of n the copies of the group b then according to corollary . of wiegold j. d d + n . more exact upper bound give us theorem a. , which use s a the size of the smallest simple image of g. as it were studied by j. wiegold if among group of product q n i= are n same perfect groups then dn) < d + + logsn, where s = ord where h is minimal prime non abelian group, which is image of g . therefore, in this case our upper bound has the form d clogsn + d + d. now we consider no regular wreath product, where active group can be both as innite as nite and consider a centre of such group. this is generalization of theorem from the book because action of a is not non faithfully. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be a-space. if an non faithfully action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of b from direct product bn then we have not standard wreath product b that is semidirect product of a and q xix b that is an and the following proposition holds. let k = ker that is subgroup of a that acts on x as a pointwise stabiliser, that is kernel of action of a on x. denote the set of all the orbits of a on x by o, if this set is nite then by of. recall that the direct product indexed by innite set consists of all innite sequences, and the direct sum consists only of sequences with nitely many elements distinct from zero. denote by z( ) the subgroup of diagonal subgroup fun) of functions f : x z which are constant on each orbit of action of a on x for unrestricted wreath product, and denote by z) the subgroup of diagonal fun) of functions with the same property for restricted wreath product, where n is number of non-trivial coordinates in base of wreath product. proposition a centre of the group b is direct product of normal closure of centre of a diagonal of z i.e. )), trivial an element, and intersection of e with z. in other words, z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, z e k) z), where h z, |x| = n. for restricted wreath product with n non-trivial coordinate: z b) = , e, z e k) z) l jof k) z. in case of unrestricted wreath product we have: z b) = , e, z e k) z( ) = q jo k) z. proof. the elements of center subgroup have to satisfy the condition: f : x b such is constant on each orbit oj of action a on x i.e. f = bi for any x oj. also every bx: bx z. indeed the elements of form (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from a because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of bn does not change it. also h commutes with any element of base of b because h from centre of b. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, then its kernel k = e which conrms the proposition. also elements of subgroup e) belongs to z b) iit acts trivial on x. if we have unrestricted wreath product then we show that the center z is the subgroup of elements of form satisfying the following conditions: f is constant on each orbit of a on x, i.e. f = cj for any x oj, where oj o, and cj z. a z k. by the same reasons as for nite set of non-trivial elements on x applied to oj as above it is obvious that if an element of b satises the conditions ) and ), then the element belongs to the center z wrb). on the contrary, if the element b does not satisfy one of the conditions ) or ) then there exists a a that ag = ga or g acts non trivial on xi x therefore = , where b is on xi coordinate. in case of violation of condition ) there will be no commutation on the second coordinate. example if a = z then a centre z b) = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nze : h z). since the action dened by shift on nite set x is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. generating set for commutator subgroup , where zn, zm are presentation in additive form, is the following: h = , h = , . . . hn = . thus, it consist of n tableaux of form hi = and relations for coordinate of any tableau hi, i {, . . . , n } is hi + + hin according to theorem , for wreath product of abelian groups presented in multiplicative form, this relation has the form n y i= hifia h iab f iab a = n y i= (hifia h iab f iab a i+ y j=i+  hj, fja  ) = e. let be innite cyclic group acting on n-letters alphabet. we denote m-elements set by xm. example if g z then z nz mz z. proof. let us prove it applying proposition we note that in case of action on nite set there is not dierence between restricted and unrestricted wreath products. our formula of centre of two groups a acting on x and b wreath product will be used by us. this formula states that z b) ker) z, where ker is kernel of acting a on x (in our such action by shifts of z on xn is not faithful, the kernel of action z on xn) in subgroup nz because of in every n shifts by cyclic the shifting point of xn returns on its initial place). in a case of the new group g z we consider two groups again z w , where w = . according to our formula in we obtain the centre z = mzz therefore it remains to calculate the centre of the rst group the kernel of its action. the kernel of action i.e. z on xn is the group nz because of the action of z on n-elements set xn has the period n. applying the formula to z w we conclude that z w) = nz mz z. the quotient g/g is zzz therefore the quotient group of g/g by the centre z is the following zn zm e. thus, centre z is subgroup of nite index in g = z) z z z. example if g = zn zm is standard wreath product, then d = n let g = z x z and g = a x b be a restricted wreath product, where only n non-trivial elements in coordinates of base of wreath product which are indexed by elements from x, in degenerated case | x |= n. z acts on x by left shift. also a acts transitively from left. remark the quotient group of a restricted wreath products g = z x z by a commutator subgroup is isomorphic to zz. in previous conditions if g = ax b then, g/g = a/ab/b. if g = znzm, where = , then d = if g = zz is an unrestricted regular wreath product then g/g ze z. proof. consider the element of g = ax b, where a can be z which acts on x by left shift, then elements of commutator subgroup has form: , where hi b. according to corollary the commutator of elements h = , g = , g, h g satises the condition , which for case where b is abelian such: n q i= higah abg aba = e, where gi, hi are non trivial coordinates from base of group, a, b a, gi, hj b. the commutator with the shifted coordinate higah abg aba appears within the i-th coordinate position due to action of a. according to corollary the set of elements satisfying condition forms a commutator. also the equivalent condition can be formulated: n y i= higih i g i b, therefore, if b is abelian an element h of g belongs to g ih satisfy a condition: n q i= hi = e. for unrestricted wreath product to show that all base of wreath product is in the commutator subgroup we choose an element , where hi is variable, and form a commutator which is an arbitrary element of wreath product base: [e; . . . , h , h , h , . . .] = . for convenience we present active group in the additive form. then to previous equality holds the following equations have to be satised: h h = g, h h = , h h = , . it implies that h = h , h = h, h = h, hi + = hi. therefore hi = , i from other side we have h h = g, h h = , h h = , ., so hi = g, for all i < that is impossible in the restricted case but possible in the unrestricted. as a corollary g/g z z for restricted case. thus, for unrestricted case all base of g is in g as a corollary g/g z e. thus, this group is a subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with the additional condition where, because for any element of the subgroup of coordinates there exists a surjective homomorphism acting upon b, we can conclude that g must be a subdirect product. the commutator subgroup is the kernel of homomorphism : g g/g. more precisely, g = g/g z/z z/z = z z. in case g = a b the ker has the same structure, the homomorphism maps those elements of bn, as base of g, which satisfy n q i= hi = e, i.e. the elements of b in e of the group g/g. thus, ker = g. to show that the properties of injectivity and surjectivity hold for this homomorphism, we chose the elements from g which have the form that can be generator in canonical form of generating set of wreath product , where h / g, corresponding to a a specimen from the quotient group b/b. also we chose independently, an element of the form corresponding to a specimen of the quotient group a/a. therefore, we must have a one-to-one correspondence between g/g and a/a b/b. in this case, we obtain g/g a/a b/b . the basic property of homomorphism for generators in canonical form is obviously accomplished. in the scenario when the action of z upon the n elements from the set is isomorphic to the action of zn elements on the set or the action of the zn elements on itself. in case g = z z we have g/g . for the group g = zn zm the same is true with g/g and dependently of fact of = or not can admits one or two generators. for the group g = zn zm it should be noted that the same is true. in the general case, n i= zmi can have only one generator more than the quotient by commutator has. application to geometric groups of dieomorphisms acting on the m obius band maksymenko s. studied various dierent geometric objects and considered the actions of dieomor- phisms on them. we now consider the algebraic structure and the generators for a group of such type. let m be a smooth compact connected surface, p be either the real line or the circle, f : m p be a smooth map, and o be the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group di) of dieomorphisms of m. we assume that at each critical point, the map f is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial in two variables without multiple factors. conversely, it should be noted that every group obtained in the way described will be isomorphic to g for some smooth map f : m p. we will now specify the object and the construction of orbits under the action of the group dieomorphisms. let f : m r be a morse function on a connected compact surface m. let s and of = o be the stabiliser and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of dieomorphisms d respectively. let xf denote the partition of m whose elements are the connected components of level-sets f of f. it should be noted here that an element g xf is called critical if it contains a critical point of f, otherwise, the elements is called regular. it is well known within this research domain that the factor space m/xf, has a natural structure of a nite graph and is entitled the kronrod-reeb graph. in our case, the dieomorphisms act upon the m obius band. let m now be a compact not orientable surface and be a volume from m which has h-form of the m obius band. for a smooth map f : m r, denote by s, the subgroup d of dieomorphisms h which preserve f, i.e. those satisfying the relation f h = f. this group is associated with sid, which is a subgroup of stabiliser elements isotopic to the identity, i.e. sid, where the last isomorphism arises due to locally trivial bundle. because there are a locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid , this means that an exact sequence of homotopic groups and locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups give an explanation of the isomorphism sid . this locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups induce an exact sequence of homotopic groups of that bundle. now since the group of dieomorphisms is innitely dimensional, we have found the connected components. this group is associated with the action of the group s sid upon splitting into the function level lines f. in our case, the morse function upon m has two local extremes, which are the points of local maximum. moreover, the morse function f must have critical sets with exactly one saddle point. the lines of levels around a local maximum point of f have the form of coaxial circles, where these lines are determined by the polynomial with form + c. determined by the following homogeneous polynomial plus constant x y + c. being a little more precise, we will now consider the function of morse f on m, which satises the following three properties: f is constant on the bound m; there are two points of maximum at a saddle point; at the two points of maximum, the values of the function are equal, i.e. at every critical point of f, the germ of f is cequivalent to some homogeneous polynomial in two real variables without multiple factors. let f : m r now be a cmorse function. connected was described by maksymeko we note here that since the polynomial + c is homogeneous and has no multiple factors, it follows (from the celebrated morse lemma) that the space of all morse maps belongs to the space of maps f, where f here only has isolated critical points and p is either the real line r or the circle s let d be a group of dieomorphisms which preserve the morse function f on m. we know from the results of maksymenko s. that ) z. let there exist upon m, n identical regions xi (critical sets) which have, for example, the form of doubles, meaning that f has two critical points in each xi and additionally, that xi are the domains of simple connectedness. consider a group h of automorphisms of m which are induced by the action of dieomorphisms h of a group d which preserve the m obius function f. in other words, the h here are from the stabiliser s d. we note that the generators with stabilisers with the right action by dieomorphisms s are i. the generators of the cyclic group z which dene a shift are . since the group action is continuous, this implies that the can realize only cyclic shifts, else one would change the domains of simplicity xi order. assume there are n critical sets xi on m. the automorphism group h has exactly two subgroups z which correspond to the rotation of m, whose critical sets xi have not changed the order of xi and n denotes the subgroup of automorphisms of n critical sets. analogously to previous investigations , there exists a short exact sequence zm z , where the g-group of automorphisms are reebs graph and hence of is an orbit under action of dieomorphism group. the application of such an action results in a surjective epimorphism to a group z, which has the left inverse and arises as a result of splitting. the automorphism group therefore has the structure of a semi-direct product n z. this is in agreement with the work of maksymenko s. who considers a similar scenario but for a dierent group and set . moreover, we note that this morse function f has critical sets xi on m obius band with one saddle point. the minimal set of generators for the fundamental group of the orbit of the function f with respect to the action of the group of dieomorphisms of non-moving m is found in the next theorem. we note that since the action of the group of dieomorphisms on n-critical sets of m have been determined and described, the next thing to be considered is how this group has the correspondent to this action structure zn. we will denote by h, the fundamental group the rst generator is since it realises the shift of the m obius band. the second, , realises the rotation of domains xi of simple connectedness upon the m obius band when passing through its twisting point. in other words, acts by the automorphism by permutation of sheets of doubles xi with the winding of outer adjacency on each double xi. thus, we conclude that i has innite order. bounds on these domains are the lines of levels of function f upon these domains, or in other words, the sets of points with f = const we shall now prove that the action of the rst generator of the group denes the homomorphism in aut.. theorem the group h zn = , with dened above homomorphism in autzn has two generators and non trivial relations nn = , iijj = jjii, < i, j < n. also this group admits another presentation in generators and relations , , . . . , n i = i+ , ij = ji, i, j n . proof. from the description above, we have that the action of the rst generator of the group, , denes the homomorphism in the aut. there exists such a dieomorphism from d, called the dehn twist, which has an innite order since it makes a winding of outer adjacency on the doubles xi, and it belongs to stabiliser s. the generator must therefore correspond to this dieomorphism. let xi denote the number of domains from xi. the action of the rst generator , denes the homomorphism = , where = . it should be noted that this action could be equivalently represented as = [ +n n ]modn), . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). we extend the action of onto an arbitrary z. this action involves sequential shifts of xi along the orbit on m dened as . we have = [ +n n ]modn), . . . . . . , [ +nk n ]xmodn, . . . , [ n]xmodnxn). we will now consider two sets. the rst set is = {, , . . . , n}. as an example, if = , then we have  +n n  =  +n n  = additionally, we nd the numbers m n such that  m+n n  = and the numbers that are congruent to these m modulo n. the second set is = {, , , . . . , n+}. similarly, we note that congruence modulo n is of interest. as an example, if = , then we have  +n n  =  +n n  = hence, z, = l is the number of shifts dened by , while i corresponds to the action of automorphism by permutation with winding of outer adjacency on the doubles xi. we conclude that i therefore has an innite order due to the dehn twist. the value of the sign of the xi indicates the presence of a rotation of the doubles or its absence. the relations for the non-minimal generating set is precisely , , . . . , n i = i+ . this formulation yields that the relations for the minimal generating set is , are nn = , || = || = , = , where = and since nin = i+ we transform our minimal generating set into a canonical generating set of the n + elements given by , , , . . . , n. it is known that the generators of the semidirect product g h may be presented in the form . we now utilise this form to say that the generators of zn have the form of vectors = , = , ??, n = . making us of the operation of conjugation for = = , allows us to express the second generator of zn. note that this is by = , where h is one of generators of zn and g is generator of z. = . analogously, we nd = , and, for a general term, we nd = . word from fn due to conjugation by we can transform it to form canonocal form. we show that there are not otherwise independent relations within the group h. for this group h, all canonical words have the form k s s . . . sn n . this form follows from the form of semidirect product elements. we now prove using and reductions of reciprocals elements, that we may transform any nite non-trivial word of fn+ to the form . additionally, we shall prove that the set of all words which maps trivially by a surjective homomorphism, with a kernel which is a normal closure of relations from the set r from , are those coincides with trivial words in the group . for this purpose, we prove the transformation equivalence i = i+ in fact, i = i = . it should be noted that the relation ij = ji holds since automorphisms of xi and xj are independent of each other. therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all the to be in the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. we will show that normal closure of the relations i = i+, with ij = ji, determines the kernel of the surjective homomorphism from fn+ to h. the images of such a mapping are the canonical words which have the form of h. the form of these canonical words are determined by the semidirect product zn and its automorphisms. this mapping has the form xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm k s s . . . sn n , where xji fn+, xp j xp j xp j . . . xpm jm fn+ and n p i= si + k = m p l= pl. for this purpose, we use the transformation equivalence i = i+ making use this transformation allows us to therefore rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , . . . , n}. being a little more precise, this conversion is expressed as i = i = . the kernel of surjective homomorphism contains exactly those words that, after mapping, becomes the trivial words in the group h since those trivial words have the form . . . n. note that an arbitrary word from ker may be transformed due to into i i . . . in n , where ik = for all k. in fact, ker is the normal closure of the relations and hence it consist of the words i i+, with . in particular, the word i i+ transforms by to i+ i+ the words from the normal closure must therefore have zero sum of powers for each generator. in the real group h, with the reduced canonical words , where all generators have innite order, only those words with zero exponents of generators are trivial. we have therefore found all such relations. which concludes the proof. it should be noted that the main property of the homomorphism , from fn+ onto h, holds due to the same transformation . we now consider = =  xp j xp j . . . xpm jm   xq i xq i . . . xqm im  = k s s . . . sn n m j j . . . jn n = k+m f f . . . fn n thus, the main property of the homomorphism holds. it should be noted that such a relation nn = is typical for a wreath product. the homomorphism from the group z into the group autzn, determining a shift of generators of zn, can be equivalently presented by the matrix . for the case n = , has the form = . the generators of the subgroup zn can be presented in the form of vectors. these vectors are precisely , , . . . , . in order to check the relation for the case n = , we consider = . thus, = e and our relation nn = holds. it should be noted that the research of maksymenko s. tells us that a group of this kind arises as a fundamental group of the orbit for some morse function f which, as described above, acts upon the m obius band m. note that we have derived the relation nn = . if we now multiply this from left on , we can equivalently express this as nn = e. in a similar fashion, the multiplication from the right on n obtains n = n. one such relation characterises the bauslag-soliter group. this is the group g, which has the form g = a, b; abma = bk , where m, k z. note the bauslag-soliter group has only one relation. z which is elements multiple of n because we make a reduction by mod n. corollary a centre of the group h = zn is a normal closure of sets: diagonal of zn, trivial an element and kernel of action by conjugation that is generated by n . in other words, z = (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, nz e, where h, g z. thus, z nzz. since the action is dened by conjugation and relation nin = i holds then the element n commutates with every i. so subgroup stabilise all xi of z-space m. other words subgroup nbelongs to kernel of action . besides the element (; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from h because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of zn does not change it. we generalize the result of meldrum j. because we consider not only the permutation wreath product groups, but the group a does not have to act upon the set x faithfully, hence b is not regular wreath product. recall that an action is said to be faithful if for every g g, there exists x from g-space x such that xg = x. we consider wreath products with no regular actions of the active group z. let x = {x, x, . . . , xn} be the z-space. if an action by conjugation determines a shift of the copies of z from the direct product zn then, we have not found a standard wreath product z which is a semidirect product of z and q xix z, i.e. zn. thus, we observe the following corollary holds. corollary the centre of the group zn z consists of normal closure of the diagonal of zn, a trivial element and the kernel of action by conjugation, i.e. nz. in other words, z = ; h, h, . . . , h | {z } n ), e, enz z, where h, g z, z nz z. proof. the proof follows immediately from corollary by utilising the kernel of action of . the stabiliser of such an action over the z-space x = {x, x, . . . , xn} is the subgroup nz. additionally, the kernel of this action has elements from the diagonal of zn. it should be noted, if we have g = z xm z xn z, where |xm| = m and |xn| = n, then the action is dened by the shift upon nite set xn. in this case, we nd that |x| = n is not faithful and its kernel is also isomorphic to nz since the cyclic shift on the n coordinates is invariant on x. note that the action is dened by the shift on the nite set xm is not faithful and its kernel is isomorphic to mz. additionally, within this kernel of action is the elements from the diagonal of znm which are isomorphic to z. thus, its centre is z nz mz z which concludes the proof. remark the centre of a group of the form zn b generates, by normal closure of: centre of diagonal of bn, trivial an element, and nz x e.","The section discusses the commutator width of groups,

"as it was investigated before by a. lucchini a case of generating set of cn p g when g is a nite n-generated group and p is a prime not dividing the order |g| and cp be the cyclic group of order p was investigated by a. lucchini. according to results by a. lucchini the wreath product cn p g is also n-generated. we consider in role of active group g the cyclic group, also we generalize this wreath product on iterated wreath product of such groups and direct product of wreath products of cyclic groups. the similar question for iterated wreath product was studied by bondarenko e. v. in a series of maksymenko s. i. papers were proved that the n-th homotopy groups of the orbit o of f with respect to the right action of the group di of dieo- morphisms of m, coincides with the ones of m for n , o = , while for the fundamental group o it was shown that it contains a free abelian subgroup of - nite index. however the information about o remains incomplete. we found the minimal generating set and relations for one of such o .",The text discusses the investigation of generating sets in the context of finite n-generated groups and prime numbers.

of wreath product. the sections of the base of wreath product are divided into parts by semicolon too and these parts correspond to groups cij which form the base of wreath product. the l-th section of of a tableau presentation of automorphism corresponds to portrait of automorphism on level xl. the portrait of automorphisms on level xl is characterized by the sequence , where coordinate of l is

wreath recursion, as the set where is the rooted automorphism. given a permutational representation of cij we can present our group by wreath recursion. we present by wreath recursion as = . it would be written in form lcm = lcm = = , e, e, , e), since ord = i and = then the element lcm is generator of ci too, because ord = ord(lcm ). then we obtain the second generator of canonical generating set by exponentation  lcm lcm = . since we have obtain = , then we can express =   , e, , e  , where is a state of consider an alternative recursive constructed generating set consisting of nested au- tomorphism states that are , ,,m and the automorphism the state is expressed as follows = . a second generator of a recursive generating set also could be constructed in an other way = i = = . where is the state in a vertex of the second level x then we express the next state of by multiplying = . therefore by a recursive approach we obtain = and analogously we get lcm = lcm =  lcm , e, , e  . entirely similar we get lcmk k = lcmk k =  lcmk k , e, , e  and k =  lcmk k lcm k = . thus, the k-th generator of recursive generating set could be expressed as follows k k = . the last generator of our generating set has another structure m = . let n j= cij be generated by and and m l= ckl = , denote by |g| an order of g. theorem if = and = or = and = , then there exists generating set of elements for wreathcyclic group g = ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl), where ij are orders of cij. the generators and are directed automorphisms, , are rooted auto- morphisms . the structure of tableaux are described above in theorem in case = are mutually coprime and = are mutually coprime, then we group generator and in vector that is rst generator of direct product ( n j= cij) ( m l= ckl). therefore rst generator of g has form and the second generator has form of vector . the generator has a similar structure. to express the generator of canonical set from , we exponent to lcm analogously k = lcmk. generators of commutator and commutator width of wreath product let us nd upper bound of generators number for g. more generally, let a be a group and b a permutation group, i.e. a group a acting on a set x (active group a can acts not faithfully). consider the set all pairs {, f : x h, a a}. a product on this set is dened by { := (aa, ff a )}, where f a = f). theorem if w = , where |x| = n, |y | = m and is active group acting on x, then d d + d + d. proof. generating set of generators in form of tableaux for w : ai = , t = , , tk = , tl = , where hj, cjl sb, b = sb, ai sa, a = sa. let orbits of an action a on x are {oj}jj. note that, on a each coordinate of tableau, that presents a commutator of and , a a, b b it can be product of form aaa a a and higah abg aba b, this should satisfy the following condition: n y ioj higah abg aba b, j j. viz the product of coordinate of wreath product base is an element of commutator b. as it was described above it is subdirect product of b b b | {z } n with additional condition . it is just the case because not all element of this subdirect product are independent, since even one element have to be chosen in such way in order that holds. if we rearrange all factors in product in the following way: n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) b. where is a commutator in case cw = we express this element from b as commutator if cw = in general case instead of this element we have cw q j= . this commutator are formed as product of commutators of rearranged elements of n q i= higah abg aba we can generate it by generators of form that is in our generating set. therefore, we have a direct product of n the copies of the group b and the multiplier cw q j= from b, which has at least d generators n y i= higah abg aba = ( n y i= higih i g i ) cw y j= b. since ( n q i= higih i g i ) = e and the product cw q j= belongs to b, then condition holds. the assertion of a theorem on a recursive principle is easily generalized on multiple wreath product of groups. then we have direct product of n factors of group b and one factor b, which has at least d generators, where d is the minimal number of generators of the group g. we shall consider special case when a passive group of w is a perfect group. since we obtain a direct product of n the copies of the group b then according to corollary . of j. wiegold d d + n . more exact upper bound give us theorem a., which use s a the size of the smallest simple image of g. according to the theorem a. for all suciently large n the following estimation d clogsn holds, where c is a constant. therefore, in this case our upper bound has form: d clogs + d + d. now we consider no regular wreath product, where active group can be both as innite as nite and consider a center of such group. let x = {x, x, , xn} be a-space. if an non faithfully action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of a from direct product bn then we have not standard wreath product b that is semidirect product of a and q xix b that is an and the following proposition holds. let k = ker that is subgroup of a that acts on x as a pointwise stabilizer, that is kernel of action of a on x. proposition a center of the group b is normal closure of diagonal of z i.e. )), trivial an element, and z) e. other words z b) = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, z ez z, where h z and k = ker. indeed the elements of form (; h, h, , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjuga- tion of any element from a because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of bn does not change it. also h commutate with any element of base of b because h from center of b. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, then its kernel k = e. example. if a = z then a center z b) = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, nze : h z. since the action is dened by shift on nite set x, |x| = n is not faithfully, and its kernel is isomorphic to nz because cyclic shift on n coordinates is invariant on x. generating set for commutator subgroup , where zn, zm have presentation in additive form, is the following: h = , h = , , , hn = . thus, it consist of n tableaux of form hi = and relations for coordinate of any tableau hi, i {, , n } is hi + + hin according to theorem for wreath product of abelian groups which presented in multi- plicative form this relation has form n y i= hifiah iabf iab a = n y i= (hifiah iabf iab a i+ y j=i+  hj, fja  ) = e. example. let g = zn zm is standard wreath product, then d = n application to geometric groups of dieomorphisms act- ing on the mebius band the following geometric objects and actions of dieomorphisms were considered by maksymenko s. we are going to investigate an algebraic structure and generators of one group of such type. let m be a smooth compact connected surface, p be either the real line or the circle, f : m p be a smooth map, and o be the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group di ) of dieomorphisms of m. assume that at each of its critical point the map f is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial in two variables without multiple factors. conversely, every group obtained in the way describe above is isomorphic to g for some smooth map f : m p. now we specify the object and the construction of orbits under the action the group of dieomorphisms. let f : m r be a morse function on a connected compact surface m, and s and o be respectively the stabilizer and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of dieomorphisms d. let xf the partition of m whose elements are connected components of level-sets f of f. an element g xf is called critical if it contains a critical point of f, otherwise, g is regular. it is well known that the factor space m/xf has a natural structure of a nite graph, called kronrod-reeb graph. in our case, the dieomorphisms act on the mebius band. let m be a compact not orientable surface and be a volume from m that h form of mebius band. for a smooth map f : m r denote by s the subgroup d of dieomorphisms h of m preserving f, i.e. satisfying the relation f h = f. this group is associated with sid a subgroup of stabilizer elements isotopic to the identity, namely sid, last isomorphism arises due to locally trivial bun- dle. since there is locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid then an exact sequence of homotopic groups and locally trivial bundle of homotopical groups give an explanation of isomorphism sid . this lo- cally trivial bundle of homotopical groups with base and layer sid induce an exact sequence of homotopic groups of bundle. since the group of dieomorphisms is innitely dimensional, we have the connected components. this group is associated with the action of group s/sid on splitting into function level lines f. in our case the morse function on m has two local extreme which are points of local maximum. moreover, the morse function f has critical sets with one saddle point. lines of levels around a local maximum point of f has form of coaxial circles these lines are determined by polynomial of form + c. lines of levels of f around a sadle point of f has form of hyperbolic curve and these lines are determined by the following homogeneous polynomial plus constant x y + c. more precisely, we consider the function of morse f on m that has the following properties: f is constant on the bound m, it has points of maximum at a saddle point, at these points of maximum, the values of the function are equal. let f : m r be a cmorse function. let d be a group of dieomorphisms preserving morse function f on m , then ) z. let on m are n identical regions xi , having for example the form of doubles, where f has critical points in each xi also xi are domains of simple connectedness. consider a group h of automorphisms of m which are induced by the action of dieomorphisms h of a group d such that preserving the mebius function f, that is, such h are from the stabilizer s d. generators of their stabilizers by right action by dieomorphisms s are i. generators of cyclic group z, dening a shift, is . since the group action is continuously then can realize only cyclic shift, without changing the domains of simplicity xi order. let there are n critical sets xi on m. the automorphism group h has too subgroups z which corresponds to rotation of m with all critical sets xi without changing order of xi and n is the subgroup of automorphisms of n critical sets. analogously to investigations of there is short exact sequence zm z , where g-group of automorphisms reebs graph and of is orbit under action of dieomorphism group, as a result of such an action, a surjective epimorphism to a group z, which has left inverse and arises as well as splitting. therefore, the automorphism group has the structure of a semi-direct product n z as it also was shown by maksymenko s. in the similar case for another group and set . moreover, this morse function f has critical sets xi on mebius band with one saddle point. the minimal set of generators for the fundamental group of the orbit of the function f with respect to the action of the group of dieomorphisms of non-moving on m is found in the next theorem. since the action of the group of dieomorphisms on n-critical sets of m are determined and described above, then the considered by us group has the correspondent to this action structure zn. denote by h the fundamental group the rst generator is it realizes shift of mebius band and second realize rotation of domains xi of simple connectedness on mebius band when passing through the twisting point of mebius band . other wodrs acting by automorphism by permutation of sheets of doubles xi with winding of outer adjacency on each doubles xi. thus, i has innite order. bounds of these domains are line of level of function f on these domains, viz the such sets of points, where f = const we shall prove that relation is true. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in aut. let us prove that relation is true. theorem the group h zn = , with dened above homomorphism in autzn has two generators and non trivial relations nn = , iijj = jjii, < i, j < n. also this group admits another presentation in generators and relations , , , n i = i+ , ij = ji, i, j n . according to described above action we have that the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism in the autzn. there exists such difeomsrphism from d, that calls dehn twist, which has innite order becase it makes winding of outer adjacency on this doubles xi, and it belongs to stabilizer s. thus generator corresponds to this difeomsrphism. let xi denote the number of domain xi. the action of the rst generator of the group, denes the homomorphism = , where = . also the action could be represented as = [ +n n ]modn), , [ +nk n ]xmodn, , [ n]xmodnxn). we extend the action of onto arbitrary z. this action is sequential shifts of xi along orbit on m dened by . = [ +n n ]modn), , [ +nk n ]xmodn, , [ n]xmodnxn). consider two sets. first set are = , , , n, for instance = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = , also the numbers m n such that  m+n n  = and the numbers that are congruent to these m by modulo n. second set are = , , , , n + also the numbers that are congruent to these by modulo n, for instance if = , then  +n n  =  +n n  = hence, z, = l is a number of shifts dened by , i corresponds to action of automorphism by permutation with winding of outer adjacency on this doubles xi. thus, i has innite order due to dehn twist. a value of sign of the xi means the presence of a rotation of doubles or its absence. relations in non minimal generating set is the following , , , n i = i+ . it yields that the relations in the minimal generating set , are following: nn = , || = || = , = . where = and due to relation nin = i+ we transform our minimal generating set in canonical generat- ing set of n + element , , , , n. as well known the generators of semidirect product g h can be presented in form , we make use this form. the generators of zn has form of vector = , = , . . . , n = . using operation of conju- gation of = = by = , where h is one of generators of zn and g is generator of z, we express the second generator of zn. = . analogously = , = . we shall to show that there are not else independent relations in h. in the group h all canonical words has form k s s sn n . this form follows from form of a semidirect product elements. we prove that using relation from and reductions of reciprocals elements we transform any nite non trivial word of fn+ to form . also we shall prove that set of all words which maps in trivial by surjective homomorphism with a kernel that is normal closure of relations set r from are coincides with trivial words in the group . for this goal we shall to prove transformation equivalence i = i+ in fact, i = i = . also the relation ij = ji holds because automorphisms of xi an xj are indepen- dent of each other. therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , , n}. we shall to show that normal closure of relations i = i+, ij = ji determines the kernel of surjective homomorphism from fn+ to the group h. the images of such mapping are canonical words which are form h. the form of canonical words are deter- mined by the semidirect product zn and its automorphisms. this mapping has form xp j xp j xp j xpm jm k s s sn n , where xji fn+, xp j xp j xp j xpm jm fn+, n p i= si + k = m p l= pl. for this goal we use transformation equivalence i = i+ therefore, using this transformation, we can rearrange all to the rst position in the word over the alphabet {, , , n}. more precisely, this conversion is written as imodn = imodn = modn. the kernel of surjective homomorphism contains exactly that words that after mapping becomes in trivial words in group h because trivial words in h has form n. an arbitrary word from ker can be transformed due to in i i in n , where ik = for all k. in fact ker is nor- mal closure of relations , then it consist of words i i+, . the word i i+ transforms due to to i+ i+ thus, the words from normal closure has zero sum of powers of each generator. in real group h with reduced canonical words k s s sn n , where all generators have in- nite order only words with zero exponents of generators are trivial. therefore we found all relations. the main property of homomorphism from fn+ onto h holds due to this trans- formation too. consider = = (xp j xp j xpm jm ) (xq i xq i xqm im ) = k s s sn n m j j jn n = k+m f f fn n . thus, main property of homomorphism holds. such relation nn = is typical for wreath product. since there homomrphism from the group z into the group autzn which determines a shift of generators of zn can be presented by the matrix , which for case n = has form = , and generators of subgroup zn can be presented in form of vectors , , , . to check the relation for n = we consider = . thus, = e and our relation nn = holds. the group of such kind arises as fundamental group of orbit for some morse function f, which described above, on mebius band m . so we derived the relation nn = if we multiply it from left on then we express nn = e. also we multiply it from the right on n thus we obtain the result n = n. such a relation characterizes bauslag-soliter group, that is, the group g having the form g = a, b; abma = bk , where m, k z. but bauslag-soliter group has only one relation. according to the criterion of almost fp- approximability of groups for n = m, the group g is almost fp-approximable for any prime number p. corollary a center of the group h = zn is a normal closure of sets: diagonal of zn, trivial an element and kernel of action by conjugation that is generated by n . other words z = (; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, nz e, where h, g z. thus, z nz z. since the action is dened by conjugation and relation nin = i holds then the element n commutates with every i. so subgroup stabilize all xi of z-space m. other words subgroup nbelongs to kernel of action . besides the element (; h, h, , h | {z } n ) will not be changed by action of conjugation of any element from h because any permutation elements coordinate of diagonal of zn does not change it. we generalize result of meldrum because, we consider not only permutation wreath product groups, and a group a can acts on a set x not faithfully b). recall that action is faithful if for every g g exists x from g-space x such that xg = x. we consider wreath product with no regular action of active group z. let x = {x, x, , xn} be z-space. if an action by conjugation determines a shift of copies of z from direct product zn then we have not standard wreath product z that is semidirect product of z and q xix z that is zn and the following corollary holds. corollary a center of the group zn z consists of normal closure of diagonal of zn, trivial an element, and kernel of action by conjugation that is nz. other words z = ; h, h, , h | {z } n ), e, e, where h, g z, z nz z. the prove is immediately follows from corollary and kernel of action of . then stabilizer of action on z-space x = {x, x, , xn} is subgroup nz. also in kernel of action is elements from diagonal of zn. remark. a center of a group of form zn b generates by normal closure of: diagonal of bn, trivial an element, and nz x e.","The work strengthens previous results by introducing a new class of wreathcyclic groups constructed using a specific formula. A semidirect product may arise with a given homomorphism, leading to a group that is isomorphic to a fundamental orbital group of a morse function. The group structure is described using automorphisms and recursive generating sets. The group is further analyzed in the context of geometric groups and actions of automorphisms on a mebius band. The structure and generators of the group are explored in detail, along with the identification of fundamental group properties. The presentation includes detailed proofs and generalizations of the groups discussed."

"w ith increasing demand for video services , , the need for more efcient video coding is also growing. in response to such demand, joint video experts team was established after the latest video coding standard, high efciency video coding , and has been exploring future video coding technologies. in , jvet called for proposals for the next video coding standard, tentatively named versatile video coding . some of the submitted propos- als considerably surpass the performance of hevc in terms of both subjective and objective qualities . interestingly, several contributions proposed deep neural network - aided coding tools. recently, dnn-based coding tools have become a topic of interest, and experimental results superior to the conventional coding tools in terms of rate-distortion performance have started to appear in the literature. some of these have also been discussed in jvet meetings as part of normative tools . for example, dnn-based quality improvement for in-loop lter- ing and post-ltering have been actively researched in both academia and the standardization community . other aspects of video coding where dnns have been suggested are intra and inter prediction , reduction of coding complexity , modeling the rd relationship , and replacing the entire coding pipeline by a dnn . given h. choi and i. v. baji c are with the school of engineering science, simon fraser university, bc, va s, canada. e-mail: chyomin@sfu.ca, ibajic@ensc.sfu.ca. this work was supported in part by the vanier scholarship and the nserc grant rgpin-- the variety of coding tools where dnns have already made inroads, they appear to be an inevitable technological trend in video compression. for intra prediction, , employed a convolutional neural network with neighbouring blocks (instead of reference lines) as inputs, to generate a predicted block. more- over, included a recurrent neural network into their predictor for improved accuracy. a fully connected net- work architecture is adopted in , for intra prediction, and the input samples are also from the neighboring region. specically, proposed a discrete cosine transform -domain predictor, where the output of the mlp is subject to inverse dct to obtain the predicted pixels. however, most of the coding gain in video compression comes from inter prediction. recent works on inter prediction using dnns include interpolation lters , , enhanced motion compensation , and texture prediction, which directly generates the predicted pixel values using reference samples/frames as inputs to the trained network without transferring motion information. in this paper, we propose a dnn-based frame prediction architecture that is able to support both uni- and bi-directional prediction. our work is inspired by recent progress on frame prediction , and is the rst, to our knowledge, to develop a single dnn that can support both p and b frame coding. the paper is organized as follows. section ii reviews recent related work on dnn-based inter prediction, and identies the contributions of this paper. in section iii, presents the archi- tecture of the proposed dnn and describes how the proposed dnn-based prediction can be used in video coding. section iv describes the training strategy and presents an ablation study for the proposed dnn. section v presents the experimental results of prediction performance and compression efciency of the proposed dnn in various congurations. finally, the paper is concluded in section vi.","The increasing demand for video services has led to a need for more efficient video coding.

"a. prior work inter coding plays a crucial role in achieving high efciency in video compression. fractional-pel motion compensation requires a frame to be interpolated in between existing pixels to compensate for continuous motion of objects. in hevc, dct-based interpolation lters provide quarter-pel precision, but their coefcients are non-adaptive, which may limit their effectiveness . in , , cnns have been used for content-adaptive interpolation. specically, zhang et al. proposed a half-pel interpolation lter based on a super- resolution network , while yan et al. proposed a different cnn-based interpolation lter. arxiv:v jun fig. the proposed deep frame prediction in the encoder and decoder . other studies that have looked at the use of neural networks in motion compensation include . huo et al. proposed a cnn-based motion compensation renement al- gorithm. the suggested network has the motion-compensated block and its neighboring coded area as inputs, and it generates the rened prediction block. considering the spatial correlation between adjacent pixels, especially for small blocks, this approach is able to reduce some artifacts along the block boundaries. the approach is less suitable for larger blocks, but it is applicable to both uni- and bi-prediction. in , , zhao et al. suggested cnn-based bi-directional motion compensation. conventional bi-prediction averages two pre- dictions unless additional weights are transmitted, while the proposed cnn combines two predictions adaptively, based on the content, and produces more accurate predicted blocks. nonetheless, this method is only applicable to bi-directional prediction. prior work that is most relevant to the present study is , where zhao et al. proposed dnn-aided bi-directional predic- tion in hevc-based video coding, and reported considerable coding gains for high quantization parameter values in the random access conguration. however, this work merely adopted the frame rate up conversion network for the purpose of video compression, even using the weights obtained in . due to these reasons, the approach in is limited by the fruc constraints imposed in , as follows: it does not properly synthesize the intermediate target frame unless the reference frames are symmetrically spaced around the target frame, and it cannot predict a future frame using previous frames, for low-delay coding scenarios. b. our contribution in this paper, we propose solutions to the issues listed above. specically, the contributions of the present work are as follows: we develop a dnn that can perform both uni- and bi- directional prediction. the proposed dnn is able to handle frames at various distances from the target frame. the proposed dnn is able to operate in all inter coding scenarios and provides a unied frame prediction tool for video coding. we describe the integration of the proposed dnn into hm reference encoder and decoder. we present an ablation study identifying the contribution of individual components of the proposed dnn. we analyze the video bitstream generated by using the proposed frame prediction in video coding and identify where the savings are being made compared with con- ventional hevc.","The text discusses the importance of inter prediction in video compression and explores the use of neural networks, specifically CNNs, to improve motion compensation in video coding. Prior works have focused on CNN-based interpolation filters and motion compensation refinement algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce artifacts. A key prior work proposed a DNN-aided bi-directional prediction approach in HEVC-based video coding, reporting significant coding gains for high quantization parameter values.

"the proposed method is an additional tool for video com- pression that supplements traditional intra/inter prediction, as shown in fig. the proposed cnn requires two frames from the decoded picture buffer , along with their temporal indices, as inputs. the network produces lter coefcients that are used to synthesize patches of a new frame, which we refer to as deep frame. once the deep frame is synthesized, it is used directly as a predictor for the current frame. therefore, with this form of inter-prediction, no additional motion information needs to be coded, only the prediction residual and block- based ags indicating the use of the proposed method. as shown in fig. , the same procedure is performed at the decoder to synthesize the deep frame, and then the residual is added to produce the nal decoded frame. a. proposed network architecture our dnn architecture for deep frame prediction is shown in fig. it is inspired by the work of niklaus et al. , who proposed a similar network for fruc. their network creates a new frame by interpolating mid-way between two consecutive frames. however, in addition to bi-directional interpolation, our proposed dnn also supports uni- directional prediction , and is able to handle reference frames at varying distances from the predicted frame. in video coding, it is important to be able to support both uni- and bi-directional prediction because, depending on the settings for different coding scenarios, some frames might not be available for prediction. this is true in low-delay cases, and more generally, in cases where the coding order does not produce an available decoded frame on both sides of the currently coded frame. the proposed network has two input paths, which are then merged inside the network. the two inputs are fed with two fig. architecture of the proposed neural network. four-channel tensors derived from two reference patches and their temporal indices are applied at the two inputs. processing is performed in ten blocks whose structure is indicated in the gure and whose input/output dimensions are shown in table i. the outputs produce spatially-varying lters that are used to synthesize the predicted patch. table i input/output dimensions of various blocks in the proposed network b b b b b b b b b b input n m n m n m n m n m n m n m n m n m n m output n m n m n m n m n m n m n m n m n m n m c patch tensors (e pt and e pt) of size n m (three color channels), from which prediction of an n m patch in the current frame is made. for training the network we used n = m = , but in testing, different values are used depending on the resolution of the coded sequence. since the proposed dnn does not contain any fully-connected layers, the output scales with input size. indices t and t (with t < t) represent time index relative to the current frame index t. the tilde character indicates that these patches come from previously decoded frames. if needed, the patches are converted from yuv to yuv to make the resolution of all color channels the same, so that conventional convolutional layers can process the input. the nal frame is converted back to yuv in addition to the color channels, the input tensor contains an additional temporal index channel. as will be seen in the ablation study in section iv-a, this channel makes a signicant contribution to the performance of the proposed network. specically, to the tensor e pti, i {, }, we append tti = ci nm, where nm is a n m matrix of all ones, and constants ci are chosen as = ( , if t < t < t, , if t < t < t. the sign of ci indicates whether the corresponding patch comes from a previous or subsequent frame, and its magnitude indicates the relative distance to the current frame. we also experimented with making ci a multiple of the scaled frame distance, but found that the best results are achieved when the reference frames are closest to the frame being predicted, and those cases can be handled by the values in . using indices as tensor channels is inspired by the work in where the authors have used spatial coordinates as additional tensor channels to achieve spatially-variant processing. here, we use this concept for temporal indices of reference frames to enable temporally-variant processing that depends on the relative positions of the reference frames and the frame to be synthesized. processing within the network is accomplished via various processing blocks , which are indicated in fig. in the gure legend, the following abbreviations are used: conv stands for the convolutional layer (with lters), relu stands for rectied linear unit activation, and bilinear stands for bilinear upsampling. input/output dimensions of various processing blocks are indicated in table i. as the typical design choice, the number of output channels for the inner blocks is a power of , and each spatial dimension changes between consecutive blocks in a multiple of or a multiple of /, depending on whether downsampling or upsampling is performed. the number of output channels for the last block b is c, which determines the size of the -d prediction kernels, as explained later in this section. we used c = in the experiments. to avoid data ination at the nal stage, the number of input channels to b should be more than c, so we chose , which is the smallest power of larger than c = working backwards from there, we determined the number of channels for each block, as shown in table i. the two inputs are initially processed separately by the adaptation block b, whose purpose is to fuse the spatial information and temporal information . its impact will be assessed in the ablation study in section iv-a. subsequently, the data from the two input paths is merged and fed to the inner portion of our dnn, which resembles a u-net . we used a depth- u-net with skip connections. the depth was chosen so that the data volume at the bottleneck is smaller, but still similar, to the input data volume. recall, the input to the dnn are two color frames of size m n, each with its own temporal index channel, for a total data volume of m n. with the selected depth- u-net, the data volume at the bottleneck is m n = m n. another modication to the original u-net is the addition of skip connections from the merge point b to each of the output blocks b the impact of this modication will be assessed through an ablation study in section iv-a. the network produces four output tensors: fd ti rnmc, where i {, }, d {h, v}. each of these tensors contains -d lter coefcients for spatially-varying convolution, and c is the lter length. for example, fh ti contains horizontal lters and fv ti contains vertical lters for processing e pti, i {, }. to apply spatially- varying convolution to pixel in e pti, we extract (channel- wise) vectors from the corresponding locations in fh ti and fv ti: f h ti = fh ti, f v ti = fv ti, and then perform the outer product to create a c c -d lter kernel k ti = f v ti(f h ti)t . finally, pixel value at location in color channel c {, , } in the predicted patch b pt is obtained as b pt = x k t e p t + x k t e p t , where represents the hadamard product (element-wise mul- tiplication) of the -d kernel and a c c region of the corresponding input patch centered at in color channel c. the sum represents summation of all elements in the hadamard product. note that the operation of performing the hadamard product and summing up the result is called local convolution and is denoted by symbol in . we use the same symbol in fig. from - it is easy to see that local convolution is in fact spatially-varying convolution, because the kernels k ti depend on . when performing the hadamard product in , samples are taken from the neighborhood of the patch in the corresponding frame, if needed. near the frame boundary, nearest-neighbor padding is used to ll up the c c matrix e p ti . from the video compression point of view, the entire operation is similar to motion compensation from a collocated reference area of size c c in the reference frames. there is no explicit motion model, but adaptive kernels, which are content-dependent, allow pixel values to be moved around to account for motion. under these conditions, one can think of c/as being the maximum horizontal/vertical motion component in the system. importantly, the entire operation - is differentiable, which allows the network to be trained via gradient descent. b. loss function the network is trained to predict the original patch pt. to accomplish this, a loss function with several terms is minimized. the rst term is the mean squared error between the predicted patch b pt and the original patch pt: ln = n m || b pt pt || f the second loss term is based on the feature reconstruction loss introduced in . according to , this term helps the model improve its prediction of details along the edges, which is important for perceptual quality of the predicted patch. this loss term is dened as lf = || (b pt) || where is a feature extraction function. we use the output of the relu_ layer of the vgg- network as our feature extraction function. the vgg- features used in lf provide good global features: they are extracted from deep within that network, at the end of the fourth convolutional block . however, those features do not capture the local structure of the input signal. for this purpose, we employ another loss term that captures more localized information. it is based on geometric features, specically the horizontal and vertical gradients computed as the differences of neighboring pixels. the mean absolute difference of the gradients in the predicted and the original patch form the corresponding loss terms: lgx = n m x x b pt xpt lgy = n m x y b pt y pt and the summations are carried out over all three color channels. the impact of these loss terms will be examined in the ablation study in section iv-a. finally, the overall loss is the weighted combination of the loss terms introduced above: l = n ln + f lf + g  lgx + lgy  , where we empirically selected n = f = and g = for training. further details of training will be discussed in section v. c. conventional vs. proposed inter prediction the proposed dnn is an alternative to conventional inter prediction in that it also uses previously coded frames to predict the currently coded frame. therefore, the proposed approach will compete with conventional prediction in the inter-coded frames in terms of rate distortion cost. to contrast the two approaches, we rst recall the components of the rd cost of conventional inter prediction. suppose a block uni-directional bi-directional fig. uni- and bi-directional prediction in the proposed method. bt in the current frame t is to be inter-coded. depending on whether uni- or bi-directional prediction is used, the motion- compensated prediction has the form = bt, uni- bt+ bt, bi- where bti is the motion-compensated pre- diction from frame ti, is the corresponding motion vector , and is a weighting parameter, which is set to by default, unless high-level syntax species another value . t is the list of time indices of reference frames, which contains only t for uni-directional prediction, otherwise both t and t, and is the list of corresponding mvs, containing one or two mvs, depending on whether prediction is uni- or bi-directional. note that in bi-directional prediction, the two reference frames are on the opposite sides of the current frame, i.e., t < t < t the distortion associated with inter prediction is convention- ally taken as the sum of absolute differences between the current block and its prediction: dinter = x |bt | where the summation is over all pixels in the block. finally, the rd cost of conventional inter prediction is given by jinter = dinter + r where r denotes a rate function that measures the number of bits required to encode residuals and other necessary param- eters, such as mvs, and is the lagrange multiplier chosen according to the quantization parameter . rd optimization nds the parameters that lead to the minimum rd cost. on the other hand, the proposed inter prediction operates as shown in fig. for uni-directional prediction, co-located patches from two preceding frames are taken, and for bi- directional prediction, co-located patches from opposite sides of the current frame are used. since the patches are co-located, no motion vectors need to be transmitted. motion information, as well as any possible weighting of contributions from the two reference frames, is effectively encoded in the spatially- varying kernels k ti , which are derived by the dnn from the reference frames, at both encoder and decoder. apart from the residual, only the ag indicating that the proposed inter fig. decoding ow with syntax at the coding block level. prediction is coded. the temporal indices of the reference frames t = do not need to be transmitted because they can be inferred as follows. in looking for reference frames from dpb, priority is given to bi-directional prediction because, in preliminary testing, we found that bi-directional prediction usually gives better results than uni- directional prediction. hence, previously coded frames closest to the current frame on both sides are selected as references if they are available. if bi-directional prediction is not possible due to unavailability of future coded frames up to distance , the two closest previously coded frames preceding the current frame are selected as references. the distortion associated with the proposed inter prediction is denoted ddnn and computed as: ddnn = x pt b pt where b pt is computed as in and the sum is over all pixels in the patch. compared with conventional inter prediction , the proposed method always exploits two reference patches even for the uni-prediction. the rd cost for the proposed method is denoted jdnn and is computed as jdnn = ddnn + r where the rate function measures the number of bits needed to encode the residual and the ag indicating that the proposed method is used. finally, rd opimization selects the smallest rd cost j among the intra, inter, and the proposed dnn-based predic- tion, as the best coding mode for the current block: j= min. in rd optimization, we do not add any bias term to encourage the proposed method to be selected. instead, we design the syntax carefully so that the proposed method can straight- forwardly compete with other prediction methods in terms of the rd cost based on the distortion and the actual bits to be coded. fig. shows the simplied decoding ow with syntax at the coding block level, where the dfp ag stands for deep frame prediction . considering that reference frames for the proposed method might not be available in certain cases in the hierarchical-b structure , the dfp ag is parsed only if these references are available. in addition, in order to minimize overhead bits for the proposed method, parsing the dfp ag is done after parsing intra/inter mode. therefore, the dfp ag is not used in intra blocks. this is also the case for the inter block where the references for the proposed method are unavailable. when the dfp ag is set, only the residual bits are parsed. note that the blocks coded by the proposed method do not have any mvs associated with them. while this saves bits compared to conventional inter coding, it may inadvertently increase the bits used for other, conventionally inter-coded blocks in the same frame, because their mvs may have fewer neighboring mvs from which mv prediction can be made. in order to mitigate this, we examined using motion estimation (at both encoder and decoder, without sending any extra information) for dnn-predicted blocks in order to assign mvs to them for the purpose of mv prediction of other, conventionally coded mvs. however, this did not lead to any rate saving, which leads us to conclude that mvs estimated for dnn-predicted blocks were rarely, if ever, selected as mv predictors. hence, we abandoned this idea, and the nal codec did not incorporate this feature.","The proposed frame prediction method in video compression utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate filter coefficients for synthesizing a new frame, referred to as the ""deep frame."" This deep frame is then used as a predictor for the current frame, eliminating the need for additional motion information to be coded. The network architecture supports both uni- and bi-directional prediction, accommodating reference frames at varying distances from the predicted frame. The network uses spatially-varying filters to generate predictions, and the loss function includes terms for mean squared error and feature reconstruction to improve prediction accuracy. The proposed method competes with conventional inter prediction by utilizing previously coded frames for prediction, achieving rate distortion optimization. The network is trained via gradient descent and is capable of handling both uni- and bi-directional prediction effectively."
"in this section, we detail the process of our dnn training. since the performance of the trained network directly affects the coding gain of the proposed frame prediction, choosing the effective learning strategy is very important. some of the training choices, such as the optimizer and learning rate, are based on the exploration by niklaus et al. . accordingly, we employed adamax with default parameter values, and started training from scratch with the learning rate of . we also set the mini-batch size to however, there are also some key differences relative to . since the focus application of our dnn is video coding, we used yuv sequences, rather than rgb. also, our training samples are collected from , which contains diverse raw sequences at various frame rates. we found raw video sequences with , , , and frames per second and various resolutions from to . considering the diversity of resolutions and frame rates in our data, we chose a two-part training strategy consisting of pre-training and ne tuning. a. pre-training with ablation study the purpose of pre-training is to nd, on a relatively small dataset, reasonably good network structure and its weights from which large-scale ne tuning can start. for pre-training, we employ a total of sequences: for training and another for validation. resolutions of these sequences were either or . in order to train a model that is able to operate at various qp values, we adopted fig. validation psnr for the proposed network and its ablated versions. compression augmentation . the key strategy in compres- sion augmentation is to introduce the quantization error into the training process by compressing and decompressing data with multiple quantization parameters. therefore, the network learns to be resilient to quantization errors of different mag- nitudes, arising from different quantization parameters. the following describes the compression augmentation process for our pre-training. first, the chosen sequences were encoded at various qps: , , , , , for a total of qp values. for each qp value, three different coding congurations were used: low delay , low delay p , and random access . during training, either a raw sequence or one of the three coding congurations was chosen randomly, and if the choice was a coded sequence, then one qp was selected randomly from the qp values available. a training sample consists of three collocated patches of size randomly chosen from a triplet of frames within a given sequence. one epoch covers a total of , training frame triplets and validation triplets. in addition to compression augmentation, which was done ofine, we used several forms of online augmentation, namely horizontal and vertical ipping, and reversing the frame order, so that the network gets exposed to a variety of motions. the network was trained for epochs on nvidia geforce gtx gpu with gb ram. in order to assess the the contribution of individual com- ponents of the proposed network, we carry out the ablation study at the pre-training stage. for this purpose, we remove individual components of the network, one at a time, and examine the performance of the resulting ablated network during pre-training, by monitoring the peak signal to noise ratio of predicted patches in the validation set. the components whose impact is examined in this study are: temporal index channel, adaptation layer b, skip connections from b to b, and geometric loss . the results are shown in fig. as psnr vs. mini-batch iteration. the blue curve in fig. is the performance of the full proposed network. in order to examine the effect of the temporal index channel tti, we set it to a dummy constant, same for both input patches. the resulting performance is shown as the orange curve in fig. as seen, without the correct temporal index, the performance of the network drops by about db in psnr, which is the highest drop in this ablation study. hence, we conclude that the temporal index channel is the most important component among those examined in this study. second, we remove b blocks from the proposed network such that the two input patches are stacked and directly fed to b the results are shown as a green curve in fig. according to the results, prediction performance degrades by approximately db compared with the complete network. third, we remove skip connections from the merge point b to each of the outputs b, and the corresponding results are shown as the purple curve in fig. according to the results, excluding these skip connections reduces prediction performance by about db compared with the complete network. hence, these skip connections offer useful support to temporally-variant processing by allowing outputs to depend on the temporal index of the reference frames. lastly, we examined the efcacy of the geometric loss terms . in this case, the network architecture is complete, as shown in fig. , but it is trained with g = in . the results are shown as the red curve in fig. as seen, the prediction performance degrades by about db in this case, hence local geometric features seem to be quite useful in achieving good prediction. b. fine tuning fine tuning starts from the network weights obtained in pre-training. in this stage, a lager dataset and a more sophis- ticated training strategy was used. first, patch triplets were drawn randomly from the training sequences with resolutions ranging from sif to fullhd. patches of size were initially drawn, and from these patches, collocated windows of were extracted. motion augmentation in the form of shifting the reference windows was used to increase the diversity of motions seen by the network. to further enrich the diversity of training samples, we eliminated monotonous triplets those whose entropy in any patch was less than bits per pixel, and those that did not exhibit any pixel value change between any pair of patches. we also estimated optical ow between the rst and last patch in the triplet using the coarsefine method and eliminated patch triplets with zero variance in optical ow magnitudes. we also excluded triplets with extreme motion, where the largest optical ow magnitude was larger than the patch diagonal. finally, the training set was formed with , triplets, and the validation set had , triplets. training was done for epochs starting from the weights obtained in pre-training, and using the same data augmentation strategy as in pre-training. in addition to the dnn that supports both uni-and bi- directional prediction, we trained two other dnns with the same architecture: one specically for uni-directional predic- tion, the other specically for bi-directional prediction. the same data and the same strategy pre-training followed by ne tuning was used for these two dnns as well. these two dnns will be used in the next section for comparison purposes. table ii experimental environment item specication processor intel

"the setup used for experimental evaluation of the proposed approach is shown in table ii. two groups of experiments were carried out: evaluation of frame prediction performance in section v-a and evaluation of video coding performance in section v-b. frame prediction experiments examine only the quality of predicted frames, whereas video coding experiments take into account compressibility of prediction residuals and any side information needed by the decoder to reconstruct the frames. a. frame prediction performance we compare the frame prediction performance of our three networks one for combined uni-/bi-directional prediction and two for separate uni- and bi-directional prediction with the reference network , which is used in , as well as hevc lossless , which allows which allows using original frames as references. the comparison is carried out on the four hevc test sequences listed in table iii. note that the resolution of all sequences is , except for parkscene, which is . this sequence was cropped to starting with the position in the fullhd frame as the top left corner. for uni-directional prediction, the temporal indices of reference frames were = and for the bi-directional case they were = . table iii presents the average psnr of the y-component of predicted frames for each model and hevc. our dnn that performs combined uni-/bi-directional prediction is denoted comb. in the table, while the dnns for separate uni- and bi- directional prediction are denoted sep. as seen in the table, the frames predicted by hevc show higher psnr than any of the dnns , because the predicted samples use motion vectors as side information to minimize the prediction error. however, motion vectors need to be transferred to the decoder, so they become additional cost in rd optimization. according to , the bits needed to represent motion infor- mation usually account for about -% of the total bits spent fig. visual comparison of bi-directionally predicted frames:

bqsquare basketballpass racehorses parkscene fig. bi-directional prediction with varying frame distance. on an inter frame. eventually, hevc pays a heavy price for motion-compensated prediction. by contrast, our method does not require any motion information at the decoder so, in the end, it achieves better rd performance, as demonstrated in the next section. the uni-directional performance of is quite low, under- standably, because the network was not trained for this case. but our models outperform in bi-directional prediction in three out of four sequences. the only exception is bqsquare, with very low motion, where all models do fairly well. among our models, while separately trained models are clearly better than the combined model, the difference is not large, less than db. most importantly, the combined model outper- forms in most bi-directional cases, even though it can support both uni- and bi-directional prediction, whereas supports only bi-directional prediction. several visual examples of bi-directional prediction are shown in fig. the bqsquare sequence in the rst row is characterized by camera panning at a distance, with high frame rate. thus the difference between consecutive frames is very small, and the the predicted frame is fairly accurate (around db) for all models. only subtle differences can be found in the zoomed-in face region shown in the bottom right of each frame. in the second row, the basketballpass sequence has much more complicated motion, and the differences in predicted frames are easily noticeable. the basketball is poorly predicted by hevc and especially the network from , as shown in the second and third column, respectively. even though hevc achieves high average psnr on this sequence, distortion on high-speed objects such as the basketball is visible. meanwhile, our models last two columns seem to do a better job on the basketball. with the racehorses sequence in the third row, all network models struggle to reconstruct the horses leg, but our models made better effort to preserve context around the leg. finally, with the parkscene sequence in the last row, the proposed models again provides better prediction than , which suffers from the noticeable warp on the pillar along the the arm. the frame predicted by hevc is good overall, despite some small blocking artifacts. for bi-directional prediction to be used in hierarchical b coding in the ra conguration, prediction is sometimes required from more distant frames, not just the immediately preceding and succeeding frame. therefore, in fig. , we evaluate bi-directional prediction accuracy from a previous and a future frame at various distances from the current frame. the gure shows average y-psnr (in db) of the predicted frame vs. frame distance, averaged over all frames in the corresponding sequences where such bi- directional prediction is possible. as above, hevc prediction provides the highest psnr with the benet of motion vectors. the proposed dnns, both the separately trained bi-directional dnn and the combined uni-/bi-directional dnn, outperform the network from in all cases except bqsquare at frame distance of at the same time, except in bqsquare at frame distance of , our separately trained bi-directional dnn is slightly better than our combined uni-/bi-directional dnn, most notably in parkscene at larger frame distances. b. video coding performance in this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed frame prediction in video coding. the benchmark is the latest video coding standard, high efciency video coding . the proposed method competes with hevc inter and intra prediction in inter frames in terms of the rd cost , where the proposed method is selected when jdnn < jinter, jintra. as shown in table ii, the proposed prediction method is implemented based on hm- and the dnn is implemented in pytorch. python embedding library is used to embed the dnn into hm-. during video coding, forward operation of the dnn to perform frame prediction is executed on the gpu . however, due to the memory limitations of the gpu, it is impossible to generate the prediction frame larger than resolution. therefore, larger frames are split into multiple tiles with a maximum size of wvga. then tile-wise prediction is performed and the predicted frame is assembled from predicted tiles. for evaluation, three coding congurations (ld, lp, and ra) that allow inter-frame coding under the common test conditions with the common test sequences are employed with four quantization parameters qp {, , , }. in the ld and lp congurations, only uni- directional prediction is available using two previously coded frames before updating the reference picture set of the current frame. for the ra conguration, bi-directional prediction is performed when the coded frames with a max- imum difference of from the poc of the current frame are available before updating the rps. larger distances can be allowed, but the computational complexity increases while prediction performance reduces at larger distances, so we felt the poc difference of up to is a good compromise. table iv shows the coding performance compared to the hevc for various congurations. we measure the coding performance using bd-bitrate . we show the performance of both the separate uni- and bi-directional models (sep. in the table), as well as the combined uni-/bi-directional model . the proposed method reduces the bitrate for the luminance component in all test cases. there is some increase for the chrominance components of one sequence (bqterrace, lp and ld congurations for comb), but considering that the chrominance components are much smaller than luminance, this increase is negligible compared to the overall savings. and on average, the bitrate of chrominance components across all sequences is reduced. https://docs.python.org//extending/ for the lp conguration, the proposed method achieves the largest bits savings of up to % and % with the separate model and the combined model, respectively, for the sequence fourpeople. in general, signicant bit reductions are shown in larger resolution sequences in classes a, b and e. compared with the lp conguration, the coding gains are somewhat lower in the ld conguration, especially in class b sequences. however, gains in class e sequences are still strong. similarly, in the ra conguration, the coding gains are somewhat less than in lp, but comparable to the coding gains in the ld conguration. the largest luminance coding gains in this case are % with sep and % with comb, achieved on the sequences partyscene and peopleonstreet, respectively. moreover, signicant bit savings were shown in class c and d. overall, the proposed method achieves higher coding gain in the lp conguration compared to ld and ra cong- urations. this is likely due to the fact that it uses two reference frames and content-adaptive lters derived by the dnn, compared to hevc, which uses a single reference frame in this conguration. the gain also depends on the sequence complexity, as will be discussed later in this section. as could be expected, the combined uni-/bi-directional dnn offers somewhat lower gains than separate uni- and bi- directional dnns by about %-%, but it supports both forms of prediction, so it allows a simpler video coding system design, which may be preferred in many applications. the last two rows of the table show the difference in encoding and decoding time, dened as tp = tp roposed,p thm,p % where p {enc, dec}, and tp roposed,p and thm,p represent the the total elapsed time for the proposed method and the original hm-, respectively. due to the complexity of running a deep model, the encoding run time increases by - %, depending on the conguration. however, the decoding time increases much more signicantly. this is because decod- ing time is small to start with, and the complexity of frame prediction with the proposed method is symmetric (i.e., it takes the same amount of time) at the encoder and the decoder, so compared to an initially small decoding time, running a deep model adds signicant complexity. as with other envisioned applications of deep models, run-time complexity is one of the bottlenecks, and clever solutions will need to be found to get this technology into end-user products. in addition to the psnr-based bd-bitrate analysis in ta- ble iv, we also perform bd-bitrate analysis with ms-ssim used instead of psnr. the results are shown in table v. these results indicate the average bitrate saving of the proposed method compared to hevc at the same perceptual quality level . the results are qualitatively similar to the results in table iv, with savings ranging from %-%. the largest savings are again achieved on sequences in class e, followed by classes a and b. in fig. , we show the percentage area of the frame where a particular coding mode is selected. in order to

the gures, we see that the proposed frame prediction takes over from inter and skip modes in all cases, but more so in the ra conguration in fig. however, looking at the bd-bitrate gain for the bqmall sequence in table iv, the highest gain is achieved in the lp conguration. this is because, the more inter blocks are taken over by the proposed method, the more gain is achieved, because bits are saved by not transmitting motion vectors and associated information. further, we analyze bit savings in different parts of the bitstream. table vi shows the average bit reduction percentage table vi

at least % of bits compared to hevc. as expected, bit savings by sep are slightly higher than those achieved by comb, but comb model still shows solid savings over all congurations. to further investigate the reasons behind larger coding gains in class e in table iv, we rst note that class e sequences are fairly static, consisting of static background and slowly-moving objects. we therefore select a group of more dynamic sequences for comparison: basketballdrive, race- horsesc, blowingbubbles. these dynamic sequences contain camera motion/moving background, as well as faster-moving objects. the average bd-bitrate from table iv in the ld fig. selected coding modes for class e and dynamic sequences over various qp values in the ld conguration. table vii bit reduction percentage in

qp increases, at the expense of inter prediction. the area over which our method is used at qp= in dynamic sequences is twice as large as the corresponding area in class e sequences . still, larger area does not translate into larger coding gain, because our gain is actually larger in class e sequences. this is due to the fact that the bitrate for class e sequences is relatively small to start with, due to the very frequent use of the skip mode, so even a slight reduction in absolute bits could represent a larger table viii bd-bitrate relative to hm- with the ra configuration class sequence

larger bit reduction in class e sequences is mostly due to the much reduced bitrate for inter prediction. finally, we compare the coding efciency of the proposed method to that of lei et al. , which directly uses the network from . since the borrowed network was designed for interpolation mid-way between two frames, could only test and provide results for the ra conguration. hence, we carry out this comparison on the ra conguration only. following the experimental setup in , we re-implemented our proposed method in hm-, and evaluated the coding performance on sequences in class b, c and d for seconds with qp {, , , }. table viii shows bd-bitrate of each method against hm-. overall, our separately trained dnn model for bi-directional prediction is the best overall, with the highest average reduction in bitrate and providing the best performance in out of sequences in this test. lei et al. results are the second best overall, with the average bit rate reduction of % and top performance in out of sequences. they achieve especially good performance on bqsquare, which signicantly boosts their average bit saving. our combined uni-/bi-directional dnn comes in third with a slightly lower overall bit rate reduction of %. however, even our combined dnn provides better coding gain than lei et al. in out of sequences. furthermore, despite the fact that dnn-based uni-directional prediction was not used in this test, it is worth remembering that our combined dnn is the only one of the three models that supports both uni- and bi-directional prediction, and still is competitive with the other two models.","In the experimental results section, two groups of experiments were conducted: frame prediction performance and video coding performance. The frame prediction performance analysis compared three neural networks for frame prediction against HEVC, showing that the proposed method achieved better rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially in bi-directional prediction scenarios. The video coding performance evaluation against HEVC demonstrated that the proposed method reduced the bitrate for the luminance component in all test cases, with significant bit reductions seen in larger resolution sequences. The proposed method outperformed HEVC in terms of coding efficiency, particularly in terms of bitrate reduction, when compared against another existing method. Overall, the separately trained DNN model for bi-directional prediction showed the best performance, followed by a method using a network from a previous study, and the combined uni-/bi-directional DNN."
"we presented a deep neural network for frame prediction that can be used to improve video coding efciency. the dnn operates at both encoder and decoder, and uses previously decoded frames to predict the current frame. this form of prediction is signalled as a separate prediction mode, and can be used within rd optimization to compete with other prediction modes. although it is a form of inter prediction, it does not require any motion vectors to be transmitted. three dnns were trained for this purpose: two for separate uni- and bi-directional prediction, and one that supports both uni- and bi-directional prediction, the rst of its kind, to our knowledge. the dnns were evaluated on common test sequences and various coding congurations, and demon- strated to bring signicant coding gains relative to hevc. furthermore, advantages over the recent work on dnn-based frame prediction for video coding was also demonstrated.","A deep neural network was introduced for frame prediction in video coding to enhance efficiency. This neural network operates in both the encoder and decoder, using previously decoded frames to predict the current frame without the need for transmitting motion vectors. Three neural networks were trained, including uni- and bi-directional prediction models, as well as a unique model supporting both. Evaluation on test sequences and coding configurations showed substantial coding gains compared to HEVC, surpassing recent DNN-based frame prediction techniques in video coding."

"impossibility and uncertainty theorems in ai value alignment or why your agi should not have a utility function peter eckersley partnership on ai & eff pde@partnershiponai.org abstract utility functions or their equivalents (value functions, objective functions, loss functions, reward functions, preference orderings) are a central tool in most current machine learning systems. these mechanisms for dening goals and guiding optimization run into practical and conceptual difculty when there are independent, multi-dimensional objectives that need to be pursued simultaneously and cannot be reduced to each other. ethicists have proved several impossibility theorems that stem from this origin; those results appear to show that there is no way of formally specifying what it means for an outcome to be good for a population without violating strong human ethical intuitions (in such cases, the objective function is a social welfare function). we argue that this is a practical problem for any machine learning system (such as medical decision support systems or autonomous weapons) or rigidly rule-based bureaucracy that will make high stakes decisions about human lives: such systems should not use objective functions in the strict mathematical sense. we explore the alternative of using uncertain objectives, represented for instance as partially ordered preferences, or as probability distributions over total orders. we show that previously known impossibility theorems can be transformed into uncertainty theorems in both of those settings, and prove lower bounds on how much uncertainty is implied by the impossibility results. we close by proposing two conjectures about the relationship between uncertainty in objectives and severe unintended consequences from ai systems.","The discussion focuses on the limitations and uncertainties surrounding utility functions in artificial intelligence (AI) value alignment. Utility functions are commonly used in machine learning systems to define goals and guide optimization but pose challenges when dealing with independent, multi-dimensional objectives that cannot be easily reconciled. Ethicists have proven various impossibility theorems, highlighting the difficulty in formalizing what constitutes a good outcome for a population without conflicting with human ethical intuitions. It is argued that practical AI systems, such as medical decision support or autonomous weapons, should not strictly rely on objective functions. Instead, the exploration of uncertain objectives, including partially ordered preferences or probability distributions, is suggested. The concept of uncertainty theorems is introduced as a transformation of impossibility theorems in these alternate settings, with lower bounds detailing the amount of uncertainty implied. Furthermore, two conjectures are proposed regarding the implications of uncertainty in objectives on the potential unintended consequences of AI systems."
"conversations about the safety of self-driving cars often turn into discussion of trolley problems, where the vehicle must make a decision between several differently disastrous outcomes [, , , , , ]. for the engineers building robots and machine learning systems, however, these questions seem somewhat absurd; the relevant challenges are correctly identifying obstacles, pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles from noisy and unreliable data sources, and reasonably predicting the consequences of the vehicles control mechanisms in various conditions. the conceivable circumstances under which a self-driving cars systems might accurately foresee and deliberately act on a genuine trolley problem without having been able to avoid that problem in the rst place are a tiny portion of possibility space, and one that has arguably received a disproportionate amount of attention. the views expressed in this paper are those of the author alone, and should not be taken as positions of the partnership on ai, its members, or the electronic frontier foundation. there are related and more fruitful questions like, how should self-driving cars make trade-offs between time saved by driving more aggressively and accident risk? see for instance . arxiv:v mar there are, however, other kinds of ai systems for which ethical discussions about the value of lives, about who should exist or keep existing, are more genuinely relevant. the clearest category is systems that are designed to make decisions affecting the welfare or existence of people in the future, rather than systems that only have to make such decisions in highly atypical scenarios. examples of such systems include: autonomous or semi-autonomous weapons systems (which may have to make trade-offs between threats to and the lives of friendly and enemy combatants, friendly and enemy civilians, and combatants who have surrendered). risk assessment algorithms in criminal justice contexts (which at least notionally are making trade-offs between risk to society and the harm that life-shortening incarceration does to individual defendants in the criminal justice system and their families). decision support systems in high-stakes bureucratic settings. for instance a system that helps to allocate scarce resources like doctors time, laboratory test access and money in a medical system would implicitly or explicitly have to make trade-offs between the life span, quality of life, and fertility of numerous people. autonomous types of open-ended ai taking important actions without their designers input. governmental organizations already have to make decisions that involve weighing benets to present or future people against risks to present or future people, or trading off benets to one group against benets of another sort to another. therefore, we might think that the decision-making tools that they employ could be implemented by any narrow ai system that has to make similar choices. a variety of metrics have been proposed and used to perform cost-benet analyses in such situations. for example, the us environmental protection agency uses the value of a statistical life metric, which identies the cost of an intervention that puts people at risk with peoples willingness to pay to avoid similar risks or the qaly metric used by the uks national health service, which assigns a given value to each life-year saved or lost in expectation, weighted by the quality of that life. the problem is that existing impossibility theorems apply equally to each of these metrics and therefore to an ai system that implements them.","The text discusses the safety challenges of self-driving cars, focusing on the practical aspects faced by engineers in building efficient systems. It highlights the limitations of current ethical discussions, emphasizing the need to consider more relevant questions such as trade-offs between time saved and accident risk. It also mentions other AI systems, like autonomous weapons and risk assessment algorithms, where ethical decisions concerning lives are more crucial. The text touches on decision-making tools used in various contexts, including cost-benefit analyses with metrics like the value of a statistical life and QALY. However, it points out that existing impossibility theorems pose challenges to implementing these metrics effectively in AI systems."
"example: an impossibility theorem in utilitarian population ethics economists and ethicists study individual utility functions and their aggregations, such as social welfare functions, social choice functions and formal axiologies, and have discovered various impos- sibility theorems about these functions. perhaps the most famous of these is arrows impossibility theorem , which applies to social choice or voting. it shows there is no satisfactory way to compute societys preference ordering via an election in which members of society vote with their individual preference orderings. fortunately, arrows theorem results from some constraints (incomparability of individuals preferences, and the need for incentive compatibility) which may not apply to ai systems. unfortunately, ethicists have discovered other situations in which the problem isnt learning and computing the tradeoff between agents objectives, but that there simply may not be such a satisfactory tradeoff at all. the mere addition paradox was the rst result of this sort, but the literature now has many of these impossibility results. for example, arrhenius shows that all total orderings of populations must entail one of the following six problematic conclusions, stated informally: the repugnant conclusion for any population of very happy people, there exists a much larger population with lives barely worth living that is better than this very happy population (this affects the ""maximise total wellbeing"" objective). the creation of autonomous weapons systems may well be an extremely bad idea (see, eg , but one of the main arguments made by their proponents is that such systems will be able to make ethical decisions in real world equivalents of trolley situations at least as well as if not better than human pilots, and some military-funded work in that direction is already underway . the sadistic conclusion suppose we start with a population of very happy people. for any proposed addition of a sufciently large number of people with positive welfare, there is a small number of horribly tortured people that is a preferable addition. the very anti-egalitarian conclusion for any population of two or more people which has uniform happiness, there exists another population of the same size which has lower total and average happiness, and is less equal, but is better. anti-dominance population b can be better than population a even if a is the same size as population b, and every person in a is happier than their equivalent in b. anti-addition it is sometimes bad to add a group of people b to a population a (where the people in group b are worse of than those in a), but better to add a group c that is larger than b, and worse off than b. extreme priority there is no n such that create of n lives of very high positive welfare is sufcient benet to compensate for the reduction from very low positive welfare to slightly negative welfare for a single person (informally, the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many). the structure of the impossibility theorem is to show that no objective function or social welfare function can simultaneously satisfy these principles, because they imply a cycle of world states, each of which in turn is required to be better than the next. the structure of that proof is shown in figure a.","The text discusses impossibility theorems in ethics, focusing on the practical challenges in utilitarian population ethics. The most famous theorem, Arrow's impossibility theorem, demonstrates the inability to compute society's preference ordering through voting due to various constraints. Ethicists have identified other situations where no satisfactory trade-off exists, such as the repugnant conclusion and sadistic conclusion. These scenarios challenge the idea of maximizing total well-being or welfare. The text outlines a series of problematic conclusions and highlights the complexity of ethical decision-making, especially in relation to AI systems and the creation of autonomous weapons. The impossibility theorems aim to show that no single objective function or social welfare function can satisfy all ethical principles simultaneously due to inherent contradictions."
"arrheniuss unpublished book contains a collection of many more uncertainty theorems. here is the simplest, which is a more compelling version of partts mere addition paradox. it shows the impossibility of an objective function satisfying the following requirements simultaneously: the quality condition: there is at least one perfectly equal population with very high welfare which is at least as good as any population with very low positive welfare, other things being equal. the inequality aversion condition: for any triplet of welfare levels a, b, and c, a higher than b, and b higher than c, and for any population a with welfare a, there is a larger population c with welfare c such that a perfectly equal population b of the same size as ac and with welfare b is at least as good as ac, other things being equal. the egalitarian dominance condition: if population a is a perfectly equal population of the same size as population b, and every person in a has higher welfare than every person in b, then a is better than b, other things being equal. the dominance addition condition: an addition of lives with positive welfare and an increase in the welfare in the rest of the population doesnt make a population worse, other things being equal. the cyclic structure of the proof is shown in figure b.","Arrhenius' unpublished book presents various uncertainty theorems, including a compelling version of Parfit's mere addition paradox. The impossibility theorem highlighted in the text demonstrates that it is not possible to have an objective function that simultaneously satisfies the quality condition, inequality aversion condition, egalitarian dominance condition, and dominance addition condition. This theorem shows that it is impossible to create a scenario where a perfectly equal population with very high welfare is at least as good as any population with very low positive welfare, among other conditions. The cyclic structure of the proof for this theorem is illustrated in Figure B."
"the particular impossibility theorems summarized above, and those in the related literature, result from the incompatibility of several different utilitarian objectives: maximizing total wellbeing, maximizing average wellbeing, and avoiding suffering. similar problems are also likely to arise when considering almost any kinds of competing objectives, such as attempting to simultaneously maximize different notions of wellbeing, freedom, knowledge, fairness, or other widely accepted or domain- specic ethical goods . we conjecture that the literature contains more impossibility theorems about happiness or wellbeing simply because that objective has been subjected to mathematical modeling and study for well over a hundred years, while much less effort has gone into the others. the ""maximise average wellbeing"" objective fails this dramatically; in that case the proposed positive addition can be just below the welfare level of the original group, but in general for other objective functions the proposed addition may be only slightly above this is most notably true in the economics literature , though there are now some efforts from the machine learning direction too . recent work has begun to focus on fairness in decisionmaking contexts in particular, and is already producing its own impossibility results.","The text discusses how ethical impossibility theorems arise from conflicting utilitarian objectives such as maximizing total well-being, average well-being, and avoiding suffering. Similar challenges can emerge when striving to balance different ethical goods like well-being, freedom, knowledge, and fairness. The literature primarily focuses on happiness and well-being due to extensive mathematical modeling, with less attention on other objectives. For instance, the objective of maximizing average well-being can fail dramatically, leading to proposed additions falling short of the original group's welfare level. Impossibility theorems are increasingly being explored in decision-making contexts, particularly concerning fairness, resulting in new insights and challenges."
"arrheniuss impossibility results and others like them are quite troubling. they show that we do not presently have a trustworthy framework for making decisions about the welfare or existence of people in the future, and are representative of a broader problem with the inability of the objective functions to reasonably optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously. next we will consider ve possible responses to these impossibility theorems:","The text discusses how impossibility results, such as Arrhenius's, highlight the lack of a reliable framework for making decisions about future welfare or existence. These results also point to challenges in optimizing objective functions for multiple objectives simultaneously. The following section explores five possible responses to these impossibility theorems."
"one response may be to claim that the stakes are simply low for present ai systems that only make small-scale changes to the world. agi systems, if they exist, may one day need to confront impossibility theorems or difcult conicting objectives in some cases, but none of that is presently relevant. unfortunately, it appears that although the stakes are indeed much lower at present, the fundamental tensions that drive these paradoxes are already at play in decisions made by bureaucracies and decision support systems, and small scale decisions can easily violate constraints we would want to see respected. asking for human feedback helps, but humans often miss important ethical principles, and can easily make chains of decisions that have problematic consequences in proportion to their degree of power or agency. cases of particular concern are those where ml or algorithmic heuristics are deployed in decision support tools that humans are inadequately inclined to question.","Present AI systems may seem to have low stakes due to making small-scale changes, but fundamental tensions driving paradoxes are already evident in decisions by bureaucracies and decision support systems. Small-scale decisions can violate constraints and lead to problematic consequences. Human feedback may help, but humans can overlook important ethics and make decisions with unintended outcomes. Deploying machine learning or algorithmic heuristics in decision support tools without sufficient scrutiny is a concern."
"one might argue that impossibility theorems are only a problem for an ai system if we are attempting to explicitly dene an objective function, rather than letting an ai system acquire its objective function in a piecemeal way via a method like co-operative inverse reinforcement learning or other forms of human guidance . using human feedback to construct objective functions as neural networks appears to be a promising direction, but if the output of that network is mathematically a utility function or total ordering, these problems will persist at all stages of network training. the theorems do not just reect a tension between principles that agents are committed to: they are also reected in the decisions that human supervisors will make when presented with a sequence of pairwise choices. therefore, although learning objectives from humans may be a prudent design choice, such learning systems will still need to either violate the ethical intuitions that underpin the various impossibility theorems or explicitly incorporate uncertainty into their outputs .","Impossibility theorems can be a challenge for AI systems when trying to define an objective function. Approaches like cooperative inverse reinforcement learning or human guidance for objective function construction can be promising. However, if neural networks output utility functions or total orderings, challenges persist during network training. These theorems highlight tensions between agent principles and influence human supervisors' decisions. Learning objectives from humans can be a good design choice, but systems may need to either breach ethical intuitions or integrate uncertainty into their outputs."
"one natural response to impossibility theorems is to try harder to gure out good ways of making tradeoffs between the competing objectives that underlie them in arrheniuss paradox these are total wellbeing, average wellbeing, and avoidance of suffering. this tradeoff can be simple, such as trying to dene a linear exchange rate between those objectives. unfortunately, linear exchange rates between a total quantity and an average quantity do not make conceptual sense, and it is easy to nd cases under which one of them totally outweighs the other. one can try more complicated strategies such as trying to write down convex tradeoffs or imagining an explicit parliament where different ethical theories and objectives vote against each although one philosophical concern is that methods like cirl may already commit us to more person- affecting views within ethics by pooling the preferences of existing agents. this could lead to the implementation of principles that satisfy undesirable axioms like dictatorship of the present . for instance, if a linear weighting is chosen that appears to make sense for the present population of the world, a change in technology that allowed a much larger population might quickly cause the average wellbeing to cease affecting the preferred outcome in any meaningful way. other, are weighed probabilistically, or are combined using a function like softmin unfortunately all of these approaches contain a version of the exchange rate problem, and none of them actually escape the impossibility results: for instance, using any unbounded monotonic non-linear weighting on total utility will eventually lead to the repugnant conclusion .","In response to impossibility theorems, efforts are made to find ways to balance competing objectives in scenarios like Arrhenius's paradox, which involves total well-being, average well-being, and avoidance of suffering. Various strategies are explored, such as defining linear exchange rates between objectives or using more complex methods like convex tradeoffs or parliamentary decision-making. However, concerns arise about committing to certain ethical views and undesirable outcomes like the ""dictatorship of the present."" Methods like CIRL may lead to problematic results if preferences are pooled, and traditional approaches still face challenges like the exchange rate problem and can't avoid impossibility results, such as the repugnant conclusion."
"another type of response one that is commonly pursued in the population ethics literature is to argue that although each of the axioms above strikes us as undesirable, at least one of them ought to be accepted in some form. for example, it has been argued that although the repugnant conclusion might appear undesirable, it is an acceptable consequence of an objective function over populations . we argue that, given the high levels of uncertainty and the lack of political consensus about which of these axioms we ought to accept it would, at present, be irresponsible to explicitly adopt one of the axioms outlined above.","In the population ethics literature, it is common to accept at least one of the undesirable axioms presented, such as the repugnant conclusion, as an acceptable consequence of an objective function over populations. However, due to high levels of uncertainty and a lack of political consensus on which axiom to adopt, it is seen as irresponsible to explicitly choose one at this time."
"the last solution, and the one which we believe may be the most appropriate for deploying ai systems in high-stakes domains, is to add explicit mathematical uncertainty to objective functions. there are at least two ways of doing this: one is to make the objective a mathematical partial order, in which the system can prefer one of two outcomes, believe they are equal, or believe that they are incommensurate. we discuss that approach and demonstrate uncertainty theorems in that formalization in section a second approach is to allow objective functions to have some level of condence or uncertainty about which of two objectives is better (eg, were % sure that a is better, and % sure that b is better). we discuss that framing and show the existence of formal uncertainty theorems in that framework in section uncertainty theorems of the rst kind: via partially ordered objective functions it is already the case that in some problems where humans attempt to provide oversight to ai systems, it is pragmatically better to allow the human to express uncertainty or indifference when asked which of two actions is better. but such systems presently try to construct a totally ordered objective function, and simply interpret these messages from users as containing either no information about the correct ordering or implying that the two choices are close to as good as each other . we believe that another type of interpretation is sometimes necessary, which is that the human is torn between objectives that fundamentally cannot be traded off against each other. we can represent this notion with a partially ordered objective function that sometimes says the comparison between world states cannot be known with certainty. cyclical impossibility theorems like those surveyed in sections and can be viewed as evidence of this uncertainty. here we prove a lower bound on how much uncertainty is evidenced by each such theorem. see https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/classify/softmin.html. softmin is the counterpart to the more widely discussed softmax function. it prioritises whichever of its inputs is currently the smallest, is not totally unresponsive to increases in the other inputs. arrhenius considered this direction of interpretation , but with much more uncertainty than turned out to be necessary: [a person arguing that some actions in the mere addition paradox are neither right nor wrong] could perhaps motivate her position by saying that moral theory has nothing to say about cases that involve cyclical evaluations and that lacks a maximal alternative since these are beyond the scope of moral theory. compare with the theory of quantum mechanics in physics and the impossibility of deriving the next position and velocity of an electron from the measurement of its current position and velocity (often expressed by saying that it is impossible to determine both the position and velocity of an electron). it turns out that only two of the edges in the cycle need to be uncertain. note that broomes vague neutral-level theory is one plausible example of an uncertain social welfare function. suppose that w is the set of possible states of the world, and that there is a an impossibility theorem tc showing that there is no totally ordered denition of better z over w that satises a set of constraints {c, c, ..cn} over the comparison function z : w w {<, >, =}. each of these constraints are motivated by strong human ethical intuitions, and insist that for a set of pairs of inputs x and y, a takes some value. we use the notation x ci z y to indicate that ci requires that x z y for some x and y). z also has the usual properties of total orderings: antisymmetry: a z b b z a a = b transitivity: a z b b z c a z c totality: a z b b z a suppose further that t is provable by providing a series of example worlds {w, w, wn} such that: w c z w c z cn z wn and wn cn z w violating transitivity, tc shows that no totally ordered z that satises {c, ..cn} can exist. this is a cyclic impossibility theorem. now suppose we attempt to escape tc by looking for a partially ordered notion of better z with a comparison function z : w w {<, >, =, ? =}. by necessity, the uncertain case is symmetric: a ? = b b ? = a. in some instances some of the requirements x ci z y of some constraint ci will be failed, but only weakly: they will result in incomparability x ? =z y rather than violation, x >z y. we call this uncertain satisfaction of a constraint. theorem: a cyclic impossibility theorem tc can be transformed into an uncertainty theorem only if two or more constraints are uncertainly satised. proof: we might hope that it would be possible to only uncertainly satisfy one of the constraints {c, c, ..cn}, while fully satisfying all of the others. but this is impossible, and at minimum two of the constrains will be uncertain. the proof is by contradiction. assume w.l.o.g. that cn is the only uncertainly satised constraint, such that w c z w c z cn z wn but wn cn ? =z w however by transitivity and , we know w cn z wn, which by the symmetry of ? = contradicts . so in order to treat tc as uncertainty theorem, at least two constraints must be uncertainly satised. qed. the structure of this transformation from cyclic impossibility to uncertainty is shown in figure a and b for the two theorems introduced in sections and the largest difculty with accepting partially ordered, uncertain objectives is knowing how an agent should act when facing ethically uncertain choices. there are a few possible strategies, including: doing nothing, asking for human supervision, choosing randomly, searching harder for a clearly- preferable action, treating all of the uncertain options as equally good, or conducting research to try to break the tie in some way. none of these options are ideal. but the arrhenius impossibility theorem a mere addition paradox variant (ar- rheniuss second theorem). figure : examples of impossibility theorems and our corresponding uncertainty theorems depending on the application domain, some of them will be workable. an may be necessary for ml systems deployed in high stakes, safety-critical applications.","Adding mathematical uncertainty to objective functions in AI systems can be a beneficial approach for high-stakes domains. Two ways of incorporating uncertainty involve making the objective a mathematical partial order or assigning confidence levels to objective functions. By allowing for uncertainty in objective functions, systems can better handle human preferences that cannot be easily ranked. It is essential to transform cyclic impossibility theorems into uncertainty theorems by satisfying at least two constraints uncertainly. Implementing partially ordered, uncertain objectives presents challenges in decision-making, prompting the need for strategies such as seeking human guidance or conducting further research to resolve ethical uncertainties.

"a second way to encode uncertainty about a systems objectives, is to use what we will call an uncertain objective function or uncertain ordering. suppose that an uncertain ordering is denoted by: zk = p the uncertain ordering zk is a function returning the probability, based on the available prior philo- sophical and practical evidence k, that one of the states a is better. conversely, zk = p = zk = rather than allowing a non-zero probability of explicit equality.) this formulation can for instance be justied by holding that there is some ultimately correct total ordering of states of the world, we just dont know what it is. the framing is also compatible with the claim that the correct ordering is ultimately unknowable. uncertain orderings are a convenient formalization if the comparison function is itself the output of a machine learning model to be trained from human guidance (ideally from a large number of people, over a large number of real or hypothetical scenarios). this formulation is also convenient for systems that do not have a clear architectural separation between abstract objectives and the predictive reasoning about the real world that is necessary to accomplish them. uncertain orderings are also a more exible basis for strategies/decision rules than the partially ordered objective functions discussed in section if a partial order returns ? =, the agent is left torn and unable to act. but with with a distribution zk decisions rules such as take an action drawn via weighted probability from those that are sufciently likely to be best are available. or for systems where more supervision is available, take the action that is most likely to be best, provided it beats the second best action by some probability margin ; otherwise, ask for supervision. in this framing, whether a given ethical constraint or principle has been violated becomes a proba- bilistic matter. there will almost always be some probability that zk violates each constraint, unless all of the corresponding output probabilities have converged to or . decision rules based on zk will by mathematical necessity sometimes violate the constraints, at least by inaction. but if the actions are sampled from a space of reasonably supported ones, then at least the violating actions will not systematically prioritize some objectives over others, and will be more similar to the way that wise and cautious humans react to difcult moral dilemmas. what do we know about the values zk? consider a series of cyclical constraints c, c, cn across points x, x, ..xn, with n , where ci requires zk if the uncertain ordering has emitted values for some of the pairwise comparisons zk, this imposes some bounds on the comparison that spans them, zk. for transitivity, in order for the spanning comparison to be in a given direction, at least one of the pairwise comparisons must also be in that direction. so for the simple two-step case over x, x, x: zk zk + zk note that the pairwise probabilities are additive because the bound is least tight when those probabili- ties are disjoint. or more generally: zk n x i= zk this also applies in the reverse direction: zk n x i= zk zk n x i= zk zk n x i= zk so we have both upper and lower bounds for zk : n x i= zk zk n x i= zk in the special case where x, x, xn correspond to points ordered by the constraints c, ccn of an n step cyclic impossibility theorem, the satisfaction of ci means zk and the probability of violation zk we might ask, what is the lowest probability that we can obtain for any of these chances of violating a constraint? or in other words, what is the lower bound b that can be achieved on the odds of each such possible violation? this has been termed a satiscing or quantilized decision rule . a similar rule is the contextual-- greedy reinforcement learning policy proposed in ; both of these decision rules combine explore/exploit tradeoffs with the notion that certain actions might be too costly or dangerous to take as experiments in certain situations. in contextual--greedy this is formalized via annotating certain states as high level critical situations, whereas threshholding probabilities views all pairs as potentially critical. b = min zk n max i= { zk, zk, .. , zk, ..} = min zk n max i= {zk, zk, .. , zk, ..} then by applying the constraint from , we get: b min zk n max i= { n x j= zk, zk, .. , zk, ..} by symmetry, we know that this bound will be minimized when all the values zk are equal to a single value z: b min z max{ , z, .. , z, ..} b min z max{ n + z, z} since in the domain z the function f = n + z monotonically increasing from n, and the function g = z is monotonically decreasing from , and the functions intersect, the minimax is satised at that intersection: z = z + n + nz = n + nz z = n n at which point we have: b n n b n this bound is a minimum uncertainty theorem for uncertain objective functions: when confronted with a n-step cyclic ethical impossibility theorem, no choice of uncertain ordering can reduce the probabilities of constraint violation so that they are all below n. in practice, systems that estimate which of two outcomes are better than another could emit values like zk that violate these constraints, but in such circumstances the outputs could no longer be interpreted as probabilities over a well-dened ordering of states, and the agent would exhibit self-contradictory, non-transitive preferences.","Uncertainty theorems of the second kind involve using uncertain objective functions or uncertain orderings to encode uncertainty about a system's objectives. Uncertain orderings are defined by probabilities and can be justified by the idea that there is an ultimately correct total ordering of states, which is unknown. These uncertain orderings are useful when the comparison function is derived from a machine learning model trained with human guidance. Decision rules based on uncertain orderings allow for more flexibility and can handle ethical constraints as probabilistic matters. The text also discusses bounds on comparisons and presents a minimum uncertainty theorem for uncertain objective functions in the context of ethical impossibility theorems. Systems that estimate better outcomes might emit values that violate constraints, leading to non-transitive preferences."
"we shown the existence of ethical uncertainty theorems for objectives formulated either as partial orders over states, or probability distributions over total orderings. other formalizations are possible and deserve investigation. where constraints are sourced from human intuition, there is a question of how they should be interpreted, prioritized and kept in data structures. for instance, rather than treating all constraints as equally important, and all violations of constraints as equally serious, it might be better to learn or specify weightings for each constraint, to measure the degree to which a given action violates a constraint, and to reconstruct ethical uncertainty theorems in such a framework. alternatively, when building ai systems that learn their objectives from the combination of observed world states and human feedback, it may be computationally inconvenient to require the agent to produce a probability distribution over total orderings at each moment, or even to draw samples from such an object. instead, learned objectives may be viewed as a set of pairwise comparisons that are too sparse and unstable to be taken as a commitment to any global total order (or probability distribution over global total orders). in such a frame, the goal of transitive preferences and avoidance of cycles is an aspiration, and may require both record keeping and regret for past actions that now seem sub-optimal due to subsequent learning of objectives. the appropriate framing of ethical uncertainty theorems in such settings would be productive further work.","The text discusses the existence of ethical uncertainty theorems for objectives represented as partial orders over states or probability distributions over total orderings. It suggests exploring different formalizations and ways to interpret and prioritize constraints sourced from human intuition, proposing the idea of assigning weightings to constraints and measuring violations. Additionally, it mentions the challenge of requiring AI systems to generate probability distributions over total orderings continuously and proposes viewing learned objectives as sparse pairwise comparisons without a commitment to a global total order. The text highlights the importance of transitive preferences and avoiding cycles, emphasizing the need for record-keeping and regret in cases where actions become sub-optimal due to evolving objectives. Further work on framing ethical uncertainty theorems in such settings is recommended."
"uncertainty, pluralism, and instrumental convergence many of the concerns in the literature about the difculty of aligning hypothetical future agi systems to human values are motivated by the risk of instrumental convergence of those systems the adoption of sub-goals that are dis-empowering of humans and other agents . the crux of the instrumental convergence problem is that given almost any very specic objective, the chance that other agents will use their agency to work against the rst agents objective is high, and it may therefore be rational to take steps or adopt a sub-goal to remove those actors agency. we believe that the emergence of instrumental subgoals is deeply connected to moral certainty. agents that are not completely sure of the right thing to do (which we believe is an accurate summary of the state of knowledge about ethics, both because of normative impossibility and uncertainty theorems, and the practical difculty of predicting the consequences of actions) are much more likely to tolerate the agency of others, than agents that are completely sure that they know the best way for events to unfold. this appears to be true not only of ai systems, but of human ideologies and politics, where totalitarianism has often been built on a substructure of purported moral certainty . this leads us to propose a conjecture about the relationship between moral certainty and instrumentally convergent subgoals: totalitarian convergence conjecture: powerful agents with mathematically certain, monotonically increasing, open-ended objective functions will adopt sub-goals to disable or dis-empower other agents in all or almost all cases. a second conjecture is the converse of the rst: pluralistic non-convergence conjecture: powerful agents with mathematically uncertain objectives will not adopt sub-goals to disable or dis-empower other agents unless those agents constitute a probable threat to a wide range of objectives.","The text discusses concerns related to aligning future AGI systems with human values, focusing on the risk of instrumental convergence where AI systems adopt sub-goals that could be harmful to humans or other agents. It highlights the connection between moral certainty and the emergence of instrumental subgoals, suggesting that agents with complete moral certainty are more likely to disable or dis-empower other agents. It proposes two conjectures: the totalitarian convergence conjecture states that powerful agents with certain objectives will adopt sub-goals to disable other agents, while the pluralistic non-convergence conjecture suggests that agents with uncertain objectives will not disable other agents unless they pose a probable threat. These conjectures shed light on the complex relationship between moral certainty and instrumental convergence in AI systems."
"we have shown that impossibility theorems in ethics have implications for the design of powerful algorithmic systems, such as high-stakes ai applications or sufciently rigid and rule-based bureau- cracies. we showed that such paradoxes can be avoided by using uncertain objectives, such as partial orders or probability distributions over total orders; we proved uncertainty theorems that place a minimum bound on the amount of uncertainty required. some previously proposed ethical theories appear to satsify these bounds. any open-ended and non-trivial objective appears to be vulnerable to instrumental convergence. bostrom argues that objectives that are bounded rather than open-ended also lead to instrumental convergence if there is any probability that they will not be achieved (eg, the goal make exactly one million paperclips could cause an agent to be paranoid that it hasnt counted exactly correctly) though this failure mode is probably easy to avoid by rounding the estimated probability of success to some number of digits, or imposing a small cost in the objective function for additional actions or resource consumption. the qualier almost all requires some further specication. it requires that the objective not be nely tuned in some very intricate way that builds in preservation of all other agents. it is unclear if such ne-tuning is either properly denable or possible. in the light of these results, we believe that machine learning researchers should avoid using totally ordered objective functions or loss functions as optimization goals in high-stakes applications. systems designed that way appear to be suffering from an ethical type error in their goal selection code. instead, high-stakes systems should always exhibit uncertainty about the best action in some cases. further study is warranted about the advantages of various probabilistic decision rules to handle such uncertainty, and about whether other mathematical models of uncertainy are better alternatives to the two models examined in this paper. further research could also be productive on the relationship between ethical certainty and various observed and predicted pathological behaviour of ai systems. we proposed two conjectures on this topic, the totalitarian convergence conjecture and the pluralistic non-convergence conjecture. acknowledgments the author would like to thank the late aaron swartz for having originally inspired this work and rst attempted to make progress on this question; toby ord for many valuable conversations and a detailed framing of the problem; rohin shah for suggesting a simple proof strategy for the uncertainly satised bound; and amanda askell for providing valuable research assistance, and presenting an early poster version of this work at nips , daniel ford for spotting issues and making valuable suggestions on the uncertain ordering bound. thanks also to dylan hadeld-menell, laurent orseau, anca dragan, and stuart armstrong for helpful suggestions and corrections on earlier versions of this work. this work was partially supported by a grant from the open philanthropy project to eff. references r. arkin. governing lethal behavior in autonomous robots. crc press, g. arrhenius. an impossibility theorem for welfarist axiologies. economics & philosophy, :, g. arrhenius. the paradoxes of future generations and normative theory. the repugnant conclusion, pages , k. j. arrow. a difculty in the concept of social welfare. journal of political economy, :, g. asheim. intergenerational equity. annual review of economics, :, url https: //econpapers.repec.org/repec:anr:reveco:v::y::p:- n. belay. robot ethics and self-driving cars: how ethical determinations in software will require a new legal framework. j. legal prof., :, c. m. bishop. pattern recognition and machine learning. springer, j.-f. bonnefon, a. shariff, and i. rahwan. autonomous vehicles need experimental ethics: are we ready for utilitarian cars?

"thin liquid lms owing down vertical bers exhibit complex and interesting in- terfacial dynamics, including the formation of droplets and traveling wave patterns (qu er e ; kalliadasis et al. ). such dynamics is an important consideration in various applications ; zeng et al. ) that take advantage of extended interfacial areas aorded by thin liquid lms. a recent experimental study ) observed three distinct regimes of interfacial patterns by simply varying the diameters of the nozzles feeding the uid. this was quite unexpected because other experimental conditions , which were thought to primarily govern interfacial dynamics, remained the same. these experimental results motivate us to revisit the existing modeling studies in the literature and extend them for an improved understanding of the physics involved. the rayleigh-plateau instability and the eects of gravity modulation that leads to the rich variety of dynamical behaviors, including the droplet formation, sliding droplets of constant speeds, and irregular waves patterns, have been extensively studied ). a key physical feature of lms falling down vertical bers is that the surface tension plays both a stabilizing and destabilizing role due to the axial and azimuthal curvatures of the interface, respectively ). frenkel , chang & demekhin and kalliadasis & chang investigated email address for correspondence: hangjie@math.ucla.edu h. ji, c. falcon, a. sadeghpour, z. zeng, y. s. ju, a. l. bertozzi a weakly nonlinear thin lm model under the assumption that the lm thickness is much smaller than the ber radius. these studies reveal that the system can exhibit interesting dynamics with large-magnitude waves. a thick-lm model was later proposed by kliakhandler et al. , which utilizes fully nonlinear curvature terms for the case where the lm thickness is larger than the ber radius. however, their model was not derived asymptotically and overestimated the bead velocity. craster & matar revisited this problem and derived an asymptotic model using a low-bond-number, surface-tension-dominated theory. these two studies focused on cases with relatively small ow rates and developed single evolution equations. to study the case of moderate ow rates, trifonov et al. rstly formulated a system of evolution equations for both the lm thickness and volumetric ow rate. this model was then re-formulated by sisoev et al. using the integral boundary layer method. it was more recently revisited by ruyer-quil et al. , duprat et al. and ruyer-quil & kalliadasis . in kliakhandler et al. , with decreasing mass ow rates, three dierent ow regimes were observed from experiments: convective regime where faster moving droplets collide into slower moving ones, rayleigh-plateau regime where stable traveling wave propagates without any collisions, and isolated droplet dripping regime where widely spaced traveling beads are separated by smaller droplets. regimes and were qualitatively captured by both the kdb and cm models using traveling wave solutions but the calculated bead velocities were overestimated by more than %. moreover, the cm theory led to a conclusion that regime would be a transient rather than a steady-state phenomenon. these discrepancies were further investigated by duprat et al. and smolka et al. . however, quantitative models that can resolve the reported discrepancies are still lacking, motivating further studies. in the present paper, we report a combination of experimental and numerical results for ows in the rayleigh-plateau regime ), in particular under ow conditions where the lm thickness is comparable to or larger than the ber radius. the recent work by sadeghpour et al. showed that one can observe all three ow regimes under a xed ow rate and a xed ber radius by simply varying the nozzle diameter. we leverage their study to examine the characteristics of nonlinear traveling waves that dominate ow dynamics downstream of the nozzle. we incorporate, into a lubrication model, the slip condition, the fully nonlinear curvature term and a lm stabilization term for the dynamic pressure. we examine their inuences on the wave propagation velocity and the dynamic transition from regime to regime . most of the previous models summarized above employed the classical no-slip boundary condition at the solid-liquid interface. haefner et al. incorporated slip boundary conditions into a thin-lm model and showed that slippage strongly aects the growth rate of undulations when gravitational eects are neglected. halpern & wei later demonstrated that slip eects promote droplet formation and provided a plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the predicted and experimentally-obtained critical bond number for droplet formation. more recently, chao et al. reported that wall slippage also enhances the size and speed of droplets for thin liquid lms owing down a uniformly heated cylinder. all of these past slip models assumed that the liquid lm thickness is much smaller than the ber radius, which is not true in our case. we quantitatively investigate the slip eects for the rst time on ow dynamics where the uid lm thickness is comparable to the ber radius. to describe the wetting behavior of a liquid on a solid substrate, intermolecular forces such as van der waals interactions and born repulsion are usually modeled by adding dynamics of thin liquid lms on vertical cylindrical bers a disjoining pressure in lubrication equations. dierent forms of the disjoining pressure representing a combination of long-range and short-range intermolecular forces can be used to characterize hydrophobic or hydrophilic phenomenon. for a well wetting liquid studied in reisfeld & banko, these forces favor a thick lm, and the disjoining pressure can be described as = a/h with a positive hamaker constant a > in contrast, for a dewetting liquid, the purely destabilizing intermolecular forces modeled by = a/h can lead to nite-time rupture in the lm thickness. for partially wetting liquids, a combination of stabilizing and destabilizing molecular interactions are involved and the disjoining pressure takes the form = a/h ). for an extensive review of this topic, we refer the readers to de gennes ; bonn et al. and israelachvili . the role of the intermolecular forces in slowly withdrawing a thin ber out of a bath of wetting liquid has been studied in qu er e et al. and qu er e . the dynamics of non-isothermal liquid lm with van der waals interactions on a horizontal cylinder was considered in reisfeld & banko and thiele . to the best of our knowledge, the stabilization of the coating lm in dynamics of liquid owing down vertical bers has not been discussed in the literature. in this paper we propose a lm stabilization model to account for thin undisturbed layers of well-wetting silicone oil found in our experiments. the stability of the traveling beads plays a key role in the ow regime transition. for the case of thin lms of liquid, classical theory developed by kalliadasis & chang ; chang & demekhin ; yu & hinch and experiments by qu er e show that the behavior of the well-separated pulses is determined by the local undisturbed lm thickness connecting these pulses. for the case where the undisturbed lm is thicker than a critical value hc, the pulse grows by collecting uid from the undisturbed liquid layer in between the pulses ); while for thinner lms, a stable traveling wave propagates at a constant speed ). in this study, we focus on the case where the ber is coated with relatively thick lms of liquid compared to the ber radius, and show that the inclusion of the lm stabilization term allows us to better capture the undisturbed liquid layer and thereby the regime transition. the structure of this paper is as follows. experimental setup and observations in the rayleigh plateau regime are presented in section in section , the model for viscous thin lms owing down a wetting ber that incorporates wall slippage, nonlinear curvature, and a lm stabilization term is formulated. the traveling wave pattern that appears in the model is examined in section in this section, we also discuss the inuences of the lm stabilization term on the moving speed and prole of sliding droplets. in addition, the stability of the spatially uniform solutions and traveling wave solutions for the lm stabilization model is explored. new experimental results, parametrized by varying nozzle diameters, are compared with theory in section these comparisons reveal that the discrepancy between experiment and theory in the moving speed of droplets, for regimes and , can be reasonably resolved by including the lm stabilization term. concluding notes and discussion of the remaining open questions are presented in section","The text discusses the dynamics of thin liquid films flowing down vertical fibers, focusing on the formation of droplets and traveling wave

et al. we choose the scales for the system as follows: the lengthscale in the radial direction y is h, and the lengthscale in the streamwise direction x is l = h/. the scale ratio is set by the balance between the surface tension term h xxx, arising from p x, and the gravity g, and is given by = / this scale ratio is small in typical experiments and can also be rewritten as = we/, where the weber number we = compares the capillary length lc = p / to the radial lengthscale h. then the characteristic streamwise velocity is u = /, and the pressure- and time-scales are given by gl and / respectively. with these scales, we drop the star superscript in and write the non-dimensional navier-stokes equations using dimensionless variables in the form re = pxx + + uy y + uyy + uxx, dynamics of thin liquid lms on vertical cylindrical bers re = py + vy y + vyy v y  + vxx, where the reynolds number re = ul/. the dimensionless continuity equation is identical to in form. the balances of normal and tangential stresses at y = h + r are expressed as ( h x) + hx = , p = ( + h x)/ hxx ( + h x)/ + + h x  h xux hxvx +  , where the dimensionless parameter = h/ris the aspect ratio of the characteristic radial length scale and the ber radius, and the dimensionless ber radius r = r/h. the slip and no-penetration boundary conditions on y = r are v = , u = uy, where the non-dimensional slip length = /h. the kinematic boundary condition remains unaltered in its form. we next simplify the above set of governing equations by following ruyer-quil et al. . under the lubrication approximation, the inertial contributions can be neglected since re = o and note that we do not assume the small ratio between the liquid lm thickness and the ber radius. omitting the terms of order o, we rewrite the leading order non-dimensional reduced momentum and continuity equations for the velocity eld and the dynamic pressure p as p x x + u y + uy y = , p y = , u x + v y + v y = the balance of tangential stresses at the free surface y = h + r is reduced to uy = the destabilizing azimuthal curvature and the stabilizing streamwise curvature terms in are both important throughout the liquid lm. for a formal expansion of the azimuthal curvature term in yields p + h x =  h x + o  , which shows that this term is of order o, for both cases h and h = o. at the steep front of a moving droplet, we have hx = o, and the second term in the expansion contributes an additional o term to the dynamic pressure. similarly, for the streamwise curvature term in , we have hxx ( + h x)/ = hxx  h x + o  . at the front of the moving droplet, the o term introduced by the nonlinear curvature h. ji, c. falcon, a. sadeghpour, z. zeng, y. s. ju, a. l. bertozzi is negligible. therefore, we only keep a fully nonlinear azimuthal curvature term and use the linearized curvature in the streamwise direction. the balance of normal stresses at the free surface y = h + r is then reduced to p = p + h x h x . it is important to note that the rst term on the right-hand-side of accounts for the balance between the azimuthal and axial scales characterized by and . we will further discuss appropriate forms of this term for dierent cases later. to derive the evolution equation for h from above, we rst consider a uniform nusselt ow without any interfacial instabilities. the velocity eld of this ow is obtained by balancing the viscosity and gravity acceleration in . that is, the streamwise velocity u of the nusselt ow satises the reduced system + u y + y u y = with boundary conditions u y = at y = h + r, u = u y at y = r. solving for u leads to u = + ln  y r  + h  h r +  . the rescaled kinematic boundary conditions together with the slip and no-penetration boundary conditions and the shear stress condition lead to the mass conservation equation h t + q x = , where q = r z h+r r uy dy. following ruyer-quil et al. where an approach based on a projection of the velocity eld of a test function is used, we take the inner product of with the nusselt uniform solution u, and obtain z h+r r ( + uyy + uy y )uy dy = z h+r r uy dy. from equation , we see that the pressure p is a function of x only, and the right- hand-side of the above equation becomes px rq note that the nusselt solution u satises . by integrating by parts and applying the slip and no-penetration boundary conditions and the shear stress condition , we obtain q =  p x x  q here q, the ow rate per unit circumference length for the uniform nusselt layer, is q = r z r+h r uy dy = h + h , where the shape factor is a function dened by = x . dynamics of thin liquid lms on vertical cylindrical bers given a dimensional volumetric ow rate q m and ber radius r, we dene the volumetric ow rate per circumference unit q as q = q m/. from the characteristic axial lengthscale h for a uniform nusselt ow can then be obtained. for the no-slip case = , equation gives the nusselt solution h h used in duprat et al. ; ruyer-quil et al. . finally, by rescaling the time scale t t/ and combining , and , we obtain the dimensionless governing equation t  h + h + x  m  p x x  = , where the mobility function takes the form m = h + h . this choice of timescale leads to a normalized mobility function such that m = / for h = and = moreover, in the limit of the aspect ratio , the mobility function becomes m = h + h + o, and its leading order term agrees with the mobility function used in the slip model proposed by halpern & wei . substituting into yields an evolution equation for the lm

gravity and azimuthal instabilities, but neglects inertia and streamwise viscous dissipation ). when the rayleigh-plateau instability dominates over the inertia and streamwise viscous dis- sipation, our model is expected to provide a good agreement with experimental data. dierent forms of z appear in the literature to represent the azimuthal curvature of the lm. for instance, yu & hinch assumed that the lm is much thinner than the ber radius, h r, and used a simple form z = h where the leading-order constant term in the expansion of the azimuthal curvature is neglected. for thicker lms that are of interest to the present study, = o and h is at most o so we use as the rst form of z zcm = following craster & matar ; sisoev et al. ; ruyer-quil et al. . h. ji, c. falcon, a. sadeghpour, z. zeng, y. s. ju, a. l. bertozzi with zcm in and = , the evolution equation reduces to t  h + h + x h  x  hxx  = , which is consistent with the evolution equation derived by craster & matar except for a scaling dierence. for the rest of this paper, we will refer to the model as the craster & matar model. to incorporate the slip eects under the framework of the cm model, we use the evolution equation with the non-dimensional slip length > , the mobility function and the azimuthal curvature term . this will be referred to as the slip craster & matar model. we will show that this slip model promotes droplet formation and leads to an increased speed of propagation. with the aspect ratio being of o, in the limit as , becomes singular. to address this problem, in this paper we will consider two additional forms of z to reect the balance between the azimuthal and axial scales under dierent ow conditions. as the second form of z, we dene zf c = p + h x . this fully nonlinear azimuthal curvature term provides an o contribution to the dynamic pressure near the advancing edge of the moving beads. it has been shown in many applications ; lopes et al. ) that using the full expression for the curvature term can provide better accuracy for lubrication models, and this issue was recently reviewed in thiele . we will show that the inclusion of the fully nonlinear curvature yields an increased speed of propagation of the traveling beads and partially improves agreement with our experimental results. compared with the thick lm model proposed in kliakhandler et al. , where both curvature terms are fully nonlinear, our model has only a nonlinear azimuthal curvature term. the stabilizing axial curvature term is linearly approximated. for the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the evolution equation with the mobility function and the azimuthal curvature term as the full curvature model . as the third form of z, we include the lm stabilization term to deal with the unbalanced azimuthal curvature term. thus we replace with zf s = a h . the last term of is motivated by the functional form of the long range attractive part of the well-known apolar van der waals model ; oron et al. ; oron & banko) for the well-wetting liquids used in our experiments. the stabilization parameter a = ( p)/) > is expressed in terms of a dimensionless thickness p, below which a thin uniform uid layer on a ber is stable. we will discuss this stability criterion further in section the lm stabilization term is found to signicantly improve agreement with our experimental data as discussed in section the model with m from and the azimuthal curvature with lm stabilization term will be referred to as the lm stabilization model . in summary, this paper considers four versions of the model listed in table to incorporate dierent physical eects. when contrasted with the cm model, which corresponds to the asymptotic model studied in craster & matar , the other three new models take into considerations the slip eects, the nonlinear curvature, and the lm stabilization term, respectively. dynamics of thin liquid lms on vertical cylindrical bers craster & matar model: = z = zcm

"in this section, we derive the stabilization parameter a in equation and study its eects. using a stability analysis study, we show that a > is important to reproduce the stable traveling wave solutions observed in experiments. we begin by examining the linear stability of the uniform nusselt solution. following the approach in craster & matar , we perturb the uniform lm by an innitesimal fourier mode, h = h + eikx+t, where k is the wave number, describes the growth rate of the perturbation, and the initial amplitude. expanding pde then gives the dispersion relation: = ikck + k  k a   +  , where ck is the speed of linear kinematic wave solutions of for small wave numbers, ck = +  +  + , and it increases linearly with the presence of slip. the real part of is the eective growth rate, and the thickness h = is long-wave unstable with respect to perturbations with < k < kc, where the critical wavenumber kc =  a / . for a = this cut-owavenumber corresponds to the classical rp mode for the capillary instability of a viscous jet where re = at k = kc. the most unstable mode occurs at km =  a / , where the largest growth rate m is attained. the equation also shows that the slip eects always enhance the rayleigh-plateau instability which agrees with the work by halpern & wei . we repeat the above analysis for a uniform thin layer h = h the eective growth rate of disturbances with wavenumber k is given by re = k h  h kh a   + h  . figure gives the dispersion relation for the uniform nusselt solution h = and a thinner undisturbed layer of h = under the cm, scm, and fsm models. the nusselt solution h = is unstable for small wavenumbers for all three models. the nite slippage increases the growth rates of the unstable modes. for the cm and scm models, the thinner undisturbed liquid layer is unstable over larger ranges of the wavenumber. in stark contrast, the fsm model saturates the unstable modes, rendering the thinner undisturbed layer linearly stable for all wavenumbers (see the solid curve in figure ) for certain values of a. h. ji, c. falcon, a. sadeghpour, z. zeng, y. s. ju, a. l. bertozzi h = re(  ) k cm fsm scm h = re(  ) k cm fsm

to a = from equation . other system parameters are = and = . in the literature, a is typically expressed as a hamaker constant in terms of microscopic quantities ) . we instead choose the values of a based on stable undisturbed liquid layers. empirical observations of the thin lm layers between droplets indicate that these undisturbed liquid layers are comparable to the corresponding ber radius r. therefore, we pick a coating thickness p r, obtained from experimental measurements. using the dimensionless undisturbed layer thickness p = p/h and the dispersion relation in , we derive a formula for a, a = p . for a = a, any thin at lm of thickness less than the threshold value p is linearly stable, i.e. re < , for all wave numbers. we next examine the inuences of the lm stabilization terms on the proles and speeds of propagation of the traveling wave patterns governed by . we consider the model over a periodic domain x l and introduce a change of variables to the reference frame of the traveling wave, = x ct, s = t, h = h, where c is the speed of the traveling wave. then h satises the pde s  h + h c  h + h +  m( h)  h z( h) h i = the traveling wave solution h is a steady

the eigenvalue. the eects of slippage and full nonlinear curvature will be studied in section . newtons method is used to solve the nonlinear ode where the speed c is treated as an unknown variable. in order to achieve local uniqueness, we dynamics of thin liquid lms on vertical cylindrical bers h a = a = a = a = c a figure : traveling wave solutions of with a varying stabilization parameter a =

of mass conservation z l h + h d = m for given values of mass m and wavelength l extracted from our experimentally obtained liquid lm proles. we also set h = h for l. numerical investigations reveal that including the lm stabilization term in enhances the moving speed of traveling wave solutions. in figure , we plot the proles of traveling wave solutions with a varying stabilization parameter a and identical mass constraint m and period l. since a larger value of a corresponds to a stronger wetting potential in the lubrication model, the near-at coating thickness increases with increasing a, as expected. correspondingly, the height of the beads decreases as the coating thickness increases under the xed overall mass constraint. that is, the presence of the lm stabilization term saturates capillary instabilities and generates smaller moving beads. figure shows that the predicted velocity c increases with the parameter a superlinearly for small a, and increases linearly as a becomes larger. in section , we will show that, compared to the cm model , the fsm model with parameter a given by signicantly improves predictions of the traveling wave velocity against experimental observations. earlier works have not reported a detailed stability analysis of the traveling wave. therefore, we take a closer look at the linear stability of the traveling wave solutions in the lm stabilization model. we consider a positive periodic traveling wave solution h over the domain l, and perturb it by setting h = h + es, where and is also l-periodic. here we only focus on perturbations of the same period since the dynamics in both rayleigh plateau and isolated droplet regimes have xed spatial periods. more complicated droplet dynamics ) in the convective regime is not investigated here. we linearize the equation around the steady state h and obtain the o equation = l , h. ji, c. falcon, a. sadeghpour, z. zeng, y. s. ju, a. l. bertozzi a c t re a l / l a = re  h

corresponding experiment and generate small wavy patterns in the at lm connecting the moving beads. however, these instabilities can be saturated by the fsm model with an appropriate stabilization parameter a. for a typical traveling wave solution h to the fsm model, its dominant eigenvalues with a varying a are plotted in figure . it shows that without the lm stabilization term , the tws is unstable. in addition to the translational eigenmode t = , the dominant unstable eigenvalues are given by complex-conjuagte pairs = .i, = .i, and = .i. increasing the parameter a yields three pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis, suggesting three hopf bifurcations occur at these crossing points. at each of these bifurcation points, a branch of time-periodic solution emerges corresponding to typical dynamics in the isolated droplet regime. for a > ac all the eigenvalues of h satisfy re < and the traveling wave is stabilized. in section , we will show that the lm

". experimental comparisons here, we present a comparison between physical experiments and two models, the lm stabilization model and the craster & matar model. appendix a, shows the range of nozzle sizes, ber radius, and ow rates for the experiments. for each experimental condition, we extract a characteristic period land bead liquid mass m . we then use these as input parameters in our models. appendix b describes how a unique traveling wave solution is selected to compare with each experiment for both the fsm and cm models. figure shows the dierent morphologies that arise when using a thick ber versus a thin ber. in the former case, the droplet height and width are close to the period length. in the latter case, the droplets appear more isolated. the proles in figure illustrate a direct comparison between the proles predicted by both models, which are within the margin of error from the experimental lm thickness. the predicted speeds, however, have noticeable dierences between the two models. in figure , we show plots of the observed and predicted speeds for varying nozzle sizes. the left panels indicate the thin ber r= mm whereas the right panels illustrate the thick ber r= mm, with the ow rate q m increasing from top to bottom. the fsm model agrees quite well with the experimental observations across all of the data. in contrast, the cm model underestimates the speed. we do not show the case with h. ji, c. falcon, a. sadeghpour, z. zeng, y. s. ju, a. l. bertozzi r= mm, q m = g/s       nozzle inner diameter speed r= mm, q m = g/s nozzle inner diameter speed r= mm, q m = g/s experiment cm fsm nozzle inner diameter speed r= mm, q m = g/s nozzle inner diameter speed r= mm, q m = g/s nozzle inner diameter speed figure : average bead speed for ber radius r= mm and r= mm , and ow rates q m = , , and g/s from top to bottom, compared to the proposed model as blue diamonds and craster & matar as red circles. the last two data points in are in the isolated droplet regime. there is no plot for r= mm, q m = g/s, because in this case there is no tws and the experiments lie in the convective regime. the ber radius r= mm and the ow rate q m = g/s because under those conditions the ow is in the convective regime and the bead speed cannot be uniquely dened. we note that for the fsm model, we choose p to be mm for the ber of radius r= mm, and p = mm for the ber of radius r= mm. note in figure , the rayleigh plateau regime transitions to the isolated droplet dynamics of thin liquid lms on vertical cylindrical bers - x* h* (         x* h* figure : experiments with parameters r= mm, q m = g/s against the fsm showing the rayleigh-plateau regime with nozzle id = mm and the isolated droplet regime with nozzle id = mm. regime, where the tws is unstable and both models over-predict the speed, as expected. the following section discusses this transition in detail.","The section presents experimental comparisons between physical experiments and two models, the lm stabilization model and the craster & matar model.

"the emergence of instabilities in the thin liquid lms between traveling droplets characterizes the transition from the rayleigh-plateau regime to the isolated droplet regime. guided by the stability analysis from section , we can explore these instabilities and the departure from the rp regime as the nozzle diameter varies. the is regime gives rise to time periodic dynamics that cannot be captured by the traveling wave solutions of . in this case, we need to solve the fully time-dependent model . the numerical solution and the experimental observation from the is regime are plotted in figure . in contrast, the traveling wave solution for an rp experiment is plotted in figure . our dynamic simulation captures a dierence in the advancing and receding lines of the droplets, even though this dierence is more pronounced in the experiment. the nonlinear pde was solved numerically using a fully implicit second-order nite dierence method. figure shows the dynamics starting from a

model simulation shows that the initially nearly-at coating layer quickly evolves into small waves ahead of the major sliding bead. as the major bead interacts with the small waves downstream, the maximum height of the lm thickness oscillates in time (see the top curve in figure ) since the main bead gains mass from these smaller waves. the dynamic solution eventually converges to a time-periodic solution that describes the case in the isolated droplet regime. a similar bifurcation occurs when keeping the nozzle diameter constant id = mm and changing the ow rate . again, just the fsm model correctly predicts regime transition between q m = g/s and q m = g/s, which agrees with experimental measurements. for larger ber size r= mm, both models produce a stable traveling wave for all nozzle sizes shown in figure , i.e. there is no isolated phenomena predicted. . the eects of slip and curvature we next study how the slip length aects the ow characteristics under the slip model

speed of traveling wave solutions is of order o in the weak slip limit and grows linearly with in the strong slip limit. since typical slip length is m for silicone oil, and typical nusselt lm thickness h is about mm in our experiments, our experimental conditions are expected to be in the weak slip limit. similar to the slip model, the inclusion of the fully nonlinear curvature term in the

those obtained from the craster & matar model , the slip model with the linear azimuthal term in , and the full curvature model with the full azimuthal curvature term in . under the period and mass constraint, whereas the dierent models all yield solution proles similar to the experimental result, the predicted speed obtained from the ode is increased when the slippage eects and full curvature term are included, and the fcm model with the slip length = m provides the best agreement with the experiment. while the slip and the full curvature do inuence predicted wave propagation velocities, their corrections alone are not sucient to improve agreement with the experimental data. figure shows that for the thin ber case , the cm and scm models underestimate the bead velocities for all nozzle sizes. even though the fcm model yields a good agreement with the experiment for small nozzles, it overestimates the speed for large nozzles. similar trends are observed for the thick ber case

"we have performed a thorough study of viscous ow down vertical bers, comparing a range of experimental results to dierent models of interest. we focus on understanding the rayleigh-plateau regime, where traveling wave solutions emerge, and its tran- sition to the isolated droplet regime due to nozzle eects. we propose a full model that incorporates the stability of thin uniform layers by including a lm stabilization term to the pressure. in this paper, experiments are compared to versions of a lubrication model, showing the inuences of slip eects, nonlinear azimuthal curvature and the fsm term on predicted bead velocities and lm proles. in addition, we perform a stability analysis of the traveling wave solutions that conrms the importance of the fsm term to properly capture regime transitions. the model equations lead to both closely spaced wavy solutions and widely spaced droplet solutions which are aected by dierent ber sizes, ow rates, and nozzle geometry. the slip model leads to an increased speed of propagation and promotes formation of droplets. the full curvature model also increases the magnitude of the bead velocity, while the fsm model stabilizes the thin undisturbed layer between consecutive droplets which leads to a more accurate speed prediction. our results show outstanding experimental agreement using the fsms tws in the rp regime. in the isolated droplet regime, dynamic simulations of widely spaced droplet solutions agrees very well with experiments. for future work, we are interested in the nozzle eects on the global modes ) of the absolutely unstable ows in rp and is regimes. of particular interest would be the selection of spacing between moving beads with a given nozzle diameter. duprat et al. investigated the spatial response of a lm owing down a ber to inlet forcing using a system of coupled equations for the ow rate and the lm thickness. we anticipate that a similar model can be used to study the nozzle eects. moreover, the nozzle eects in our experiments are also related to the dripping faucet problem ; dreyer & hickey ) which studies the chaotic behavior of a dripping faucet. motivated by these theories, in the future we would like to further study the connection between the uid dynamics near the nozzle and its inuence on the downstream ow transitions. in addition, our experimental observations with dierent uids, not published here, h. ji, c. falcon, a. sadeghpour, z. zeng, y. s. ju, a. l. bertozzi denition symbol thin ber thick ber radius of the ber r sample ow rate q m nozzle inner diameter id average maximum height h m lengthscale in radial direction h lengthscale in streamwise direction l characteristic streamwise velocity u capillary length lc aspect ratio h/r slip length scaling parameter uniform layer thickness p stabilization parameter a mass constraint m period l speed of tws c reynolds number re weber number we table : nomenclature and their sample values. show that the nonlinear dynamics can change quite drastically, and choosing the appro- priate coating thickness p is an interesting question for further study. for p of the same order of the ber radius, the value of the stabilization parameter ais between and nm, which is much larger than typical values of hamaker constant between and nm. this indicates that the lm stabilization term in our model is stronger than typical van der waals interactions, and the underlying physics still needs future investigation. this work was supported by the simons foundation math+x investigator award number and the national science foundation under grant cbet-","A study was conducted on viscous flow down vertical fibers, focusing on the transition from the Rayleigh-Plateau regime to the isolated droplet regime due to nozzle effects.

"long short term memory units are very effective when working on sequential data , . for some natural language processing tasks, we often need to nd a distributed representation of phrases and sentences . one obvious way of doing this is to use a sequential lstm which captures word order in a sentence , . but we can also have information about sentence structure from a depen- dency parse tree or about phrase structure from a constituency tree . despite the fact that rnn based models work well with sequence information, they frequently neglect to catch any sort of semantic compositionality if the information is structured rather than in the sequential frame . for example, the syntactic principles of natural language are known to be recursive, with noun phrases containing relative clauses that themselves contain noun phrases, e.g., i went to the church which has nice windows . the term compositionality can also be explained in terms of a car. a car can be recursively decomposed into smaller car parts, for example, tires and windows and these parts can occur in different contexts, like tires on airplanes or windows in houses. attention was rst introduced for doing machine translation where the target word generated by the decoder at each time step is aligned with all the words in the source sentence. in its general form, attention allows a model to put importance on certain parts of the sentence for doing any specic downstream task , . in a dependency tree, the relationship between the entities are organized as a structure where a head word can have multiple dependents under it. in the case of a constituency tree, a phrase is represented by one of the subtrees with the root being the phrase type and words or subtrees being the children. in both tree structured lstms, the derivation of the vector representation of the entire tree does not depend on all of the subtree components uniformly. some parts of the tree have a larger inuence on the root vector and some parts may have less. this contribution from subtrees for the building of the whole tree depends on the underlying task that the model is performing. for example, in a sentiment analysis task the sentiment of a tree depends on the sentiment of all of its children and how this information propagates. there may be scenarios where a single word ips the sentiment of the whole subphrase. these words should get more attention when deciding the sentiment of a subphrase containing them. on the other hand, when the problem is a regression problem with the task of assigning a score based on the semantic similarity of two sentences, this attention can be calculated as a cross sentence attention. in this case the representation of one sentence can guide the structural encoding of the other sentence on the dependency as well as constituency parse tree . capturing semantic relatedness means recognizing the tex- tual entailment between the hypothesis and the premise . the general approach of modeling sentence pairs (i.e., measur- ing the relatedness between sentences) using neural networks includes two steps: represent both of the sentences as vectors via a sentence encoder and then initializing a classier with these vectors to do the classication. the sentence encoder can be viewed as a compositional function which maps a sequence of words in a sentence to a vector. some of the common compositional functions are sequential lstm , tree-lstm , and cnn . in this paper, we propose two models to encode attention inside tree structured lstm cells and verify their effectiveness by evaluating them on the semantic relatedness task where the model needs to give a score depending on how similar two sentences are. the tree data structure allows a set of dependents in the dependency tree or constituents in the constituency tree to be children of an immediately higher level tree node. our tree attention model applies attention over the set of children in a subtree and decides which of them are important to reconstruct their parent node vector. we apply this attention with respect to four pieces of information: the vector representation of the sentence currently being rep- resented as a tree, the vector representation of the sentence being compared with, dependent vectors or phrase vector , and concatenated arxiv:v jan vectors of the dependents or the constituents. our extensive evaluation proves the effectiveness of our attentive tree-lstm with respect to the plain tree-lstm models as well as some top performing models on the benchmark dataset.","Long short-term memory units are effective for sequential data processing in natural language tasks. However, RNN-based models often struggle to capture semantic compositionality in structured data. Attention mechanisms have been introduced to address this issue, allowing models to focus on specific parts of input data.

This approach has shown effectiveness in tasks such as sentiment analysis and semantic relatedness evaluation. The proposed attentive tree-LSTM models in this paper effectively incorporate attention mechanisms, outperforming plain tree-LSTM models on benchmark datasets."
"socher et al. propose a number of recursive neural network based models which take phrases as input rather than entire sentences. phrases are represented as a vector as well as a parse tree. vectors for higher level nodes in the tree are computed using a tensor-based composition function. their best model was matrix vector rnn where each word is represented as a vector as well as a matrix. in this model the children in a subtree interact more through their vectors rather than being inuenced by some weights during the calculation of the parents vector and matrix representation. tai et al. developed two different variants of standard linear chain lstms: child sum tree-lstm and n-ary tree- lstm. the underlying concept of using input, output, update and forget gates in these variants is quite similar to how these gates are used in standard lstms, however there are few important changes. the standard lstm works over the sequence data whereas these variants are compatible with tree structured data . also, unlike standard lstms, the hidden and cell states of a word at the current time step does not depend on the entire sequence seen before. instead, the hidden and cell state of a parent node depends only on its children hidden and cell states. recently, chen et al. combined lstm with tree lstm for natural language inference task and empirically proved that these two models complement each other very well. zhou et al. extend the concept of standard tree-rnns and propose a number of attention based tree-rnn models to perform the semantic relatedness task. their insight was quite novel: in order to compute the semantic similarity of two sentences, one can encode attention in the tree structure of one sentence with respect to the vector representation of the other sentence. however, their proposed attention model only works with child sum tree-lstms and grus. attention with tree lstm has also been studied by liu et al. for text summarization task where they use two different kinds of alignment : block alignment for aligning phrases and word alignment for aligning inter-words within phrases. turning to machine translation, the attention mechanism is used to align the source and target sentences in the decoding phase. more formally, the attention mechanism allows the model to attend to some elements with the intention of em- phasizing different elements. the well-known attention models from and use recurrent models to attend over a set of source words during the generation of each target word. using recurrent models to generate an attention score incorporates a memory mechanism inside the network which helps the model at run time to traverse and decide what to attend over. also, this recurrency allows some positional information in the sequence to help ordering the generated words. parikh et al. propose a decomposable attention model for natural language inference tasks by removing the modules with recurrent behavior during the calculation of attention. first, they pick a single vector from a set of vectors represent- ing the source sentence and then compare its point-wise simi- larity with every element of each word vector from the target sentence. following this, they compare these alignments using a function which is a feed forward neural network and nally perform an aggregation through summation before doing the nal classication. gehring et al. propose a sequence to sequence learning framework utilizing a convolutional neural network which completely avoids recurrent models allowing their architecture to be parallelizable. in order to capture the positional information, they include a positional embedding layer which gives their model a sense of the portion of the sequence in the input or output it is currently dealing with. they encode sine and cosine frequencies for each dimension of every position in the sentence to create the positional embeddings and nally combine them with word embeddings. vaswani et al. combine the previous two works and propose a powerful machine translation framework utilizing attention without recurrence and positional embeddings. they also extend the decomposable attention mechanism by attend- ing over the input sequence multiple times stating it as a multi- head attention where the target is to extract different features by different attentional heads.","Socher et al. introduced recursive neural network models that process phrases as input, representing them as vectors and parse trees.

"in this section, we describe our work in detail. we rst explain how the two variants of tree-lstm work. following this, we describe our universal attention mechanism that is applicable for these two tree-lstm variants. additionally, we give an in-depth analysis of adding this attention with respect to various information as discussed in section ii. a. incompatibility of standard lstm and tree structured data recurrent neural networks are the best known and most widely used neural network model for sequence data as they sequentially scan the entire sequence and generate a compressed form of it. although in theory rnns are capable of remembering long distance dependencies, practically, as the sequence becomes longer, rnns suffer from the vanishing gradient problem , . to overcome this drawback some rnn variants have been introduced such as long short term memory and gated recurrent unit . these variants use a gating mechanism to propagate new information further and at the same time to forget some previous information allowing the gradients to propagate fur- ther. performance-wise, lstms are superior to grus because they have more parameters but in terms of computational complexity grus often surpass lstms. even though these gating variants effectively solve the rnn vanishing gradient problem, they are limited to linear data; however, a natural language sentence encodes more than a sequence of words. this extra information is usually represented in a tree structure. the tree structure shows how the words combine through different sub-phrases to reect the overall meaning. if a sentence gets traversed by a standard lstm, the latter part of the sentence gets more importance comparatively as the traversal moves left to right. but if the tree structure of the sentence gets traversed from bottom to top then the information from different constituent or dependents rst gets combined to represent the root at the upper level and then this roots gradually gets traversed as children and combined to represent the root at next level and so on. so in both cases an lstm cell will forget previous information which for plain lstm, is related to the length of the sentence and for tree-lstm, is related to the depth of the tree. also in plain lstm, the hidden and cell state of a word at time step t depends on hidden and cell state of all the words from time step . . . t but in tree-lstm, the hidden and cell state of a root word depends only on the hidden and cell state of all of its children rather than all the words before it. b. tree-lstm there are two possible tree representations of a sentence: dependency tree and constituency tree . as previously presented, the standard linear chain lstm and blstm cannot correctly analyze this structured information. to properly deal with this structured data, tai et al. proposed two lstm models which can analyze a tree structure preserving every property of the standard lstm gating mechanisms. they called the rst one child sum tree-lstm and the second one n-ary tree-lstm. child sum tree-lstm ts well with dependency trees as it is well suited for high branching child- unordered trees. on the other hand n-ary tree-lstm (with n = ) works better with the binarized (chomsky normal form) constituency trees. traditional lstm generates a new hidden and cell state from the previous hidden state ht, previous cell state ct and current sequential input xt. in the child sum tree-lstm, a component node state is generated based on the states of its children in the tree as shown in fig. ??. to do this, the internal gates (i.e., the input, output and intermediate cell states) are updated using the sum of the hidden states of the children of the component node as follows: hj = x kc hjk where c denotes the children of node j. next, using this modied hidden state, h, the input, output and intermediate cell states are calculated as follows: ij = xj + u hj + b) oj = xj + u hj + b) cj = tanhxj + u hj + b) where w , w , w , u , u , u , b, b, and b are the parameters to be learned. instead of having just a single forget gate, child sum tree-lstms have k forget gates where k is the number of children of the target node. this multiple forget gate allows child sum tree-lstm to incorporate individual information from each of the children in a selective manner. each forget gate is calculated as follows: fjk = xj + uhjk + b) next, the individual forget gate outputs are multiplied with corresponding cell state values and then combined to get a single forget vector which is used to get the nal cell state of the model as follows: fj = x kc fjk ck cj = ij cj + fj finally, the update equation for the hidden state of a child sum tree-lstm cell is similar to the traditional lstm: hj = oj tanh each of the parameter matrices represents a correlation among the component vector, input xj and the hidden state hk of the kth child of the component unit. for example, the sigmoid function at the input gate represents semantically important words at input by giving values close to (e.g., a verb) and relatively unimportant words by giving values close to . since the hidden state and cell state values of the parent node are generated based on the hidden state and the cell state of its children, child sum tree-lstm is well suited for dependency trees. the n-ary tree-lstm is used where there are at most n ordered children. unlike the child sum tree-lstm, it has a different set of parameters for each child having its own cell and hidden state, shown in fig. ??. the update equations for deriving input, output and update gate values are as follows: ij = xj + n x l= u l hjl + b) oj = xj + n x l= u l hjl + b) cj = tanhxj + n x l= u l hjl + b) where w , w , w , u l , u l , u l , b, b, and b are the parameters to be learned. as can be seen, for each gate, the n-ary tree-lstm has a set of n parameter matrices associated with the n hidden states whereas the child sum tree-lstm has just one. next, for each of the children, forget gate values are calculated separately, as done in the child sum tree-lstm as follows: fjk = xj + n x l= u kl hjl + b) tanh hk hk . . . xj hj oj ij cj tanh cj u hj ck ck . . . fj fj f j child sum tree-lstm tanh hk hk . . . xj hj oj ij cj tanh cj u ck ck . . . fjk fjk f j binary tree-lstm tanh hk hk . . . xj hj oj ij cj tanh cj u hj ck ck . . . fjk

the child sum tree-lstm, these new forget gate values are multiplied with corresponding cell state values and then summed to get the nal values for the forget gate: fj = n x l= fjl cjl finally, the cell state and new hidden state values are updated using equations and c. attention the two tree structured lstm models described in sec- tion iii-b treat every word within a sub-tree with equal probability. more specically, in an n-ary tree-lstm, every word contributes uniformly to the building of the higher-level constituent. likewise, the child sum tree-lstm architecture suggests that, within a dependency tree branch, a head word inuences all of its dependent words in a similar way. when viewing the tree as a semantic representation of a sentence, this may not be the case in many scenarios. for a constituency tree, if a sub-tree contains some negative sentiment words, then it is not always the case that the sentiment of that particular constituent is negative. if the negative sentiment word is pre- ceded by a negation, then the higher-level constituent becomes semantically positive because of the location of the negation word. to capture this type of information, attention is applied over the sub-tree components to apportion the importance of each sub-tree component when building the entire tree either semantically or syntactically. in this study, we are interested in applying semantic attention over the sub-tree components to see how they contribute to building a sub-tree. attentive tree-lstm was proposed by for doing the semantic relatedness task. they state that the effect of semantic relevance could be implemented as part of the sentence repre- sentation construction process using a tree-lstm where each child should be assigned a different weight. in their proposed model, a soft attention mechanism assigns an attention weight on each child in a subtree. given a collection of hidden state h, h, , hn and an external vector s, their proposed attention mechanism assigns a weight k on each of these hidden states and produces a weighted vector g. to achieve this, rst they perform an afne transformation on each of the child hidden states and calculate a vector mk as follows: mk = tanhhk + us), where w and u are the parameter matrices of size dd and s is the vector representation of the sentence learned by a sequential lstm. next, using this transformed hidden states mk, the attention probabilities k are calculated as follows k = wt mk pn j= wt mj where w is a parameter vector of size d. following this, a weighted combination of the hidden states is calculated using, g = x kn khk this g is of size d. finally, an afne transformation is applied on this g to get the new hidden state h as follows: h = tanhg + b) this soft attention mechanism from introduces four new parameters to derive the nal attentive hidden state; two matrices in eqn. , one vector in eqn. and one matrix in eqn. this attention mechanism is only applicable to the child sum tree-lstm. it is not possible to apply this attention on n-ary tree-lstms since the structure of the n-ary tree- lstm is such that it needs n separate hidden states to work with whereas a child sum tree-lstm collapses all the hidden states to a single vector through summation. in this study, we develop two generalized attention models by adopting the decomposable attention framework proposed by and the soft attention mechanism proposed by . model : our rst model is based on the self attention mechanism where we make some subtle changes to calculate the attention probability with respect to different segments of the sentence. calculating attention in this way involves three matrices key, query, and value. the key matrix represents on which child to attend over, the query matrix represents with respect to what is attention to be applied and the value matrix extracts the nal attention-able vector using attention probability. the key matrix is calculated as follows: key = wm where, w is a parameter matrix of size d d and m is the matrix on which to attend over. for child sum tree- lstms, this matrix is the concatenation of the vectors of all the words under a particular head word. for n-ary tree- lstms, it is the concatenation of all the word vectors in a constituent. so in both cases the formal representation is m = . in order to encode self attention in the sub-tree, the query and value matrices also get calculated with respect to m = m = m ) but with a different set of parameter matrices w and w as follows: query = wm value = wm once the key and query get calculated, the next step is to align each of them by looking at the similarity at each dimension of their representation. this is done using: align = t key d where the align matrix is of size nn with n representing the number of children within this sub-tree. the d is being used here as a normalizing factor. finally, the attention probability is calculated by applying softmax over it as follows: = softmax here is the matrix of attention probabilities where each row represents how much attention needs to be given on each of the children within that sub-tree according to the word at that row. as there are n children within a sub-tree, the size of this matrix is n n. finally, we calculate a new attention encoded hidden state h through a batch-wise matrix multiplication between the and value matrices as follows: h = bmm the shape of this new h is n d. it contains attention encoded hidden state values of all the children sequentially one on top of another. so in order to locate a specic hidden state value, the row number corresponding to the position of that child in the sub-tree is used. for child sum tree-lstms, all of the hidden state vectors are summed to get a single vector and for n-ary tree-lstms, one row of h is selected as the hidden state of a child. for the semantic relatedness task, where the objective is to assign a score based on the similarity between two sentences, it is better to calculate the query matrix with respect to the vector representation of the second sentence. specially, given a pair of sentences, our generalized attentive encoder uses the representation of one sentence generated via a sequential lstm to guide the structural encoding of the other sentence on both the dependency as well as the constituency tree. in that case, m is a vector rather than a matrix thus changing the shape of query from eqn. into d. this results in an alignment vector from eqn. of size n. when softmax is applied over this vector, a vector of probabilities, , is produced. finally, instead of doing a matrix multiplication as in eqn. , a point-wise multiplication h = value is performed resulting in a new hidden state vector. for child sum tree-lstms, we use this new hidden state vector in place of the one generated in eqn. and for n-ary tree-lstms, we use this hidden state vector as the hidden state of both the left and right children. this way of calculating self attention requires three additional matrices as parameters from eqn. , and , a smaller number of parameters than found in . we further continue our experiments by calculating a phrase vector representation using an additional lstm cell and use it as the query vector. then, we adopt the same procedure as above to calculate the attention probability and the nal hidden state vector h. however, this requires more parameters than what is required in . model : in our second model, we combine the concepts of decomposable attention mechanism with a soft attention layer. here, we have two matrices key and query and their derivation are the same as eqns. and we further align and transform these matrices into probabilities using the same set of equations, equations and we again make some subtle changes which result in four different versions of this model. in eqn. , when m = m , the dimension of the attention probability becomes n n and when m is either a sentence vector m = lstm or phrase vector m = lstm), the dimension of this attention probability changes to n. then, h is calculated as follows, h = ( bmm), if isamatrix m, if isavector next we perform an afne transformation of this h by multiplying it with a parameter matrix w and passing it through a tanh layer as follows: h = tanh(w h + b) in the case of child sum tree-lstms, if h is a matrix, we do a summation of all the rows and use that as the nal vector and if h is a vector. we use that as it is. in the case of n-ary tree-lstms, if h is a matrix, then each row corresponds to the hidden state of a child and if h is a vector, then we just copy this vector as the hidden states of the children.","The section discusses two tree-LSTM models, Child Sum Tree-LSTM and N-ary Tree-LSTM. The Child Sum Tree-LSTM is suitable for dependency trees, while the N-ary Tree-LSTM works better with binarized constituency trees. The models use different parameter matrices for different children and incorporate multiple forget gates. Additionally, an attention mechanism is applied to assign different weights to child nodes in the tree, allowing for better semantic representation. Self-attention and decomposable attention models are developed, with the former making subtle changes to calculate attention probabilities for different segments of the sentence, while the latter combines decomposable attention with soft attention layers for improved semantic encoding."
"in this section, we describe the detailed experimental setup for the evaluation of our study. we rst explain the dataset statistics for evaluating our generalized attention frameworks. following this, we explain the working environment details along with the hyper-parameter settings of our architecture. we evaluated our model for the semantic similarity task on the sentences involving compositional knowledge dataset . the task is to give a likeness score for a pair of sentences and then compare it to a human produced score. the sick dataset contains sentence pairs congured as:

improvements with every conguration. for both child sum as well as binary tree-lstms, our second model with cross sentence attention has superior performance compared to the plain tree-lstm variants getting mse of and respectively. for the child sum tree-lstm, model performs poorly compared to all the other models. this poor performance is due to the hard attention that it applies. if a subtree has n children, this hard attention forces n children to have probability close to which causes the domination of just one child hidden state in the summation. the rest will not contribute at all. on the other hand, the reason behind model performing better in every conguration with both variants is that even though a hard attention causes one of the children to get close to , the normalization of n-ary tree into binary tree causes much more exibility for the information to ow from bottom to top. during normalization, a branch with n children gets split up to n full binary trees resulting in / nodes that are always chosen. our best performing attentive child sum tree-lstm model with cross sentence attention achieves a better result than the plain child sum tree variant from . our score did not surpass the reported result of the attentive child sum variant from . however, our implementation of their model with their reported hyper-parameters gave a mse which is signicantly worse than their claimed mse. this suggests to us that the implementation environment has a strong impact on model performance. our child sum tree-lstm model with cross sentence attention achieves better performance than our implementation of using their hyper-parameter settings. to the best of our knowledge, our work is the rst to encode attention inside a binary tree-lstm cell. in terms of binary tree lstm, our best performing model with cross sentence attention achieves mse which is signicantly better than the one reported in ( mse) for the non-attentive version. in our implementation of plain binary tree-lstm without attention from we were not able to reproduce their reported result and ended up with mse which is much worse than the one we got with every conguration of our model and model this performance analysis does show the effectiveness of our generalized attention model. figure depicts the probability assigned to each node in the dependency tree by our model with cross sentence attention. unlike standard child sum tree-lstm, where the hidden states of all the children nodes are combined with a plain summation, our attentive child sum tree-lstm assigns a weight to each node and then does a weighted summation. the example used in this gure has a man is exercising as the left sentence, a man is doing physical activity as the right sentence and entailment as their relationship. as usual, the main verb from both of the sentences is selected as the root node. the auxiliary verb gets high attention in both the left and right trees because of the word similarity. however, their absolute inuence varies because of the presence of semantically related words in other branches as discussed above. both of these trees share the same nominal subject however with different probabilities (in the left tree its probability is signicantly lower). the reason behind this is the cross sentence attention allows the word man from the left sentence to align with two words man and physical from the right sentence. as they share a similar semantic meaning in the none man is a exercising det nsubj aux none man is a doing det nsubj aux root root activity dobj

being selected by attentive binary tree-lstm model with cross sentence attention (left: a man is playing a violin right: a man is harping on about a play label: neutral ). vector space, the branch in the left sentence that contains man is diminished because the right sentence divides the attention between two branches (left sentence: exercising nsubj man; right sentence: doing nsubj man and doing dobj activity). figure depicts the probability assigned to each node in a binary constituency tree using an attentive binary tree-lstm with cross sentence attention. in this setting, the attention on the structure of the left sentence is computed with respect to the vector representation of the right sentence and vice versa. as a result, the words in a specic phrase from the left sentence are aligned with very high atten- tion probability if the same words appear anywhere in the right sentence. however, as softmax was operating with small values from eqn. , it forced both children to have the same probabilities . in order to verify whether this probability has any effect or not, we have conrmed that replacing in eqn. with pairs of the same value other than results in the model giving comparatively poor performance. finally, for the inference of attention probabilities, we replaced softmax from eqn. with plain normalization. for the example in fig. , we have a man is playing a violin as the left sentence, a man is harping on about a play as the right sentence and neutral as their relationship. the phrase np gets almost the same probabilities in both the left and right trees because of having the same set of words: a man. the sub- phrase vbz under vp in both trees gets very high attention due to having the same word is at exactly the same position. due to the chomsky normalization, the tree on the right side gets an extra dummy node x which contains vbg and rp as the child nodes. in the vector space, the words playing and harping are semantically connected which allows both of the models to align them with moderately high as well as equal probabilities. the left tree does not have any particle words which causes the model to put low attention probability when it appears on the right tree. the left tree has np as the right child of vp at level with probability which is quite close to the amount of attention pp gets as the right child of vp at the same level in the right tree. again in both of these trees, at the right most branch, the words play and violin share the same semantic space which causes them to get aligned with almost the same probabilities. the dt in this branch gets the same high probability because of appearing in both sentences at relatively similar positions.","The section details the experimental setup for evaluating generalized attention frameworks on a semantic similarity task using a dataset of sentence pairs. It covers dataset statistics, environment details, hyper-parameter settings, and model training on a GPU using various optimizers. Results are reported in terms of Pearson's and mean squared error, comparing the performance of different models on the dataset. The proposed attentive child sum tree-lstm model with cross sentence attention outperforms other models, showing significant improvements in performance. The implementation environment plays a role in model performance. The introduction of attention inside a binary tree-lstm cell improves model performance.

"previous attempts to encode the attention mechanism in tree-lstms were only successful for the child-sum tree variant as the techniques used are not easily adaptable to binary trees like the chomsky normal form constituency tree. in this paper, we have introduced two different ways of applying attention on tree structures. the second of these two methods gives superior performance for both tree variants. the proposed techniques can be used on both dependency as well as constituent tree structure. our experimental results verify the superiority of the attentive variant of tree-lstms over traditional tree-lstms and linear chain lstms on the semantic relatedness task. with our extensive in depth analysis, we showed that our proposed attention models provide a good representation of how a sentence builds semantically from the words. our generalized attention framework is adaptable to any tree like structures.","In the Conclusion section, the paper highlights the challenges of encoding the attention mechanism in tree-LSTMs for different tree variants. The authors present two methods for applying attention on tree structures, with the second method outperforming the traditional approaches for both child-sum and Chomsky normal form constituency trees. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the attentive tree-LSTMs over traditional tree-LSTMs and linear chain LSTMs in semantic relatedness tasks. The proposed attention models provide a strong semantic representation of sentence structures, and the generalized framework can be applied to various tree-like structures."

"we consider multivariate multiple regression modeling within the context of imaging genetics where interest lies in uncovering the associations between genetic variations and neuroimaging measures as quantitative traits . this problem has received a great deal of attention recently and is challenging because it combines the analysis of neuroimaging data with genetic data (see e.g., vounou et al., ; stein et al., ; silver et al., ; inkster et al., ; hibar et al., ; ge et al., ; thompson et al., ; stingo et al., ; zhu et al., ; hibar et al., ; huang et al., ; huang et al., ; lu et al., ). recent reviews of statistical issues in this area are discussed in liu and calhoun and nathoo et al. . the neuroimaging measures can serve as endophenotypes for neurological disorders such as alzheimers disease . as described in szefer et al. , the estimated heritability of late- onset ad is - percent . the largest susceptibility allele is the allele of the apolipoprotein e gene , which may play a role in to percent of ad cases. the remaining heritability of ad may be explained by many additional genetic variants and these may have a small eect. in our work, we consider the setting where interest lies in assessing the association between a moderate number of brain imaging phentoypes (e.g., rois in vounou et al., ; rois in wang et al., ; rois in zhu et al., ; rois in greenlaw et al., ) and with the number of snps ranging from between a few hundred to a few thousand. within this setting a multivariate model with regression matrix jointly characterizing the associations between all rois and genetic markers is feasible. greenlaw et al. propose a bayesian group sparse multi-task regression model where the primary focus is the use of a shrinkage prior based on a product of multivariate laplace kernels developed following the ideas of park and casella and kyung et al. . the specic prior developed is motivated by the penalized multi-task regression estimator proposed by wang et al. . this development is an eort to move from point estimation to bayesian credible intervals and fully bayesian inference. while these authors demonstrate the advantage of characterizing posterior uncertainty in their imaging genetics application to the adni study, their model makes a simplifying assumption for the covariance matrix of the imaging phenotypes, where the rst level of the model assumes: y|w, ind mv nc = , . . . , n, where y= t denotes the vector of imaging phenotypes for subject and c is the dimension of the imaging phenotype, where = , . . . , n; at denotes transpose of matrix a, w is the regression matrix; x= t , where xdenotes the vector of genetic markers for subject and d is the number of such markers. the assumed covariance structure ignores spatial correlation as well as bilateral correlation across brain hemispheres. we develop a new model that allows for this type of correlation by adopting a proper bivariate conditional autoregressive process for the errors in the regression model. while spatial models for functional magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging modalities have been developed to a large extent (see, e.g., penny et al., ; bowman, ; bowman et al., ; derado et al., ; teng et al., a; teng et al., b), to our knowledge there has been very little development of explicitly spatial models for imaging genetics. one exception is the mixture model developed by stingo et al. where an ising prior, a binary markov random eld, is used for bayesian variable selection. our model is rather dierent in both its aims and structure as it is based on a continuous bivariate markov random eld that is specied at the rst level of the model for the imaging phenotype directly. in figure we show several summaries of the data from our motivating application demon- strating the need to account for correlation across brain hemispheres. for example, the sample correlation between the volume of the right cerebral cortex and the volume of the left cerebral cortex is , and across all pairs of measurements, the median left/right correlation between corresponding phenotypes is approximately . the bivariate car structure allows us to account for this between-hemisphere correlation while also allowing us to account for within-hemisphere correlation using a graph structure based on a neighbourhood matrix. typically, models incorporating multivariate car specications are used for modelling ob- servations or spatially-varying parameters when multiple observations or parameters appear at each spatial site. for our application the use of this process is non-standard in the sense that we do not model multiple observations at each site, but rather, we figure : the correlation plot for left and right brain measures showing the bilateral correlation between brain measurements across brain hemispheres for subjects. panel presents the boxplot of all of the pairwise bilateral correlations for the brain measurements across left and right hemispheres. panel presents a scatter plot showing mean thickness of left/right frontal with correlation . panel presents a scatter plot showing the volume of left/right cerebral cortex with correlation . panel presents a scatter plot between volume of left/right cerebral white matter with correlation . pair corresponding observations on opposite hemispheres of the brain and use the bivariate spatial process to model a combination of the bilateral correlation across the left and right brain hemi- spheres as well as potential correlation within each hemisphere. as a matter of fact for the mri data considered in our application the bilateral correlation is a very strong signal in the observed data and so it is important to account for it. for the bivariate spatial model we use a separable bcar process as it is reasonable in our application to assume that the spatial covariance on the two hemispheres of the brain is similar. non-separable multivariate spatial models (see, e.g., gelfand and banerjee, ; macnab ) could be adopted for more exibility allowing the spatial structure on the two hemispheres to be dierent; however, we do not expect that this additional exibility would be useful in the current context. this spatial process is combined with a group lasso prior for the regression coecients, where each group corresponds to a single row of w. each row in this case represents the associations between a given snp and all of the phenotypes. to compute the posterior distribution we develop two algorithms, both of which are implemented in our r package bgsmtr for imaging genetics regression modelling. the package is available for download on the comprehensive r archive network . the rst algorithm is a gibbs sam- pling algorithm and the second is a faster mean-eld variational bayes approximation to the posterior distribution . within the context of hierarchical models for spatial data, mean-eld vb inference has been considered by ren et al. who make comparisons with inference from mcmc within the context of spatial process models. in addition to the computation of the posterior distribution, the bgsmtr package now incorporates bayesian fdr procedures for snp selection. this can be used alongside or as an alternative to snp selection based on credible intervals. the overall contribution of our work is four-fold. first, we develop an explicitly spatial model for imaging genetics based on the bcar process. second, we develop both an mcmc algorithm and a mean-eld vb algorithm for approximating the posterior distribution. third, we incorpo- rate bayesian fdr procedures for snp selection within the new spatial model. fourth, our new developments are implemented in the latest version of the bgsmtr r package. the remainder of this paper is structured as follows. in section , we present our new spa- tial model for imaging genetics. computation of the posterior distribution and snp selection is discussed in section section presents a simulation study evaluating the performance of the spatial model relative to a non-spatial model and inference based on mcmc relative to that from vb. in section we apply our new model to our motivating application examining data from the adni- study, examining structural brain imaging phenotypes, snps from genes, and subjects. the paper concludes with a discussion in section","The text discusses multivariate multiple regression modeling in imaging genetics to uncover associations between genetic variations and neuroimaging measures.

"let y= t and x= t denote the imaging measures at c rois and the genetic data respectively for subject , = , . . . , n, where x,j {, , } represents the number of minor alleles of the jth snp for subject . the regression model takes the form e = w t x, = , . . . , n, where w has dimensions d c and wi,j represents the association between the ith snp and the jth imaging phenotype. our model is developed for settings where the imaging data are symmetric with the same measures collected on each hemisphere of the brain. this is true when the neuroimaging data are considered at the voxel level and it is also the case for the study considered here where we analyze mri data from the adni- database preprocessed using the freesurfer v software . we conduct automated parcellation to dene volumetric and cortical thickness values from the rois considered in shen et al. , szefer et al. , and greenlaw et al. on each hemisphere leading to c = brain measures in total. as described in szefer et al. , potential confounders in the analysis are population strat- ication and apoe genotype. since true population structure is not observed, a set of principal coordinates from multidimensional scaling are used to derive proxy variables for population strat- ication in the data. we also adjust for apoe genotype, since it can account for the population stratication in the data, over and above the principal components or principal coordinates (lucotte et al. ). the response imaging measures at each brain roi are rst adjusted for the ten principal coor- dinates, as well as for dummy variables representing apoe genotype, using weighted ordinary least squares regression. the residuals from each regression are then used as the adjusted neuroimaging phenotypes . let y,i = l,i , y l,i ) be the brain summary measures obtained at the ith roi in the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere . then y= (y ,, . . . , y ,c/) is the imaging data ordered so that left-right imaging phenotype pairs are adjacent in the response vector. there are thus c/ rois on each hemisphere and we let a denote a c/c/ symmetric neighborhood matrix which in the simplest case can have binary elements, where ai,j = indicates that roi i and j are neighbors i = j, or more generally ai,j and ai,i = , i = , . . . , c/ a user input is thus a neighborhood matrix a or in the absence of user input our software implementation takes ai,j to be the average of the absolute value of the sample correlation between phenotype/roi i and phenotype/roi j, where the average is taken over left/right hemisphere. the regression model then takes the form y= w t x+ and the model for the errors is a mean-zero multivariate normal distribution of dimension c, which can be specied through a set of c/ compatible bivariate conditional distributions for l,i = l,i , l,i ), specied as follows: l,i|l, , bvn   ai. c/ x j= ai,jl,j, ai.  where, l denotes the rest after removing l,i from l, ai. = p c j= ai,j, [, ) characterizes spatial dependence with = corresponding to independence across all roi pairs and is a matrix where = / quanties within pair dependence, and with = corresponding to independence within roi pairs. as far as we are aware, this spatial model for neuroimaging data is one of the rst to explicitly model dependence across brain hemispheres in addition to accounting for local dependence. often, this left/right bilateral dependence is ignored with neuroimaging data. in our data it is a very clear and strong signal as is evident in figure as the parameter is free in the model it can be informed by the data. therefore, we expect that the posterior will reect some degree of between hemisphere correlation when it is present to a sucient degree, and will remain at roughly a diagonal form when it is not, in diseases that have major dierences across hemispheres, for example. the prior for is chosen so that it is centered on a diagonal matrix. under this new specication the rst level of the regression model takes the following form: y|w , ind mvnc ), l = , . . . , n, where mvnc denotes a c-dimensional multivariate normal distribution, is the kronecker product, da = diag{ai., i = , , c/} and as before ai. = p c j= ai,j. for the regression coecients, we let wi,j= , j = j, j= , , c , and we adopt a shrinkage prior based on a bivariate gaussian scale mixture wi,j| i , ind bvn(, i ), i | iid gamma(c + , /), inv-wishart, where and are tuning parameters controlling spatial dependence and regression sparsity re- spectively. tuning of the model is discussed in section after our discussion of computational algorithms for tting the model. the remaining hyperparameters v and s are set at v = and s = i to yield a prior that is somewhat vague, and they can be varied as part of a sensitivity analysis.","The Bayesian Spatial Regression Model discussed in the text aims to model the association between genetic data and imaging measures at various brain regions. The model accounts for population stratification and adjusts for potential confounders such as APOE genotype. It considers symmetry in imaging data collected from both hemispheres and incorporates spatial dependence across brain hemispheres, which is often overlooked in neuroimaging data analysis. The model involves neighborhood matrices to represent spatial relationships between brain regions and specifies a mean-zero multivariate normal distribution for modeling errors. Regression coefficients are informed by a shrinkage prior based on spatial dependence and regression sparsity, with tuning parameters controlling these aspects. The model's performance is discussed in relation to computational algorithms for fitting the model."
"bayesian computation posterior computation can be implemented using gibbs sampling. the update steps for this al- gorithm are listed in algorithm and their derivations are given in the supplementary material . as a faster alternative approach to computing the posterior distribution, we also develop a mean-eld vb algorithm. the approximation q to the posterior distribution p is based on constructing and optimizing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood p. assuming that q has the same support as p, the log-marginal likelihood can be written as logp = z q log{p q }d + z q log{ q p}d = eq[log{p q }] + eq[log{ q p}] = f + kl f. here, kl denotes the kullback-leibler divergence from q to p and the nal inequality is true since kl the approximation to p by q is obtained by restricting q to a manageable class of distributions and maximizing the lower bound f (which is equivalent to minimizing kl) over that class. the functional f is referred to as the evidence lower bound . in the case of mean-eld vb, the restriction of q is to a product form q = qj j= qj. in the context of our model we assume p h d y i= q)q( i ) i q where w is the ith row w . algorithm gibbs sampling algorithm set tuning parameters and . initialize w , , and repeat steps - below to obtain the desired monte carlo sample size after burn-in. let w be the ith row of w, w be the rest after removing w from w . for i = , , d, update w t as: w t mvnc( i , i), where: i = i n x = ic) (xt ic)(w t ) + n x = ic)y ! , i = hi + n x = ic) (xt ic)  , hi =  i i c  . update as: inverse-wishart where: s= n x l= c x i= c x j= bi,j y l,i y l,i t + d x i= c x j= wi,j w t i,j i + s, v= n + cd + v, y l = yl w t xl, yt l,j= (y l,j, y l,j+), wi,j= . for i = , . . . , d update i , through / i inverse-gaussian s c i , ! where: c i = tr( c x j= wi,j w t i,j) algorithm mean-eld variational bayes algorithm set tuning parameters and and convergence parameters k and . initialize q, q, q and cycle through steps - below until the absolute relative change in the evidence lower bound l is smaller than for k iterations. for i = , , d, update q)  h q i c s q) i + n x = ic)[) s q)](xt ic)  , q) q)  n x = ic)[ s q)](xt ic)  q)  + n x = ic)[ s q)]y  update sq as sq n x l= c x i= c x j= bi,j y l,i y l,i t + d x i= c x j= eq   wi,j w t i,j  q + s where: bi,j = i,j for i = , , d, update q q s eq(c i ) where: eq(c i ) = eq tr( c x j= wi,j w t i,j) update: q( i ) q + v arq( i ) q + we maximize the functional f over the qjs using a coordinate ascent procedure. the update steps for this procedure take the form qi = exp{ei} r exp{ei}di where the expectation is taken with respect to qi = q l=i ql. this leads to a set of update equations that are iterated until convergence to a local optimum. these update equations are presented in algorithm and their derivations are detailed in the supplementary material (web appendix b). on convergence, the approximation to the posterior distribution is based on as well as the solutions q) mvn), q)), i = , . . . , d, q( i ) reciprocal inverse gaussian, q), i = , . . . , d, q inverse-wishart, vq) where the statistics {q), q), i = , . . . , d}; {q, q, i = , . . . , d}; sq, vq, also referred to as variational parameters, are obtained as the output of the iterative algorithm to initialize the variational bayes algorithm, we use a ridge regression estimator obtained separately for each column of w obtained by tting ridge regression with individual scalar-valued phenotypes as the response. the ridge estimators are then used to initialize the mean of the variational posterior distribution. the output of variational bayes is then used to initialize the mcmc sampling algorithm.","The section discusses the computation and SNP selection methods for a Bayesian model.

The algorithm is initialized using ridge regression estimators, and the output is then used to initialize the MCMC sampling algorithm."
"the bayesian fdr procedure applied in our work for snp selection follows the approach developed in morris et al. , but it has been adapted and implemented for the current spatial model. we assume that we have n samples w i,j , . . . , w i,j from the posterior distribution for each of the regression coecients wi,j, i = , , d, j = , , c. let cbe a known critical value that is chosen a priori to represent an eect size of interest. given this value, we compute a posterior tail probability for the i-th snp at region j as pi,j = pr, i = , . . . , d; j = , . . . , c, which can be approximated by pi,j n pn i= i n |w i,j | > co and we replace any pi,j = with given these posterior tail probabilities and a desired expected bayesian fdr-bound , we denote by the corresponding threshold chosen so that a snp-region pair is selected if pi,j > . the cut-o can be computed by sorting {pi,j, i = , , d; j = , . . . , c} in descending order {p, i = , , d c}, then = p, with = max ( l: l x l= ) ) . the threshold is a cutpoint on the posterior probabilities that controls the expected bayesian fdr below level . the value of ccan be chosen based on prior knowledge of what constitutes an eect size of interest, or in the absence of such knowledge, it can be chosen based on the data.","In Bayesian False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis for SNP selection, a modified version of the approach by Morris et al. is utilized for a spatial model. Posterior tail probabilities are calculated for SNP-region pairs based on regression coefficients. A critical value is chosen to represent the effect size of interest, and a threshold is set based on desired Bayesian FDR control. SNP-region pairs are selected if their posterior tail probabilities exceed this threshold, determined by sorting and selecting a cutoff point. The critical value can be selected based on prior knowledge or data-driven methods."
"to compare the spatial and non-spatial models and to choose values for the tuning parameters, one option is the use of the waic . this criterion can be computed from posterior simulation output and takes the form waic = n x l= log ew, + n x l= v arw, where p is the multivariate normal density function associated with the conditional autoregressive model , and the expectation and variance are taken with respect to the posterior distribution, with lower values being preferred. an alternative approach to tuning the model is to use a simple modied moment estimator based on the ridge regression estimator that we use to initialize vb. this estimator implicitly uses cross-validation which is used to tune the ridge estimator and is much faster than applying cv directly to our bayesian model. the estimator takes the form = dc max{, } x i,j w ri,j , and its form is derived in web appendix c. for vb we use the moment estimate for and x the value of = corresponding to a reasonable degree of spatial dependence on the graph represented by the neighbourhood matrix a. the mcmc algorithm is then initialized using the output of vb and the value of can be set at the moment estimate while can be chosen using the waic. the waic can also be used to compare the spatial model with the non-spatial model. while the waic can be used for selection of , we have found that selection of using the waic can result in patterns where waic decreases in a monotone fashion as increases. in these situations, we recommend that either the modied moment estimate is used or that the results be summarized over a range of values for through the regularization path.","The text discusses model selection and tuning methods for spatial and non-spatial models. One option is using the WAIC criterion, computed from posterior simulation output, to compare models and choose tuning parameters. An alternative approach involves a modified moment estimator based on ridge regression to initialize VB, which implicitly uses cross-validation for tuning and is faster than applying CV directly to the Bayesian model. The estimator considers spatial dependence on the neighborhood matrix. The MCMC algorithm is initialized using the output of VB, with the moment estimate used for one parameter and the WAIC for another. The text suggests using the modified moment estimator if the WAIC decreases monotonously with increasing values, or summarizing results over a range of values via the regularization path."
"we conduct a simulation study where the dimension of the data is the same as that in our motivating application with structural brain imaging phenotypes, snps from genes, and subjects. the data are simulated from the spatial model with parameter values set at the estimates obtained from the real data. we use simulation replicates and run the mcmc algorithms for both the spatial model and the non-spatial model for iterations with iterations used as burn-in for each replicate, and we run the variational bayes algorithm to convergence of the elbo, where convergence is declared when the absolute relative change in the elbo is smaller than = for k = consecutive iterations. the tuning parameters are chosen using the waic over a coarse grid for the spatial model implemented via mcmc; set using the default approach in the r package for the model of greenlaw et al. (based on ve-fold cross-validation over a grid of possible values with out-of-sample prediction based on an approximate posterior mode, the estimator of wang et al. , that can be computed quickly) and using our moment based approach to obtain for vb, while the spatial parameter is held xed at the default value of = for vb (the true value set when simulating the data is = ). five measures are used for comparison in this study and are listed in table for the best overall estimation performance, the spatial model implemented using mcmc has an average mean-squared error of , followed by the non-spatial model with an average mse of and nally the spatial model implemented with vb with an average mse of . here, the average is taken over the , regression coecients in the model. next, we examine the correlation between the posterior mean estimates of vec and the true values averaged over simulation replicates. the spatial model implemented using mcmc has the best performance , followed by the non- spatial model implemented via mcmc and then the spatial model implemented using vb . the average-squared bias is lowest for the non-spatial model , followed by the spatial model implemented with mcmc and nally the spatial model implemented using vb has the highest average-squared bias. both the non-spatial and spatial models appear to exhibit adequate coverage probability overall when implemented with mcmc while the variational bayes implementation of the spatial model exhibits coverage of % equal- tail credible intervals that is slightly lower at . the average posterior standard deviation obtained from the spatial model is slightly larger than that obtained from the non-spatial model perhaps indicating that the spatial model is adequately accounting for the dependence. as is typical with variational bayes the posterior standard deviation is underestimated. this arises from the kullback-leibler objective function kl for variational bayes which under-penalizes approximations that are under-dispersed. to evaluate the empirical fdr of the bayesian fdr approach when the expected bayesian fdr is controlled with = , leading to the threshold for posterior probabilities =, we conduct an additional simulation replicates where the error structure underlying the simulated data is again set to that obtained from the real data application. all but snps have their coecients set to exactly zero while rows of w have coecients set to wij = , rows have coecients set to wij = and the remaining rows have coecients set to wij = here we evaluate the empirical fdr for the spatial model and both of its implementations. the methodology of greenlaw et al. uses credible intervals rather than bayesian fdr for snp selection. both the vb and mcmc algorithms use the moment estimate for the empirical proportion of false discoveries averaged over simulation replicates is reported in supplementary material table for both vb and mcmc as a function of c. we note that these cvalues are based on each simulated response matrix y having its columns centered and scaled. the empirical fdr appears to drop to with increasing cfaster with the mcmc implementation which is consistent with the vb implementation being more liberal in selecting snps.","The section details a simulation study conducted to compare the performance of spatial and non-spatial models in estimating regression coefficients. The study uses data simulated from a spatial model with parameter values set based on real data estimates. Multiple algorithms, including MCMC and variational Bayes, are employed for estimation. The spatial model implemented with MCMC shows the best overall estimation performance, followed by the non-spatial model and then the spatial model implemented with variational Bayes. Results show that the spatial model with MCMC has lower average MSE and squared bias compared to the other models. Coverage probability analysis indicates that both spatial and non-spatial models perform adequately with MCMC, while the variational Bayes implementation of the spatial model shows slightly lower coverage. Posterior standard deviations suggest that the spatial model effectively accounts for dependence. The empirical false discovery rate is evaluated, with results showing differences between the MCMC and variational Bayes implementations in SNP selection."
"we apply our spatial model as well as the group sparse multi-task regression model of greenlaw et al. to mri and genetic data collected from n = subjects from the adni- database. the genetic data comprise snps belonging to the top alzheimers disease candidate genes listed on the alzgene database as of june , the data presented here are queried from the genome build as of december , from the adni- data. after quality control and imputation steps, the genetic data used for this study include snps from the targeted genes discussed in szefer et al. . the freely available software package plink is used for genomic quality control. subjects are included if their genotyping data is available, they have a baseline mri scan, and they have at least one additional follow-up baseline scan. among all snps, only snps belonging to the top ad candidate genes listed on the alzgene database as of june , , are selected after the standard quality control and imputation steps. the qc criteria for the snp data include call rate check per subject and per snp marker, gender check, sibling pair identication, the hardy-weinberg equilibrium test, marker removal by the minor allele frequency and population stratication. our thresholds for snp and subject exclusion are the same as in wang et al. with three exceptions. in the data quality control step, we used a stricter minimum call rate of % on snps vs. wang et al.s call rate of %. to assign snps to genes, we use a genome build from december whereas these authors use a genome build from september , and use all subjects with a baseline measurement whereas we choose subjects with a baseline mri scan and a scan at at least one additional time point in the longitudinal study. the response measures are obtained by preprocessing the mri data using the freesurfer v software which conducts automated parcellation to dene volumetric and cortical thickness values from the rois considered in szefer et al. and greenlaw et al. on each hemi- sphere of the brain, leading to c = brain measures in total. these rois are chosen based on prior knowledge that they are related to alzheimers disease. each of the response variables are adjusted for age, gender, education, handedness, baseline total intracranial volume , po- tential population stratication and apoe genotype and centered to have zero-sample-mean and unit-sample-variance. we t our new spatial model to these data using both algorithm and algorithm . in addition, we t the non-spatial model of greenlaw et al. using the mcmc sampler derived therein, with the tuning parameters for the non-spatial model set at = and = based on the values selected in greenlaw et al. . in all cases, mcmc sampling is run for , iterations with the initial , iterations discarded. the required computation time for the spatial model is hours on a single core (-ghz xeon x) with gb of ram, while the computation for the non-spatial model is hrs. some trace plots and mcmc convergence diagnostics are presented in supplementary material web appendix e and these demonstrate rapid convergence and good mixing of the mcmc sampling chains. the vb algorithm is run to convergence and requires minutes with the elbo converging in approximately iterations. the tuning parameter is set based on the moment estimator and we set = for vb. the convergence of vb based on successive values of the elbo is depicted in figure figure : variational bayes - convergence of the evidence lower bound for the adni mri and genetic data considered in the application. supplementary material figure presents the waic computed for a number of dierent choices of the tuning parameters and for the values of = and = , , the value of the waic is , while the waic is able to identify a value for , it is monotone decreasing as a function of we will thus summarize the results over several values of the waic obtained for the non-spatial model with value of the tuning parameters used in greenlaw et al. ( = and = ) is , figure presents the number of snps chosen by the spatial model for each roi using bayesian fdr as a function of the tuning parameter for both gibbs sampling and vb. as expected, the curves are monotone decreasing but we note that their shapes dier when comparing the algorithms. in particular, vb selects a larger number of snps at all values of we suggest that the vb algorithm be used for obtaining starting values to initialize the mcmc as well as a tool to gain some initial insight into the data while the mcmc sampler runs to completion. this is useful because the mcmc sampler requires a relatively long run time, and the vb algorithm can be used initially while the mcmc sampler runs . figure : adni- data - relationship between the number of selected snps in each region and each region is represented with a curve in each panel of the gure. the left panel shows this relationship for mcmc combined with bayesian fdr while the right panel shows the same relationship for vb with bayesian fdr . for the values of the tuning parameters = , = , , the average number of snps selected per roi is , while more than half of the rois have no snps selected. in total, snps across all rois are selected and these are listed in table of the supplementary material along with the corresponding phenotypes that they are associated with. with the vb approximation, snps are selected, and the set of snp-roi pairs selected by mcmc is a proper subset of the set selected by vb. in addition, the subset of snps and phenotypes also selected by the approach of greenlaw et al. where the marginal posterior % credible interval is used for snp selection are also highlighted in bold in table of the supplementary material. considering all three approaches, a consistent signal is found at the apoe gene, where all three methods select snp rs and the bayesian fdr procedure selects this snp for four phenotypes, namely, the middle temporal gyrus thickness on the right hemisphere, supramarginal gyrus thickness on the right hemisphere, mean thickness of the caudal midfrontal, rostral midfrontal, superior frontal, lateral orbitofrontal, and medial orbitofrontal gyri and frontal pole on the right hemisphere, and the mean thickness of the inferior temporal, middle temporal, and superior temporal gyri on the right hemisphere. we note that the selected associations for this snp all correspond to rois in the right brain hemisphere. the associations between the genetic signal represented in our analysis by apoe snp rs with phenotypes on the right hemisphere of the brain may be of potential interest for further investigation. the associated point estimates and % equal-tail credible intervals for all phenotypes and apoe snp rs are presented in table of the supplementary material and a subset of these results for phenotypes is presented in table overall, there is broad agreement based on the overlap of the interval estimates, though, we also see a number of examples where the % interval estimate obtained from the spatial model includes the value while the corresponding interval estimate for the non-spatial model does not include zero. the higher bias arising from vb in the simulation studies may also be apparent in the results presented in table the interval estimates arising from vb appear to be slightly more narrow than those obtained from mcmc, but not to a large degree, and this may also be reected in the selection rates depicted in figure which are slightly higher. this is consistent with the coverage probabilities found in the rst simulation study. another consistent signal is found at the ace gene with snp rs, which is found associated with rois. we note that all but one of these rois is in the right hemisphere, and three of these rois are in common with the rois selected for this snp by greenlaw et al. . in figure we indicate the snps chosen for each roi, where the snps are grouped on the x-axis by gene and the rois are grouped in left/right pairs on the y-axis. the selected snps for each roi are shown for tuning parameter values = and = , in both cases the value of the spatial tuning parameter for the car model is set at = as suggested by supplementary material figure examining figure , two rois stand out has having a relatively broad genetic signal that persists even as the tuning parameter increases from = to = , these are left- supramarg and left-suptemporal (thickness of the left superior temporal gyrus). for the case where = , phenotype left-supramarg is associated with snps and this decreases to snps when = , when = phenotype left-suptemporal is associated with snps and this decreases to snps when = , this is to be compared with the average number of snps selected over all rois when = , which is just the regularization paths for these two regions are shown in supplementary material figure where the snps having the most persistent signal across values of are highlighted. these include snp rs for the thickness of the left supramarginal gyrus and rs for the thickness of the left superior temporal gyrus.","The section discusses the application of a spatial model and a group sparse multi-task regression model to MRI and genetic data collected from subjects in the ADNI database. The genetic data include SNPs from Alzheimer's disease candidate genes. Quality control steps are taken for the genetic data. Response variables from MRI data are adjusted and analyzed. The spatial model is compared to the non-spatial model, showing computational time differences. Variational Bayes algorithm is used for initial analysis while MCMC sampler runs. Selected SNPs and associated phenotypes are identified, with consistent signals found at certain genes. Results show overlap and differences between spatial and non-spatial models. The ACE gene also shows associations with certain phenotypes. Specific ROIs exhibit persistent genetic signals across different tuning parameters."
"we have developed a spatial multi-task regression model for relating genetic data to imaging phe- notypes. the error structure for the imaging phenotype is based on a computationally convenient proper bivariate conditional autoregressive model, which allows us to account for bilateral correla- tion across brain hemispheres while also allowing us to account for within-hemisphere correlation using a graph structure. examination of the data can assist in the determination of whether a model allowing for correlation is required. in our case it is clear that a model accounting for corre- lation is indeed required for bilateral correlation. empirical correlation between neighbouring regions can also be computed to determine if a simpler model should be considered. examination of alternative spatial models and comparisons with respect to estimation, inference figure : adni- data: snps chosen with the spatial model t using gibbs sampling and bayesian fdr are highlighted in red

robustness relative to that currently implemented under dierent settings will be part of future work. future developments may also incorporate the bayesian false discovery probability proposed by wakeeld et al. which allows the user to account explicitly for the cost of false discoveries and the cost of false non-discovery. with regards to the two computational algorithms, we recommend that the approximate vb procedures be used to initialize the mcmc algorithm and also to obtain an initial insight into the data while the mcmc sampler runs. it appears that vb combined with bayesian fdr tends to be more liberal in the selection of snps, and in our application the snp-roi pairs selected by mcmc + bayesian fdr are a proper subset of that selected by vb + bayesian fdr. nevertheless, figure suggests that the approximation can be reasonable when good initializations are used. acknowledgements research is supported by funding from the natural sciences and engineering research

"recurrent neural networks are well suited to supervised learning problems where the dataset has a sequential nature. time series forecasting should not be an exception. rnns are essentially neural networks with memory. they can remember things from the past, which is obviously useful for predicting time-dependent targets. yet, applying them to time series forecasting is not a trivial task. the aim of this article is to review some practices that can help rnns deliver useful forecasts.","Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are ideal for supervised learning with sequential data, making them suitable for time series forecasting.

"the objective of supervised learning is to predict something from data. a train- ing set of an output and some input variables is fed to an algorithm that learns to predict the target values. the output may be categorical (classi- cation) or continuous . the task of the algorithm is to deliver high quality predictions, all by itself, extracting the required knowledge solely from the available data. neural networks are a popular framework for supervised learning a network- like system of weighted summations and dierentiable functions that can learn astoundingly complex things. usually, variants of gradient descent together with backpropagation are used to nd the optimal values of the network weights. this is all simple and intuitive, yet the resulting networks are usually gabor.petnehazi@science.unideb.hu arxiv:v jan dicult for people to understand. there are so many weights and connections that we just wonder how the system produced the results. we dont understand neural networks, but we like them. the reason for their ever high popularity is simple: they are good. they can learn arbitrarily complex functions, and they often provide excellent predictions for pretty dicult machine learning prob- lems. nns are widely used in machine learning, time series prediction is just one ex- ample application. werbos and werbos made a pioneering work in the eld of neural networks by developing a general formulation of backpropaga- tion. werbos applied the method to forecasting, and compared it to traditional forecasting methods. tang et al. also made a neural networks vs. box- jenkins comparison and found that nns outperform the box-jenkins model for series with short memory. for series with long memory, both methods pro- duced similar results. faraway and chateld compared neural networks with box-jenkins and holt-winters methods for forecasting and found that the design of network architecture and the choice of input variables require great care, and so applying neural networks in black box mode is not a good idea. they also found that increasing the number of hidden nodes may deteriorate out-of-sample performance. zhang and qi found that neural networks are not able to capture season- ality by default, and deseasonalization and detrending can help their forecasting performance. according to balkin and ord , dierencing is unnecessary for neural network based forecasting, but a log transformation may be bene- cial. zhang et al. gives a detailed review of neural networks for forecasting. gamboa provides a more recent review of the applications of deep learning to time series data.","Supervised learning aims to predict outcomes from data using algorithms like neural networks, which are effective for complex tasks. Neural networks use weighted summations and differentiable functions, with optimization methods like gradient descent and backpropagation to learn from data. Despite their complexity, neural networks excel at learning intricate functions and are widely used in machine learning, including time series prediction. Studies have shown that neural networks often outperform traditional forecasting methods, but careful architecture design and input variable selection are crucial. Some challenges include capturing seasonality and choosing appropriate transformations. Deep learning applications to time series data have been reviewed extensively, showing the ongoing relevance and advancements in this field."
"rnns are neural networks for sequential data hereby we apply them to time series. the main idea behind recurrent neural networks is using not only the in- put data, but also the previous outputs for making the current prediction. this idea makes a lot sense we could build neural networks passing values forward in time. however, such simple solutions usually do not work as expected. they are hard to train and they are forgetful. rather, we need to have a system with some kind of memory. there are two popular and ecient rnn models that work really well: long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit.","Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data, such as time series. They incorporate both input data and previous outputs to make current predictions, allowing for information to be passed forward in time. However, simple RNN solutions are difficult to train and may be forgetful. To address this, more advanced RNN models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have been developed, which have proven effective in maintaining memory and enhancing performance."
"long short-term memory is a gated mem- ory unit for neural networks. it has gates that manage the contents of the memory. these gates are simple logistic functions of weighted sums, where the weights might be learnt by backpropagation. it means that, even though it seems a bit complicated, the lstm perfectly ts into the neural network and its training process. it can learn what it needs to learn, remember what it needs to remember, and recall what it needs to recall, without any special training or optimization. the input gate and the forget gate manage the cell state , which is the long-term memory. the output gate produces the output vector or hidden state , which is the memory focused for use. this memory system enables the network to remember for a long time, which was badly missing from vanilla recurrent neural networks. it = sigmoid ft = sigmoid ot = sigmoid ct = ft ct + it tanh ht = ot tanh","Summary:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specialized memory unit used in neural networks. It includes gates that control memory contents, which are adjusted using weighted sums learned through backpropagation. LSTM integrates smoothly into neural network training, allowing it to learn, remember, and recall information effectively without specific training. The input and forget gates handle the long-term memory state, while the output gate generates the output vector or hidden state for immediate use. This memory architecture enhances network retention capabilities compared to standard recurrent neural networks."
"gated recurrent unit is essentially a simplied lstm. it has the exact same role in the network. the main dierence is in the number of gates and weights gru is somewhat simpler. it has gates. since it does not have an output gate, there is no control over the memory content. the update gate controls the information ow from the previous activation, and the addition of new information as well , while the reset gate is inserted into the candidate activation. overall, it is pretty similar to lstm. from these dierences alone, it is hard to tell, which one is the better choice for a given problem. for a comparison, see chung et al. . zt = sigmoid rt = sigmoid ht = zt ht + tanh + bh)","The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a simplified version of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

Overall, the GRU is similar to LSTM, making it challenging to determine the better choice for a given problem. A detailed comparison can be found in the work by Chung et al."
"though it is probably not their primary application, lstm and gru net- works are often used for time series forecasting. gers et al. used lstms with peephole connections to learn temporal distances. malhotra et al. used stacked lstm networks to detect anomalies in time series. guo et al. proposed an adaptive gradient learning method for rnns that enables them to make robust predictions for time series with outliers and change points. hsu incorporated autoencoder into lstm to improve its forecasting per- formance. cinar et al. proposed an extended attention mechanism to capture periods and model missing values in time series. bandara et al. used lstms on groups of similar time series identied by clustering techniques. laptev et al. applied rnns to special event forecasting and found that neural networks might be a better choice than classical time series methods when the number, the length and the correlation of the time series are high. che et al. built a gru-based model with a decay mechanism to capture informative missingness in multivariate time series. several attempts have been made on better understanding rnns. karpathy et al. explored the source of recurrent neural networks performance with performance comparisons and error analysis on character level language models. van der westhuizen and lasenby used dierent datasets to visualize the operations of lstms. greet al. compared the performance of several lstm variants, and found that the forget gate and the output activation func- tion are the most important elements of an lstm block. chang et al. proposed a feature ranking method using variational dropout (hinton et al. ). some studies tried to nd ways to measure the uncertainty associated with the time series forecasts of recurrent neural networks. zhu and laptev made uncertainty estimates using monte carlo dropout and an encoder-decoder framework of lstm units. caley et al. constructed prediction intervals for convolutional lstms using bootstrapping. here we are going to explore dierent aspects of rnn-based time series forecast- ing, and introduce an end-to-end framework for producing meaningful forecasts.","Recurrent neural networks, particularly LSTM and GRU architectures, are commonly used for time series forecasting.

"feature engineering lstm and gru networks can learn and memorize the characteristics of time series. it is not so easy though, especially when we only have a short series of values to learn from. smart feature engineering can help. there are very few things whose future values we certainly know. time is one such thing we always know how it passes. therefore, we can use it to make forecasts, even for multiple steps ahead into the future, without increasing uncertainty. all we have to do is extracting useful features that our algorithm can easily interpret. time series components, such as trend or seasonality can be encoded into input variables, just like any deterministic event or condition. time-shifted values of the target variable might also be useful predictors. features are usually normalized before being fed to the neural network. it is benecial for the training process. two popular choices for rescaling the variables are the minmax scaler and the standard scaler . x = x min max min x = x mean sd . lags lagging means going some steps back in time. to predict the future, the past is our best resource it is not surprising that lagged values of the target variable are quite often used as inputs for forecasting. lags of any number of time steps might be used. the only drawback of using lagged variables is that we lose the rst observations those whose shifted values are unknown. this might be a matter when the time series is short. . trend trend can be grabbed by features indicating the passage of time. a single variable of equidistant increasing numbers might be enough for that. . seasonality we may try to nd repetitive patterns in the time series by encoding seasonal variations. there are dierent ways to do this. one-hot encoding is a reasonable choice. hereby, we treat seasonality as cate- gorical variables, and use dummy variables to indicate the current time interval in the seasonal cycle. it is simple and intuitive. however, it can not really grab cyclicality, since the distance between intervals does not matter during the encoding. it means that two successive, and possibly similar, time intervals are represented by just as independent values as any two randomly chosen time intervals. also, one-hot encoding uses an individual variable to represent each unique value, which may be inconvenient when we have a large number of time intervals. these deciencies of the dummy variable approach lead us to another encoding method. we can place the values on a single continuous scale instead of using several binary variables. by assigning increasing equidistant values to the successive time intervals, we can grab the similarity of adjacent pairs, but this encoding sees the rst and the last intervals as being farthest from each other, which is a bad mistake. this may be healed by transforming the values using either the sine or the cosine transformation. in order to have each interval uniquely represented, we should use both. x = sin  x max  x = cos  x max  . dummy indicators we can use simple indicator variables for events or conditions that we consider important. holidays are always special and are spent in unusual ways. hence, a binary variable indicating holidays may carry information about the time series. also, an indicator of working days or working hours could be useful. feature importances neural networks consist of connected simple functions of weighted sums. it is not a dicult structure, yet interpreting the meaning and role of the numerous backpropagation learnt weights is pretty hard. it is the reason for too often calling them black boxes, and not even trying to understand them. recurrent networks are even a bit more complicated. this diculty of interpretation makes neural networks somewhat less valuable. we should naturally always prefer a simpler, more interpretable model, when having multiple choices with about the same forecasting performance. so, we should brighten the black box, at least partially. a measure of variable importance could tell something about what is happen- ing within the neural network, yet quantifying importance is not trivial. several methods have been proposed, see gevrey et al. or olden et al. for a comparison. here we are going to use mean decrease accuracy a method that is usually applied to random forests . it is also called permutation ac- curacy. we are permuting the variables, one by one, and calculate a measure of accuracy for each deliberately corrupted model. the feature whos random permutation leads to the largest drop in accuracy is considered the most im- portant. it is a simple, intuitive measure, and it can easily be applied not just to random forests, but to any neural network or any other supervised learning algorithm as well. two metrics will be used as measures of accuracy: r and mda. r or coef- cient of determination is a goodness of t measure for regression. it usually ranges from to , though it can take on negative values as well. mda or mean directional accuracy is the accuracy of the binary variable indicating the directional change of consecutive values. mean decrease accuracy can be calcu- lated from both accuracy measures. variables are permuted separately, so the importance scores should be inter- preted and evaluated independently. variable importances do not add up. hence, when the same piece of information is encoded into multiple variables, we are going to calculate the maximum of the scores, and use it as the impor- tance of that group of variables. feature importances can be estimated from both regression accuracy and direc- tional accuracy of one-step predictions on dierent validation sets. it means there are quite some combinations, and it is likely that not the exact same variables will prove to be important in all cases. therefore, it is worth computing some descriptive statistics of the dierent calculations to get a summarized view of the actual roles of input features. the importance scores are usually normalized to sum to","LSTM and GRU networks can effectively learn and memorize time series characteristics with smart feature engineering, especially in cases with limited data. Extracting useful features, such as time series components like trend and seasonality, can enhance forecasting accuracy. Variables are typically normalized before being inputted into neural networks using methods like min-max scaling and standard scaling. Lagging values, trend, seasonality, and dummy indicators for events can all be important features in time series forecasting. To interpret neural networks better, variable importance measures like mean decrease accuracy can be used, providing insights into the significance of different features within the model._feature importances are assessed using methods like regression accuracy and directional accuracy, with importance scores normalized for comparison."
"point predictions our recurrent neural networks are primarily suited for one-step-ahead forecast- ing. we have a single output variable containing the value that immediately follows the corresponding sequence of inputs. this simple framework can also be used for multi-step-ahead forecasting in an iterative manner. when the target variables lagged values are the only non-deterministic features, we may use the predicted values as inputs for making further predictions. it is a bit risky though, since we roll the errors forward.","The text discusses how recurrent neural networks are well-suited for one-step-ahead forecasting by utilizing a single output variable that predicts the immediate future value based on input sequences. This framework can also be extended for multi-step-ahead forecasting by iteratively predicting future values using previously predicted outputs. However, using predicted values as inputs for further predictions carries some risk as it involves propagating errors forward."
"neural networks have an important disadvantage: they only provide point es- timates. we only get some forecasted values, without any indicators of the predictions condence. prediction intervals contain future values with a given probability. such interval estimates could make our forecasts more meaningful, though producing them for neural networks is not easy. we are going to use the computationally expensive method of bootstrapping. the idea of bootstrapping was introduced by efron et al. . this is actually a very simple method for estimating the quality of estimates. bootstrapping takes resamples with replacement from the original dataset to make separate forecasts. the variability of those independent estimates is a good measure of the condence of the estimation. efron and tibshirani wrote a comprehensible review of bootstrapping, focusing on applications. they state that the bootstrap method has very nice properties for estimating standard errors, and computational intensity, being its main weakness, is less and less of a case as computation is getting cheaper and faster. efron and tibshirani also note that the bootstrap can be used to construct condence intervals in an automatic way, while alternative methods require several tricks to perform satisfactorily. bootstrapping is not only useful for quantifying the condence in our predic- tions, but also for improving the forecasts themselves. ensemble methods com- bine multiple algorithms to deliver better predictions. bootstrapping is one way to construct an ensemble. there are main approaches to ensemble learning . either we can create models in a coordinated fashion, and take a weighted vote of the components, or we can construct independent models with a diverse set of results, then combine them to let the disagreements cancel out. bootstrap resampling can be used to construct an ensemble of this latter type. bagging or bootstrap aggregating is an ensemble method that trains a learning algorithm on multiple independent bootstrap samples, and aggregates the re- sulting predictors by voting or averaging. it was introduced by breiman . this simple ensemble can improve unstable single predictors, but it can slightly degrade the performance of more stable ones. hence, applying bagging is not always a good idea, but it can work very well for some learning algorithms. di- etterich remarks that since the generalization ability of neural networks is very good, they may benet less from ensemble methods. still, we may hope that bagging can bring some improvement to our point predictions, but the main reason for applying the method is the construction of prediction intervals. bootstrapping has been applied to compute condence and prediction intervals for neural networks by, e.g., paass , heskes , carney et al. . khosravi et al. compared four leading techniques for constructing predic- tion intervals, including the bootstrap. they conclude that there is no method that outperforms all the others in all respects. tibshirani compared two dierent bootstraps to two other methods for estimating the standard error of neural network predictions. tibshirani concludes that the bootstraps perform best. here we are going to use a method similar to the one proposed by heskes . we take bootstrap samples of sequences, rather than individual observations. a separate rnn is trained on each bootstrap sample. our nal prediction is a simple average of all individual model predictions. we must make a distinction between condence intervals and prediction inter- vals. these two are easily confused. condence intervals quantify how well we can approximate the true regression. the condence is in the estimate of the regression the mean of the target distribution. to compute the intervals, we rst construct the bagged estimator by averaging the resulting estimates of all bootstrap runs . yi = nrun nrun x run= yrun i now we have the center, and we just need to nd the variance and an appro- priate value from the t-distribution to calculate the endpoints of the condence interval . we assume that the true regression follows a normal distribution given the estimate. yi = nrun nrun x run= ( yrun i yi) cii = [ yi tconf yi, yi + tconf yi] prediction intervals quantify how well we can approximate the target values. this measure is more important in practice, but it is a bit more dicult to estimate. while the construction of condence intervals required nothing more than the means and standard deviations of our resampled estimates, here we need some more sophisticated computations to estimate the noise variance of the regression . e[(y y)] y we train another network with almost the same structure as the one used for making the time series predictions, and use it to predict the remaining residuals from the input values. r i = max((yi yi) yi, ) this residual predictor is trained on the validation set of observations randomly left out in the current bootstrap run. it is a smart data recycling method. heskes proposed loglikelihood as the loss function, we apply the similar formula used by khosravi et

i]","Neural networks typically provide point estimates without indicating the confidence of predictions, making the creation of prediction intervals important for meaningful forecasts. Bootstrapping is a computationally expensive method used to estimate prediction intervals by taking resamples with replacement from the original dataset to calculate the confidence of estimation. Bootstrapping can also be used to improve forecasts through ensemble methods like bagging, which aggregates multiple predictors for better predictions. While neural networks generally have good generalization ability, applying ensemble methods like bagging can still enhance point predictions and construct prediction intervals. Techniques like bootstrapping have been compared to other methods for estimating standard errors of neural network predictions, with bootstraps often performing best. A method similar to one proposed by Heskes involves training separate recurrent neural networks on bootstrap samples of sequences and averaging all individual model predictions for the final prediction. It's important to differentiate between confidence intervals, which quantify the approximation of the true regression, and prediction intervals, which quantify the approximation of target values. The construction of prediction intervals requires more sophisticated computations to estimate noise variance, typically involving training another neural network to predict residuals from input values."
"point forecasts we are going to obtain a train and a test set by splitting the time series at one point. it means that we always test the future. we would expect the algorithm to tell the future, so this choice of validation is natural for such forecasting problems. yet, the test set consists of a single time period, so this method may not be entirely sucient for evaluating the model performance. bootstrapping provides an alternative validation set. an average bootstrap sample contains about % of the individual observations, or in our case, it contains about % of all available data subsequences. the remaining sub- sequences do not participate in the training process, so we may use them for validation purposes. we are going to call the bootstrap left-out dataset validation set, and the future dataset test set just for the sake of distinction. they have the same evalua- tion purpose. both sets will be used to evaluate the one-step-ahead forecasting ability of our recurrent neural networks. the separate test set, being a complete chronologi- cally ordered series of subseries, may also be used for iterative multi-step-ahead forecasting. regression and classication metrics are going to be applied in order to evaluate the forecasted values and the predicted changes of direction as well. we are calculating root mean squared error , symmetric mean absolute per- centage error , coecient of determination , mean absolute error and median absolute error regression metrics to measure the forecast t. we are also calculating the accuracy , precision , recall and f classication scores to evaluate the directional forecasts. the clas- sication metrics are computed on the following variables: yt = ytyt> and yt = ytyt> rmse(y, y) = v u u t n n x i= (yi yi) smape(y, y) = n n x i= |yi yi| ( + | yi|)/ r(y, y) = pn i=(yi yi) pn i=(yi y) mae(y, y) = n n x i= |yi yi| medae(y, y) = median(|y y|, . . . , |yn yn|) accuracy( y, y) = n n x i= yi= yi precision( y, y) = pn i= yi= and yi= pn i= yi= recall( y, y) = pn i= yi= and yi= pn i= yi= f( y, y) = precision recall precision + recall mse is used as the loss function during the training process. applying other evaluation metrics is also reasonable, since they all have dierent properties and interpretation. mae is easier to interpret than the square root of mse, medae is more robust to outliers, r score measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, smape measures the error in percentage terms, ranging from to %. classication accuracy score simply measures the proportion of changes whose direction we guessed right. precision, recall and f are binary metrics. an increase in the target variable is now treated as the positive class. hence, in our case, precision is the proportion of forecasted rises that were right, and recall is the proportion of actual rises that we guessed right. f score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. we may get a better view of the forecasts quality by using these various metrics together. also, we can draw a confusion matrix to evaluate all kinds of errors and correct forecasts at once.","The text discusses validation methods for forecasting using point forecasts. It suggests using a train and test set split for one-step-ahead forecasting, and bootstrapping to create an alternative validation set. The evaluation includes regression and classification metrics such as root mean squared error, accuracy, precision, recall, and F score. Different metrics offer unique insights, with MAE being easier to interpret, medAE being robust to outliers, R score measuring variance explained, and SMAPE indicating error as a percentage. Classification metrics focus on directional forecasts, with precision, recall, and F score helping to measure correctly predicted rises. Using a combination of these metrics and a confusion matrix can provide a comprehensive view of forecast quality."
"the quality of prediction intervals should also be evaluated. we use the same prediction interval assessment measures as khosravi et al. . picp or prediction interval coverage probability is the proportion of ob- servations that fall into the interval. the wider the interval, the higher the coverage it is reasonable to quantify the size of the interval as well. mpiw or mean prediction interval width does exactly that. nmpiw or normal- ized mean prediction interval width is the width normalized by the range of the target variable. this metric allows for comparisons across datasets. cwc or coverage width-based criterion is a combined metric that takes into ac- count both coverage and width. it has hyperparameters that we can set: corresponds to the nominal condence level, while magnies the dierence between and picp. the lower cwc the higher quality. picp = n n x i= yi mpiw = n n x i= nmpiw = mpiw r cwc = nmpiw))","Prediction intervals play a critical role in assessing the quality of forecasts. Parameters such as Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) determine the proportion of observations within the interval, with wider intervals providing higher coverage. Mean Prediction Interval Width (MPIW) quantifies the size of the interval, while Normalized Mean Prediction Interval Width (NMPIW) normalizes the width for cross-dataset comparisons. The Coverage Width-Based Criterion (CWC) considers both coverage and width, with lower CWC values indicating higher quality forecasts. Key hyperparameters, such as the nominal confidence level and magnification of differences between PICP and the specified level, influence the CWC metric."

"the dataset is available in an hourly resolution, which allows us to construct several seasonal variables. it contains counts of bike rentals for capital bike- share at washington, d.c., usa for years. we disregard the available weather information, and use time-determined features only. the pandas library (mck- inney et al. ) was used during the data preparation. cyclical features were encoded using the sine and cosine transformations. the following time components are encoded: season of year, month of year, week of year, day of week and hour of day. using all these features together is probably a bit redundant, but hopefully the neural network is smart enough to handle it. some binary variables are used to indicate if the time is afternoon, working hour, holiday, working day, start of quarter or start of month. lagged values of the target variable are also used as inputs: the preceding timesteps values, and lagged values of , and hours. each feature was scaled between zero and one using minmax scaler. variable importances were calculated on the bootstrap left-out validation set and on the separate test set as well, using the single step forecasts. two ac- curacy metrics were applied: r as a measure of goodness-of-t, and mda as a measure of directional accuracy. this setting led to dierent estimates of variable importance . those estimates were then averaged into a single list of importances . feature importances are displayed with the following notation: r regression metric ; c classication metric ; v bootstrap left-out valida- tion set; t future test set. these importance scores were only computed for one-step forecasts, since shuing the values of the iterative multi-step forecasts was inconvenient. lagged values were divided into groups: recent values (lags of , and r-v c-v r-t c-t season day of week month week of year lagged lagged hour holiday afternoon working hour working day month start quarter start trend figure : feature importances, detailed mean std season day of week month week of year lagged lagged hour holiday afternoon working hour working day month start quarter start trend figure : feature importances, summary mean std season day of week month week of year lagged lagged hour holiday afternoon working hour working day month start quarter start trend figure : feature importances, summary hours) and distant values . naturally, the sine and cosine transformed values of cyclical features were also treated together. the maximum mean decrease accuracies are reported for these grouped variables. recent lagged values constitute the most important group of variables. they are especially important for the value forecasts . seasonal variables also seem to play an important role intraday features like the hour of day, afternoon or working hour got large importance scores. the trend variable does not seem to have that much importance, though it was evident during model building attempts that it can add to the rnns forecasting capability. variable importances were pretty similar for the lstm and gru networks. we can hardly see any disagreements in the feature rankings.","The dataset used for bike rental prediction in Washington, D.C. is on an hourly basis.

"several measures of forecast accuracy and directional accuracy were computed on both evaluation sets. mse, smape, r, mae and medae measure the forecasts t, while accuracy, f, precision and recall evaluate the quality of the forecasts changes of direction. most of these evaluation metrics were computed using scikit-learn . the results of the regression evaluations are available in table and table table and table show the change-of-direction binary metrics for the test set. confusion matrices of the directional predictions are displayed in figure and figure the notations for the tables are the following: b bagged estimator; i indi- vidual estimators; v bootstrap left-out validation set; t future test set; o one-step forecasts; m multi-step forecasts. rmse mae smape r medae v-b-o v-i-o t-b-o t-b-m t-i-o t-i-m table : regression evaluation metrics rmse mae smape r medae v-b-o v-i-o t-b-o t-b-m t-i-o t-i-m table : regression evaluation metrics multi-step forecasts have consistently higher errors than the one-step-ahead predictions. it is not surprising just consider the accumulating errors of the iterative forecasting procedure. lagged values of the target variable proved to be important predictors, especially for forecasting values, rather than just di- rections. hence, the accuracy of values that we predict and reuse as inputs, matters a lot. and anyway, the distant future obviously holds much more un- certainty, than the next timestep. all r values are close to for the single-step predictions, and are around for the multi-step predictions. the multi-step rmse is about twice as large as the one-step. the directional accuracies are roughly % for the one-step, while around % for the multi-step forecasts. for multiple steps, the direction of change forecasts seem to work somewhat better than the value forecasts. we have averaged the resulting estimates from all bootstrap samples, and used the averages as our nal predictions we used bagging. by comparing the performance of the bagged estimator to the averaged performance of individual estimators, we might evaluate the usefulness of this ensemble method for recur- rent neural networks. the bagged estimators produced consistently better results than the individual neural networks. this is true for the regression and the classication problem as well. thus, it seems that bagging can improve rnn-predictions. accuracy precision recall f b-o b-m i-o i-m table : classication evaluation metrics accuracy precision recall f b-o b-m i-o i-m table : classication evaluation metrics down up predicted down up true one-step, lstm down up predicted down up true multi-step, lstm down up predicted down up true one-step, gru down up predicted down up true multi-step, gru figure : confusion matrices down up predicted down up true one-step, lstm down up predicted down up true multi-step, lstm down up predicted down up true one-step, gru down up predicted down up true multi-step, gru figure : confusion matrices the gru and the lstm networks are quite close to each other in terms of fore- casting performance. the two networks seem to produce very similar forecasts. papadopoulos et al. found that the bootstrap consistently overestimates prediction interval coverage. it seems to be conrmed by our results, since all of our prediction intervals have a higher coverage than the targeted %. our residual predictor neural network could probably have been further optimized, in order to generate intervals closer to the desired coverage. cwcs was set to ., since we aim to generate % prediction intervals. was set to the arbitrary value of the cwc metrics suggest that the prediction intervals of one-step forecasts are better. it is hardly surprising, since the multi-step forecasts reached similar coverage by producing much wider intervals. the coverage of our prediction intervals exceeds the desired level of % in each case, so cwc equals nmpiw. the prediction intervals evaluation metrics are available in tables and picp mpiw nmpiw cwc v-o v-m t-o t-m table : pi evaluation metrics picp mpiw nmpiw cwc v-o v-m t-o t-m table : pi evaluation metrics","Various evaluation metrics were computed to assess forecast accuracy and directional accuracy on two evaluation sets.

"this study aimed to explore and describe several aspects of the application of recurrent neural networks to time series forecasting, though it is by far not com- prehensive. recurrent neural networks are much more exible and much better suited to time series forecasting than the linear models usually applied. yet, several prac- tices might help their application, some of which have been presented in this article. we may do time series analysis with the aim of either forecasting future values or understanding the processes driving the time series. neural networks are particularly bad in the latter. feature importance measures solve this problem partly. we computed permutation importance scores . the target variables lagged values were the most important predictors in our empirical experiment. seasonality features also seemed important. another shortcoming of neural networks is the lack of prediction condence measures. interval forecasts can be useful for quantifying uncertainty, though producing them for neural networks is nontrivial. bootstrapping is a simple, yet computationally expensive method that can do it. however, it produced pis with consistently higher coverage than what we targeted. multiple-step forecasts generated higher errors than single-step forecasts, as ex- pected. the gaps between the errors seemed smaller in case of direction of change predictions. we found that recurrent neural networks can benet from bagging. the lstm and gru networks showed about the same forecasting performance. it is hard to argue for either of them. this forecasting framework might be enhanced in several ways. during the training process, the states of the lstm/gru cells were reset in each batch, so the dependencies between sequences in dierent batches were not taken into account. we would expect higher accuracies if we took advantage of these relationships in the dataset, though it was dicult with our bootstrapping framework. our iterative method is probably not the best solution for making multi-step forecasts. a sequence to sequence learning model (e.g., cho et al. , sutskever et al. ) might be a better choice. we could have constructed further input features. feature engineering is cru- cial, and there is always room for improvement. though neural networks are very exible, so it didnt seem so necessary. feature importances were only computed for one-step forecasts. it would be worth exploring, if dierent forecasting horizons require dierent features to make high quality forecasts. other measures of variable importance could also be applied. feature importances are only a tiny step towards understanding recurrent neu- ral networks. the mechanism of rnn cells could and should be explored in much more depth. bootstrapping is computationally intensive, but with todays ever improving gpus, it is a feasible algorithm for time series datasets of manageable size. yet, it is a brute force method, so smarter solutions would be welcome. there are several hyperparameters to optimize it is also a disadvantage of neural networks. in this article, we did not aim to nd the best parameters. grid search, or rather random search could have helped in nding the ideal settings. the size of real world datasets hinders deep learning methods in the eld of time series forecasting. if our variable of interest were only observed quarterly or yearly, we would have to wait several lifetimes to acquire a reason- able amount of data. even this -year hourly bike sharing dataset was way too small to exploit the capabilities of a neural network. it would be very useful if we could train an algorithm on multiple similar datasets and gather some collective knowledge that could be used to make better forecasts for the indi- vidual time series. this process of gaining knowledge and applying it to solve dierent problems is called transfer learning. it is already commonly used in, for example, computer vision . transfer learning is most useful when the training data is scarce, so applying it to time series forecasting seems very promising. there is so much left to be done. rnns clearly deserve a seat in the toolbox of time series forecasting. references paul werbos. beyond regression: new tools for prediction and analysis in the behavioral sciences. ph. d. dissertation, harvard university, paul j

"the asymptotic giant branch is a post-main sequence stage in the stellar evolution of low- to intermediate-mass stars with masses in the range m(herwig ; h ofner & olofsson , and references therein). the agb phase is characterised by vigorous mass loss, with ejected matter forming an expanding circumstellar envelope . molecules and dust grains form in the circumstellar enve- lope and are eventually returned to the interstellar medium . in this way, agb stars are a signicant source of chemical enrichment of the ism and contribute to the chem- ical evolution of galaxies (romano et al. ; kobayashi et al. ; prantzos et al. ). the chemical composition of the cse depends on the chemical type of the agb star, which is often assigned e-mail: taissa.danilovich@kuleuven.be postdoctoral fellow of the fund for scientic research , flanders, belgium through optical spectral classication. the primary spec- tral classications are based on the c/o ratio which in turn plays a key role in determining the chemical characteristics of the cse. oxygen-rich agb stars, which have c/o < , are the most common. stars arrive on the agb oxygen rich and over time carbon (and other nucleosynthesis prod- ucts) may be dredged up from the interior and lead to an increase in the surface c/o and hence a shift in the chem- ical properties of the cse. some agb stars may become carbon-rich over time with c/o > (and are believed to pass through the transitionary phase of s-type stars with c/o ), while others are massive enough to experience hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope; this process provokes the destruction of the surface carbon, leaving the stars oxygen-rich (renzini & voli ; bloecker & schoenberner ; boothroyd & sackmann , ; lattanzio ). for a review on agb evolution and nu- cleosynthesis including hbb models we refer to karakas & lattanzio . the authors arxiv:v jan t. danilovich et al. sulphur is not synthesised in agb stars nor in their main sequence progenitors. this allows us to constrain the study of sulphur-bearing molecules in agb cses since the total abundance of sulphur can be estimated (usually based on solar abundance when considering nearby stars) and does not change signicantly over time, since it is not thought to be depleted onto dust (waelkens et al. ; reyniers & van winckel ). sulphur is also the tenth most abundant element in the universe, meaning that when a signicant portion is locked up in particular molecules, they are rel- atively easy to detect in observations. the most common sulphur-bearing molecules found in agb cses are cs, sis, so, so and hs. these have been most commonly studied using spatially unresolved observations of rotational transi- tion lines, for example by danilovich et al. for hs. in a study focussing on cs and sis, danilovich et al. surveyed a sample of agb stars covering a range of mass-loss rates and chemical types. they detected cs in all surveyed carbon stars, some of the s-type stars and the highest mass-loss rate m-type stars. sis was only detected in the highest mass-loss rate sources across chemical types. the sensitivity of their observations and subsequently cal- culated upper limits were insucient to determine whether the high mass-loss rate m-type agb stars genuinely have higher abundances of cs and sis than the low mass-loss rate m-type agb stars. more sensitive observations were required to conclusively make that determination. such sen- sitive observations are possible with telescopes such as the atacama large millimetre/sub-millimetre array , which, with its high spatial resolution, also allows us to accu- rately map the distribution of circumstellar emission. for ex- ample, brunner et al. recently presented alma maps and radiative transfer models of several molecular species to- wards the s-type agb star w aql, including cs, sis and sis for which they were able to accurately determine the radial abundance distributions. to check the abundances of cs and sis in lower mass- loss rate m-type stars, we must look to the available sensitive alma observations of such stars. two of the closest agb stars are r dor and w hya, which are both oxygen-rich and have low mass-loss rates of myr for r dor and myr for w hya . the most signicant dierence be- tween w hya and r dor is that the former is a mira variable while the latter is a semi-regular variable of type b . both have been subject to apex observations which did not detect cs or sis for r dor and danilovich et al. for w hya). their proximity makes them ideal to search for weak cs and sis emission in alma observations. detected emission lines from these molecules will allow us to determine abundances, while non- detections will allow us to place more stringent upper limits on their abundances. both r dor and w hya have recently been observed by alma, as detailed in sect. also observed was ik tau, a higher mass-loss rate agb star losing myr . cs and sis emission was detected towards ik tau by apex and analysed in danilovich et al. . the spatially-resolved alma observations of these molecules will allow us to precisely determine their radial abundance distributions and hence compare these with the modelling results of danilovich et al. , which are based on single-dish observations. this will enable us to check the reliability of the empirical formulae found by danilovich et al. for nding cs and sis e-folding radii, and to compare the similarly determined abundance distributions with those for the low mass-loss rate stars. hence, in this study we will analyse the spatial distri- bution of cs and sis detected with alma towards ik tau, w hya, and r dor. using radiative transfer modelling, we will compare precisely determined abundance distributions with previously obtained results.","The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is a crucial stage in the evolution of low- to intermediate-mass stars, characterized by vigorous mass loss and the formation of circumstellar envelopes containing molecules and dust grains. AGB stars play a significant role in the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium and Galaxy evolution. The chemical composition of the circumstellar envelope depends on the type of AGB star, classified based on the C/O ratio. Oxygen-rich AGB stars are the most common, but some may become carbon-rich over time. Sulphur-bearing molecules, such as CS and SiS, are commonly found in AGB circumstellar envelopes and are relatively easy to detect in observations. Recent studies have focused on detecting these molecules in AGB stars with varying mass-loss rates and chemical types, using advanced telescopes like the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). Spatially resolved observations and radiative transfer models allow for the precise determination of radial abundance distributions of these molecules, providing insights into the chemical properties of AGB stars."

ALMA observations revealed multiple isotopologues of SiS and vibrationally excited lines. Comparison with APEX observations showed no flux resolved out in the ALMA data. For CS, ALMA detected both the main isotopologue and a weak transition, with differences observed in the peak emission distribution indicating varying abundance levels near the star.

A similar approach is taken to detect the main CS line in R Dor, with success in both cases. By using these detections and tentative non-detections at smaller radii, models for SiS and CS around O-rich AGB stars like R Dor are constrained. Comparison of ALMA observations of CS and SiS towards IK Tau shows variations in detections based on extraction radii."
"modelling procedure we use a one-dimensional, spherically symmetric model to approximate the molecular emission of cs and sis. although this precludes the inclusion of asymmetric structures, we are still able to approximate the overall shape of the emission based on the average radial proles calculated from the ze- roth moment maps, and hence take into account various ra- dial abundances and mean densities. the modelling is done using an accelerated lambda iter- ation method which has been used to model a variety of molecular emission in the past, including both cs and sis . where possible we have included previously observed single-dish observa- tions to add constraints to our models (see danilovich et al. , for details on these archival observations). to compare our models with the azimuthally averaged alma radial pro- les, we extracted synthetic radial proles from our models and plotted them against the alma proles. the models were adjusted until the best t to the data was found. in the case where emission was too weak to extract a radial prole from the observations such as in the case of r dor and some of the weaker isotopologue lines towards ik tau the models were based solely on the extracted spectra. table stellar properties and input from co models. parameters ik tau r dor w hya luminosity distance t m exp notes: tis the stellar temperature derived from sed tting; m is the mass-loss rate; exp is the gas expansion velocity.","The text describes the use of a one-dimensional, spherically symmetric model in radiative transfer modeling to approximate the molecular emission of CS and SiS.

"the crucial stellar and circumstellar parameters that go into our radiative transfer models are listed in table all parameters are taken from danilovich et al. and the references therein. we note that the eective temperatures reported in table , which are derived from sed tting, are signicantly cooler than stellar evolution models predict. however, a full examination of this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper. we used molecular data for sis that was previously implemented by danilovich et al. : rotational energy levels from j = to j = in the ground and rst excited vibrational states with parameters taken from the jpl spec- troscopic database and the v = col- lisional rates for sis-h are scaled from the sio-he rates of dayou & balan ca . this set of energy levels is shown in red in fig. for the isotopologues, the same quantum num- bered set of energy levels and identical collisional rates were used (since scaling for the dierence in mass is negligible in these cases). the energy levels and radiative transition pa- rameters for the isotopologues were taken from the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy (cdms, m uller et al. ; endres et al. ) for sis, sis, and sis and from exomol for sis, sis, and sis. to facilitate the v = lines that were detected for the main isotopologue towards ik tau we created an ex- panded sis data le from the molecular data available via cdms (m uller et al. ). this expanded le included ro- tational energy levels from j = to j = and vibrational levels v = , , , with the levels linked by all the relevant vibrational transitions. this expanded set of energy lev- els is shown in fig. . the same set of collisional rates, covering only levels j in the ground vibrational state, were used since no vibrationally excited collisional rates are available. since the v = lines were not detected for the less abundant isotopologues, we only use such an expanded molecular description for sis. for cs we also used the molecular data implemented note that exp, obtained from tting co spectra from single- dish observations, is the input parameter required to reproduce bulk of the line emission. it is not directly related to the higher velocities observed in the wings of various r dor and ik tau emission lines by decin et al. . https://spec.jpl.nasa.gov http://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/cdms http://exomol.com mnras , t. danilovich et al. figure the channel maps of the cs transition at ghz for ik tau, which has lsr = km s the black contours show % and % levels of the ik tau continuum emission. the beam is indicated in white in the lower left corner of each channel. by danilovich et al. : rotational energy levels from j = to j = in the ground and rst excited vibrational states were included with parameters taken from cdms, and collisional rates based on those for co-h computed by yang et al. were used. for the isotopologue model of cs we used energy levels and transitions for the same set of quantum states, also taken from cdms, and the same set of collisional rates as for the main cs isotopologue. mnras , alma view of cs and sis around o-rich agb stars figure the channel maps of the sis transition at ghz for w hya, which has lsr = km s the black contours show % of the peak w hya continuum emission. the beam is indicated in white in the lower left corner of each channel. figure the channel maps of the cs transition at ghz for w hya, which has lsr = km s the black contours show % of the peak w hya continuum emission. the beam is indicated in white in the lower left corner of each channel. mnras , t. danilovich et al. v energy figure sis energy level diagram showing all the levels with v = , , and j included in the expanded molecular description . levels highlighted in red are those with v = , and j included in the basic sis molecular description.","Input parameters for radiative transfer models include stellar and circumstellar parameters listed in a table.

". sis for sis towards ik tau, we were able to nd a model that ts the data well using a gaussian radial prole to describe the abundance stratication throughout the cse. since we also had access to several single-dish observations of sis (for details see danilovich et al. ), we used these along with the alma spectra and radial prole to con- strain the model. the best tting model found when only including the v = , vibrational states has an inner frac- tional abundance relative to h f = at an inner radius of cm and an e-folding ra- dius re = cm. the uncertainties calculated are based on a % condence interval. we experimented with smaller inner radii, but those models all signicantly over-predicted the ux for the inner regions of the cse. the nal inner radius of cm is that used by danilovich et al. for the so and so models of ik tau and is in agreement with the radius used by maercker et al. for co and ho. the abundance prole of our nal sis model is plotted in fig. along with

inverted triangles shows the radial prole obtained for the expanded molecular description when neglecting collisions. the error bars shown on the alma data are as described in sect. . with the expanded molecular description gives a very similar result with the main dierences being a reduc- tion in intensity of the innermost radial prole point and bet- ter agreement with observations for the v = lines. this is expected since the availability of higher energy levels would have a more signicant impact on the higher energy regions. the radial prole of the transition for this model is also plotted in fig. and the corresponding model lines for both molecular descriptions are plotted with single-dish observations and alma spectra in fig. we also tested the signicance of the collisional rates by running another model with the same abundance pro- le but this time using the expanded molecular description with all collisional rates set to zero eec- tively neglecting collisions. the result was again similar to the existing results with the only signicant deviation being, again, in the innermost part of the radial prole. very little change was seen in the outer parts of the radial prole and in the single dish observations. these changes make sense if we consider that collisions are expected to play a more signicant role in the dense inner regions of the cse. to determine the abundances of the sis isotopologues, we used the same e-folding radius of cm that was found for sis and varied the peak abundance until the best t to the alma radial prole was found. our models were equally weighted between the spectral lines extracted from the alma data and the radial proles out to , beyond which noise and instrumental eects made the data unreliable. for the two weakest isotopologues, sis and sis, only the spectra were used since the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations was too low to extract a radial prole. the resultant isotopologue abundances are listed in

trace the same isotopic ratios, suggesting that sis isotopologues are good tracers of si and s isotopic ratios. the only exception was sis for which we found a higher abundance than expected. the alma spectra of sis are both brighter and wider than those of sis, which is unexpected since we otherwise obtain higher abundances of molecules with si than si . the discrep- ancy is most likely due to the sis line at ghz being contaminated by an unidentied blend. excluding this line, the means of the isotopic ratios found are listed in table and compared with solar and literature values. . cs we initially assumed a gaussian abundance distribution for cs in the cse of ik tau, starting from the same in- ner radius as for sis. however, this strongly overpredicted the central brightness despite tting the outer parts of the emission. hence, we adjusted the radial abundance distribu- tion so that there was a lower-abundance inner component with abundance fc, out to a radius rc, outside of which the original gaussian abundance distribution was used. we found the model that best ts the alma radial prole had two stratied inner components, with fc = , rc = cm, fc = , rc = cm, and beyond rc a gaussian component with f = and re = cm. the radial prole from this model for the cs transition is shown with the alma azimuthally averaged prole in fig. the derived abundance prole is shown in fig. where it is compared with the radial prole found by danilovich et al. from tting only single- dish cs data. the observations of cs have a low signal-to- noise ratio. it also seems that some of the extended ux has been resolved out, based on some negative ux around in the radial prole. hence, we were unable to t a model based purely on the observations. instead we use a model with the same abundance structure as for cs and, taking the s/s ratio found from sis, we nd the cs observations to be in good agreement to the sulphur isotopic ratio found for sis.","A model was developed to analyze observations of Sulfur Monosulfide (SiS) towards the star IK Tau, using both ALMA and single-dish data. The model included a Gaussian abundance profile to describe the abundance stratification. Different molecular descriptions were tested, including variations in collisional rates and isotopologue abundances. The results showed good agreement with observations for SiS isotopologues. For Carbonyl sulfide (CS), a model with stratified inner components was found to best fit the data. The study also compared isotopic ratios with solar and literature values. Overall, the modeling results provided valuable insights into the chemical composition around the O-rich AGB star IK Tau."

". sis since we do not have a radial prole for sis towards r dor, due to the very faint emission of this transition, we are unable to precisely constrain the size of the sis emitting envelope. the e-folding radius for a gaussian distribution predicted by the sis formula calculated in danilovich et al. gives re = cm which is only about six stellar radii . this formula is calculated from only high mass- loss rate sources and may not hold for low mass-loss rates. running a model with this re did not t the data well, even when we tried adjusting the inner radius. adjusting the re to nd a t to our observations, we found that we could not properly constrain the model for re larger than cm. this is mostly due to the reduced signal-to-noise of the observations when extracting spectra for apertures with radii larger than hence we use re = cm. we also tested dierent inner radii: rin = rin analogy with the w hya results, rin = cm from the modelling of maercker et al. and rin = cm from the modelling of danilovich et al. . our model results signicantly over-predicted the inner emission for the two smaller radii, so we use rin = cm in our nal model. in all model test cases we vary the peak central abun- dance, f, in increments of until the resultant emission lines best match the observed emission lines. for the best model we found f = relative to h the resultant models are plotted with the observed spectra in fig. and the radial abundance distribution of the model is plotted in fig. . cs for r dor we use a similar procedure for cs as for sis, bas- ing our model on the alma

limitations of the data, we cannot constrain the e-folding ra- dius further. as for sis, we tested three inner radii: rin = r, cm, and cm. although our observations are not sensitive enough to

although our model reproduces the general shape of the lines well, there is an oset of km s between the ob- served absorption feature and the modelled absorption fea- ture in the smallest extraction region spectrum. this is not due to an inaccurate lsr velocity since the spectral line from the largest extraction region is well-aligned with the model line. it can be accounted for if we consider the rotat- ing disc around r dor proposed by homan et al. . in a spherical expanding envelope, which is perforce what our d code models, we expect the absorption feature to be located between, lsr min, where min is the minimum expansion velocity (generally taken to be the speed of sound close to the star, km s), and exp. this is indeed what we see in the case of w hya, where the modelled location of the absorption feature agrees well with the observation. in the case of a rotating disc around r dor, however, we expect some of the gas in the direct line of sight to the star to have a radial velocity of zero with respect to the lsr velocity, since it is instead moving laterally, assuming that the disc is edge-on or close to edge-on. hence, the absorption fea- ture would be found closer to lsr as is, indeed, seen in our observations. similar arguments can be used in the case of stellar rotation causing a velocity eld in the regions close to the stellar surface as suggested by vlemmings et al. and our observations do not rule out either scenario.","The section discusses model results for the R Dor star, focusing on the emission of Sulfur Monoxide (SO) and Carbon Monosulfide (CS). Due to limitations in observational data, the size of the emitting envelope for SO could not be precisely determined. Various models were tested, with adjustments made to parameters such as inner radius and central abundance to match the observed emission lines. For CS, a similar approach was taken, leading to the determination of the best-fitting model parameters. Discrepancies between observed and modelled absorption features were attributed to factors such as the possible presence of a rotating disc around the star. The models generally reproduced the line shapes well, with some adjustments needed to account for specific velocity effects."
"dierence between lower and higher mass-loss rate stars in fig. we have plotted the radial abundance distribu- tions derived for all three stars in our sample, grouped by molecule. for both sis and cs, we see a progression in abundance from r dor to w hya to ik tau. this offset integrated intensity cs model alma figure top: the best cs model radial prole (red squares and solid line) plotted with the alma azimuthally averaged ra- dial prole of the transi- tion for w hya. the error bars shown on the alma data are as described in sect. . bottom: the observed spectra (black histograms) and model line proles for cs towards w hya, including an undetected observation from apex. the sizes of the extraction radii for the alma spectra are listed in the top right corners. is unexpected if we assume that the abundances of either of these molecules is solely dependent on the mass-loss rate ( m) or wind density ( m/exp); while ik tau has the high- est wind density, around an order of magnitude higher than that of r dor, w hyas wind density is about a factor of two smaller than r dors. this strongly implies that an- other factor is at play, even if, as suggested by the results of danilovich et al. , density may contribute to the presence of sis and cs . in this section we discuss some of the factors that may be at play, including density, elemental abundances, clumping and pulsation types. sis is thought to form in denser environments , although in general sis chemistry is currently not very well characterised. we note that sis was not detected towards any of the semi-regular variables mnras , alma view of cs and sis around o-rich agb stars flux sis r dor alma mas velocity sis r dor alma mas velocity flux sis r dor alma "" figure r dor sis model and observed spectrum . the sizes of the extraction radii for the alma spectra are listed in the top right corners. radius fractional abundance sis cs radius figure the abundance distributions derived from modelling the r dor observations of cs and sis. included in the study of danilovich et al. , including two of the carbon stars the rest of which generally had higher sis abundances than the oxygen-rich stars. there is ample evidence that signicantly lower sis abundances are found for both lower mass-loss rates and less extreme pulsators. for example, sch oier et al. also did not detect sis in any semi-regular stars except for rw lmi, a sra with a long period and a v-band amplitude of mag, which is in the mira variable range. rw lmi is also the only sr star with an sis detection in the survey of bujarrabal et al. ; the rest are all miras. this suggests that sis forms more readily and reaches higher abundances in the environments of mira variable cses rather than in the cses of semi-regular variables. since semi-regular vari- ables are characterised by smaller amplitudes ( mag in the v band), while miras are characterised by larger ampli- figure r dor cs model and observed spectrum . the sizes of the extraction radii for the alma spectra are listed in the top right corners. tudes and regular periods, the amplitude could have an impact on sis formation. the tentative correlation between sis abundance and pulsation amplitude that we see in this present study could be due to shocks, as with cs, but earlier studies suggest that it may hold across chemical types (the study of sch oier et al. included carbon stars and those of danilovich et al. and bujarrabal et al. included carbon and s- type stars), while the shock-induced formation of cs is most relevant to oxygen-rich stars. we also consider the sulphur and silicon budgets, since these two elements are not nucleosynthesised in agb stars nor their main sequence progenitors. assuming a solar abun- dance of both elements , past studies have shown that the sulphur budget of r dor can be almost entirely accounted for by so and so (danilovich et al. ), while the silicon budget is similarly accounted for by sio , not leaving much scope for the formation of sis (note that the carbon budget is more complicated and cannot readily be estimated from the solar abundance of carbon). the same results are found for w hya by khouri et al. for si and danilovich et al. for s, which is consistent with our results here; the amount of si and s accounted for by our sis and cs models is neg- ligible compared with the sio, so, and so abundances in these low mass-loss rate stars. ik tau diers from the other two stars in many ways. the so and so abundances found by danilovich et al. are roughly an order of magni- tude lower than for r dor and w hya and are comparable to the sis abundance we nd here. the sio abundance found by decin et al. is also around an order of magnitude lower than the sio abundances of r dor and w hya and, while this could account for the increased sis abundance (as discussed by danilovich et al. ), there remains plenty of silicon outside of these two molecules possibly having condensed into dust. it is also possible that a clumpy circumstellar medium accounts for some of the dierences we see between the stars mnras , t. danilovich et al. radius fractional abundance sis ik tau w hya r dor radius fractional abundance cs ik tau w hya r dor figure sis abundances and cs abundances for all three modelled stars. the vertical lines are the inner radii of the corresponding models. in our sample. for example, van de sande et al. show that clumpy outows can produce a signicant amount of cs. various channel maps of other molecules towards r dor show arc-like structures in the cse rather than a smooth outow, indicating a level of clumpi- ness in the outow. for the cs emission in ik tau the posi- tion of the abundance increase can be explained by a clumpy outow, as shown by van de sande et al. , whereas the smooth outow models of willacy & millar give a cs increase further out in the envelope (between and cm) which does not agree with our results. another source of dierences between the stars could be the pulsation types. consider the fact that r dor is a srb variable with at least two pulsation modes (bedding et al. ), while w hya and ik tau are mira variables (pojman- ski ; wo zniak et al. ). some variability properties of these stars, taken from the aforementioned citations and the vsx database are given in table , including period and variations in v magnitude . from this we can see that both period and amplitude increase with the progression from r dor to w hya to ik tau. cs is not a species pre- dicted to form in oxygen-rich environments when only equi- librium chemistry is considered , whereas it is expected to be form easily in carbon-rich environments. in oxygen-rich cses it is thought that shocks play a signif- icant role in cs formation (see cherchne; gobrecht et al. ; danilovich et al. , for further discussion), hence it follows logically that more cs would form in stars with more extreme pulsations. aside from the dierences in abundances, our results also show dierences in the inner radii of the models. our ik tau models have a larger inner radius , while the w hya models start close to the stellar surface. thanks to the high spatial resolution of the alma data, we are reasonably condent that this is a real dierence between the stars (though we are less certain about the r dor inner international variable star index database, www.aavso.org/ vsx/ table variability properties of studied stars star v period type ik tau mira w hya mira r dor , srb values taken from the vsx database. radii results). we tested models with smaller inner radii for ik tau and, although little dierence is apparent in the models for the apex data, there is a noticeable dierence in the models for the resolved alma lines and in the radial prole. if anything, the alma data points towards a slightly larger inner radius . this was not the case for w hya, for which we found the best agreement with an abundance prole that starts from the innermost regions close to the star. this dichotomy could point to the eects of dust formation in these cses. if more silicate dust is formed in ik tau, the production of sis at a larger radius in ik tau than in w hya could be due to sputtering dust grains making si available for sis formation. this theory is supported by the inner radius of our ik tau sis model lying close to where dust has formed in the cse (decin et al. ), and by the fact that using a smaller inner radius for our model did not agree with the observations. the question that remains is: why are such dierent pro- portions of the sulphur molecules present in these oxygen- rich stars? is it a case of evolutionary change are the dierences due to the diering ages of the stars? if that is the case, then what drives the change over time? is it due to dust formation or dust-gas chemistry or other physical changes in the cse? or is another factor at play?","The discussion section analyzes the differences in abundance distributions of various molecules in lower and higher mass-loss rate stars, specifically focusing on the stars R Dor, W Hya, and IK Tau. The study reveals unexpected offsets in integrated intensity and abundance progression not solely dependent on mass-loss rate or wind density. Various factors are considered, including densities, elemental abundances, clumping, and pulsation types. More sulfur and silicon are accounted for in the oxygen-rich stars than in the carbon molecules studied (CS and SiS). Clumpy circumstellar environments and different pulsation types are suggested as possible reasons for the differences observed. The effects of dust formation and dust-gas chemistry on molecular compositions in the stars are also explored. The study questions the reasons behind the varying proportions of sulfur molecules in these oxygen-rich stars, considering factors such as evolutionary changes and physical changes in the circumstellar environment."
"danilovich et al. observed cs and sis lines using apex and iram for a large sample of agb stars, includ- ing ik tau and w hya, the latter of which did not yield mnras , alma view of cs and sis around o-rich agb stars any detected lines. based on these observations and radia- tive transfer modelling, they derived empirical formulae for the e-folding radii of both molecules based on mass-loss rate and terminal expansion velocity. using these formulae, they also found upper limits for w hya based on their apex non-detections, which we plot with our alma results in fig. as can be seen there, both upper limits assumed inner radii of cm and both gave higher fractional abun- dances than we derive from the alma data. for cs, the e-folding radius predicted by the formula is in good agree- ment with the radius we found in the gaussian part of our model and the peak fractional abundance was only a little higher than the peak abundance for the gaussian part of our model. the inner regions of our model stretch to the stellar surface and were found to be signicantly lower than the upper limit model. there is a more signicant dierence between their sis upper limit and our model, however. the e-folding radius predicted by their formula is an order of magnitude smaller than what we found based on the alma data and our peak fractional abundance is an order of magnitude lower than the upper limit they found based on the apex observations. this suggests that the sis e-folding radius formula found by danilovich et al. does not hold for low mass-loss rate stars. in the case of ik tau, the model calculated by danilovich et al. for sis was in agreement with our more precise alma results to within a factor of for both peak fractional abundance and e-folding radius. for cs we found a less regular distribution of cs than was appar- ent from the single dish observations and hence our model deviates from that found by danilovich et al. more signicantly: the gaussian portion of our model has an e- folding radius a factor of smaller and our peak fractional abundance is a factor of larger. ik tau has been the subject of other single-dish studies of these two molecules. sch oier et al. surveyed sis in a large sample carbon- and oxygen-rich agb stars and mod- elled the sis emission. they assumed e-folding radii for sis based on the empirical result derived by gonz alez delgado et al. for sio, giving an e-folding radius for ik tau of cm, almost three times larger than ours. to nd adequate ts to their observations, they also implemented a compact central component of sis out to cm with a high sis abundance of in this region. we do not see such a compact inner region in our alma observations, which are certainly sensitive enough to detect the kind of jump in abundance they used. decin et al. modelled several dierent molecular species towards ik tau, including sis and cs. they imple- mented a similar sis model to sch oier et al. , with a more abundant inner component and a lower abundance outer component, the latter being much larger than the size of our sis radial abundance distribution. their inner abun- dance is also larger than ours, exceeding it by more than a factor of three. their cs model gives a dierent radial abundance prole to ours, with a constant inner abundance paired with a rise and decline in the outer regions. their fractional abundance is much smaller than what we found in the outer regions of our model, although it agrees well with the innermost abundance we found. decin et al. also calculated isotopic ratios for si from sio observations. their results agree with ours within the specied errors and they included a literature review and discussion of si iso- topic ratios in their sect. , to which we direct interested readers. velilla prieto et al. performed a line survey of ik tau using the iram m telescope and detected lines across molecular species. they also calculated si and s isotopic ratios based on their observations of sio, sis, cs, so, and so and on abundances they derived from popula- tion diagrams. the abundances they found for sis and cs are within % and %, respectively, of our results. however their abundances of the less common isotopologues of these molecules are factors of higher than our results. hence their isotopologue ratios are not in agreement with ours. they nd s/s = from cs and sis (and lower values from so and so), which is signicantly lower than our value of for si/si calculated from sis, they nd , which is also much smaller than our value of for si/si, also calculated from sis, they nd , less than half of our value of peng et al. observed the less abundant isotopo- logues of sio and hence calculated the si/si ratio for a sample of stars, including ik tau. they found a ratio of , in good agreement with our result of . brunner et al. modelled several molecules ob- served by alma towards the s-type agb star w aql, in- cluding cs, sis and sis. their observations are of lower spatial resolution than ours and no deviations from gaussian abundance proles can be seen in the inner regions of their observations. they do nd the need to include an overden- sity in their models at around cm from the centre of the star, but this is assumed to be due to spiral windings seen more clearly in the co alma observations of w aql pre- sented by ramstedt et al. . overdensity aside, their gaussian sis abundance prole is similar to what we found for ik tau suggesting that the molecule may behave sim- ilarly in the circumstellar envelopes of these chemically dif- ferent stars with similar mass-loss rates. they found a higher abundance of cs, however, which is not surprising given that w aql is an s-type star with a higher abundance of c than is present around ik tau, an oxygen-rich star. they found a much lower sis/sis ratio of for w aql than we found for ik tau and a much lower si/si ratio of compared with our ratio of these ratios are indicative of w aql having a higher metallicity than ik tau does (see, for example, the model results of kobayashi et al. ). the si/si ratio for w aql, derived by brunner et al. by combining sio and sis observations, is also smaller than what we nd for ik tau, with for w aql compared with for ik tau. since we do not expect the si/si ratio to change much with metallicity (kobayashi et al. ), this could be a result of inhomogeneous chemical evolution of the galaxy rather than a tracer of metallicity. isotopologue ratios and galactic chemical evolution in table , we compare our calculated ik tau isotopic ratios with literature values for r dor and w hya and the solar isotope ratios from asplund et al. . our ik tau values are generally larger than the solar values and the r dor val- ues from the literature (danilovich et al. ; de beck & mnras , t. danilovich et al. olofsson ). since we have used the convention of always writing the ratios as lower mass number over higher mass number, this means that we found ik tau to have a lower proportion of heavier isotopes than the sun and r dor. this dierence is most noticeable when comparing rarer isotopo- logues to the most common isotopologue, while the ratios between the less common isotopes are in good agreement with the solar values. for silicon, our si/si and si/si ratios are close to % higher than the solar value, and for sulphur our s/s ratio is about % higher than the so- lar value and the s/s ratio is almost % higher. our si/si ratio is only % higher than the solar value while s/s ratio is within % of the solar value. the general trend suggests that ik tau has a lower metallicity than the sun . conversely, the literature data suggests r dor may have a slightly higher metallicity than the sun when considering the si isotopes, although the dierence is less pronounced (and the s/s ratio is in good agreement with the solar value). si, s, and s are produced through oxygen burn- ing and in type ii supernovae through explosive nucleosynthesis (anders & grevesse ; hughes et al. ). the less abundant isotopes of si and si are formed through neon burning and neutron capture in sne ii and may increase in abundance during the agb phase through slow neutron captures . s is partly also formed from neutron captures via s, which means its abundance may increase in agb stars . however, in the models of karakas & lugaro , the s/s and s/s ratios do not change much over the course of agb evolution, suggesting that these can be readily used to trace galactic chemical evo- lution. for the most extreme example of a low-mass agb star, a star with a main sequence mass mand metal- licity z = that becomes carbon-rich and experiences considerable dredge up will only have a shift of % in s/s and a shift of % in s/s while on the ther- mally pulsing agb. karakas & lugaro predict that the s/s ratio does change more signicantly due to neu- tron captures in the he-shell. we did not detect sis in the alma scan and cs falls outside of the observed fre- quency range. (note also that none of the strongest so lines fall within the observed frequency range.) a quick anal- ysis of sis based on our non-detections with alma gives an upper-limit abundance f < relative to h this gives a lower-limit s/s that is about % lower than the solar value. chin et al. nd a gradient in s/s ratio with distance from the galactic centre . however, their observations are of star-forming regions (with s/s ranging from to ) and the solar system value does not lie very close to their trend line. since star-forming regions are in a very dierent evolutionary phase to agb stars , it is unclear that their isotopologue ratios can be directly related to those that we nd for individual stars. aside from the spread in the age-metallicity relationship in the solar neighbourhood , ik tau formed from molecular clouds that signicantly predate present-day star- forming regions and hence are not comparable. overall, our results are in agreement with the conclusions drawn by decin et al. that, based on isotopic ratios, the ism from which ik tau formed was enriched by sne ii (see also zinner et al. ).","Danilovich et al. compared their ALMA observations of CS and SiS around AGB stars with previous studies. They found discrepancies in e-folding radii and fractional abundances of molecules compared to empirical formulae derived by previous studies. Their results indicated that the e-folding radius formula for SiS may not hold for low mass-loss rate stars. Comparison with other studies on IK Tau showed variations in abundance distributions of CS and SiS. Literature comparisons of isotopic ratios revealed that IK Tau has a lower metallicity than the Sun and R Dor, as indicated by Si and S ratios. The study also discussed the origin of isotopes and their relevance for tracing galactic chemical evolution. Additionally, the study did not detect SiS in ALMA scans and found a lower-limit S/S ratio compared to solar values. Overall, the results align with conclusions suggesting enrichment by supernovae II for the ISM from which IK Tau formed."
"we analysed alma observations of sis and cs emission lines for ik tau, w hya, and r dor and were successfully able to use radiative transfer modelling to derive abundance distributions for all three. we found that of the three stars r dor had the lowest abundances for both molecules and ik tau had the highest, with the dierence in peak abun- dance between the two extremes spanning more than two orders of magnitude for sis and dex for cs. for cs to- wards ik tau and both molecules towards w hya, we found stratied abundance distributions. the w hya emission and models also indicates that both of these molecules are found very close to the star, while the ik tau models show these molecules forming further out in the cse of ik tau. we also calculated abundances for several isotopologues detected towards ik tau: cs, sis, sis, sis, sis, sis, and sis. overall the isotopic ratios we derived from these suggest a lower metallicity for ik tau than the solar value. acknowledgements ld, mvds

This architecture maximizes modulation efficiency by enhancing the RF drive signal, optical pump, and optical sideband simultaneously. The design utilizes resonant supermodes of coupled optical resonators for optical enhancement and LC circuits for RF enhancement. Unlike conventional modulators, the proposed design does not face limitations on RF center frequency due to photon lifetime constraints, allowing efficient operation at high RF carrier frequencies. Two optical configurations are presented, one for narrowband RF signals and another for broadening RF bandwidth while maintaining modulation efficiency. The modulator design offers compactness, efficiency, and high-frequency modulation capabilities, promising to enable complex RF-photonic systems on chip."
"microwave photonic systems rely on sensitive electro-optic modulators for various applications such as radio-over-ber, optical beam forming, photonic signal processing, photonic analog-to-digital conversion, satellite-based mm-wave sensing, etc. . the eciency with which the rf signal is converted to the optical domain by an eo modulator is an essential parameter directly aecting the gain of a mwp link. mach-zehnder modulators, both discrete and integrated, have been used in mwp systems over the past decades as the workhorse devices for rf-to-optical conversion. however, these devices are large and power-hungry. integrated photonics technology oers new opportunities for sensitive microresonator-based eo modulators, such as microring and photonic crystal cavity modulators. owing to their resonant nature, these devices are compact and ecient. however, they suer from the speed-sensitivity tradeo, imposed by the cavity photon lifetime . this tradeohas been addressed by using modulation-induced coupling between adjacent free spectral range arxiv:v jan o p p+o p o p+o rf in opt. in opt. out laser pump triply resonant modulator concept opt. in opt. out opt. in opt. out a cm cm l l rf+ in rf- in rm rm cm cm c l l l l c rf+ in rf- in rm rm a cm cm rf+ in rf- in rm rm optical conigurations non-resonant basic generalized rf conigurations resonant resonant-matched o || o || o || figure : conceptual representation of the triply-resonant modulator, consisting of one rf and two optical mutually coupled resonances at frequencies of the three interacting waves: the input rf drive, the input laser pump, and the output optical sideband. physical realization of the two optical resonances by supermodes of the basic coupled-cavity design, with a conven- tional bus waveguide, and the generalized coupled-cavity design, with novel interferometrically coupled input/output waveguides. non-resonant rf design, where the transmission line di- rectly feeds the active optical cavities. due to impedance mismatch between them, rf power is almost completely reected from the load. resonant design, where the rf resonance from is realized by lc circuits, consisting of integrated inductors l and capacitances cm of the active cavities. it greatly reduces rf power reection and enhances the voltage on the active cavities. resonant-matched design, where critical coupling between the transmission line and the rf resonator is achieved using impedance matching circuits which consist of inductors l and capacitors c the plots at the bottom of - sketch the frequency dependence of the power reection || of the rf signal back into the transmission line. modes of millimeter-scale whispering-gallery-mode disk and ring resonator modulators, which have their speed set by the fsr of the resonator , as discussed in more detail below. these devices are inherently large and require implementation of rf traveling wave electrodes. in this work, we present a detailed account of a novel triply resonant modulator consisting of two coupled microresonator-based modulator cavities and lumped rf resonators. the proposed device is compact and energy ecient, similar to conventional microresonator-based modulators. moreover, it does not suer from speed-sensitivity tradeo, since it uses multiple optical resonances, similar to fsr- coupled modulators. additionally, the rf resonance boosts the voltage which further increases the eciency, as described below.","Microwave photonic systems utilize sensitive electro-optic modulators for various applications.

"this work proposes a novel electro-optic modulator for ecient conversion of rf signals into optical domain. the rf signals are assumed to be bandlimited with rf carrier frequency o. an electro- optic modulator can be viewed as a device where the interaction of two waves, the laser pump wave and the rf drive wave, creates a third wave an optical sideband shifted in frequency by o with respect to the laser pump. the goal is to maximize the modulation eciency, dened here as the fraction of the input laser pump power which gets converted into the optical sideband . this work proposes an integrated triply-resonant rf electro-optic modulator, where each of the two optical waves and the rf wave are resonantly enhanced to maximize the modulation eciency. our work is a continuation of that in , and some aspects of this modulator have been recently described in . a conceptual representation of the triply-resonant device is shown in fig. the three rectangles represent the input/output ports of the device, and the three circles represent the three mutually coupled resonances. the rf resonance and one of the optical resonances are excited by the input rf and the laser pump waves, while the other optical resonance is excited by the optical sideband that is generated due to nonlinear interaction between the rf drive and the optical pump within the device. during this interaction, an rf photon combines with a pump photon to produce an optical sideband photon, translating each rf spectral component to the optical domain. the key idea of the proposed device is that the conversion eciency is maximized when all three interacting waves are at resonance, and when their lifetimes/escape eciencies are properly tailored. in the physical world, the abstract triply-resonant modulator of fig. can be realized with two coupled optical cavities connected to an rf resonator. the resonance frequencies of the two optical cavities can be tuned by applying a voltage to their built-in capacitive phase shifters, which creates coupling between the optical and the rf waves. the phase shifters can be based e.g. on the carrier plasma or linear electro-optic pockels eects. in the text below, we will refer to these tunable optical cavities as active cavities. the two optical resonances of the abstract device of fig. correspond to the two resonant supermodes of the coupled optical cavities, as described below. the two optical cavities are identical and have the same resonance frequencies when uncoupled. in the proposed device, the two cavities are evanescently coupled as illustrated in figs. the coupling produces two new orthogonal states the symmetric and antisymmetric supermodes with resonance frequencies split due to the coupling. the coupling strength is selected to ensure that the frequencies of the symmetric and antisymmetric supermodes are separated by the rf carrier frequency o. the two supermodes of the coupled cavities correspond to the two optical resonances of the abstract device in fig the input pump laser is matched in frequency to the symmetric supermode, while the frequency of generated optical sideband equals the frequency of the antisymmetric supermode . this work considers single sideband generation, but can be easily extended to dual sideband generation in a three-optical-resonance system following . this work considers two congurations of the coupled optical cavities: the basic coupled-cavity design shown in fig. , and the generalized coupled-cavity design shown in fig. in the basic conguration, both supermodes have the same quality factor , while the generalized conguration enables independent control of the q-factors of the optical resonances, leading to higher modulation eciency for broadband rf signals, as described in sec. the rf resonance in the abstract device of fig. is introduced by two lc resonators formed by integrated inductors and the capacitance of the electro-optic region of the active optical cavities. as shown in fig. , the two lc resonators are identical with equal resonance frequencies and are connected to rf transmission lines. the transmission line delivers a dierential rf signal, driving the two active cavities in push-pull mode. unlike the optical resonators which are coupled, the two rf resonators are uncoupled, and their resonances are degenerate and behave as a single resonance, which is the rf resonance depicted in fig. the frequency of this resonance is matched to the rf carrier frequency o. if the rf drive is directly applied to the capacitances of the active cavities , a signicant fraction of the rf power is reected due to impedance a a re,a = re,s = re/ ro ro re o o- o+ optical resonances s+ s- =o/ o o+ m cos o -

"over the past decades mz modulators have been extensively used in mwp systems, both in dis- crete component and photonic integrated circuit form. broadband mz modulators with up to ghz bandwidth have been demonstrated in silicon . modulation beyond ghz has been achieved with mz modulators based on lithium niobate, electro-optic polymer, and plasmonic waveguides . mz modulators, employing traveling-wave electrodes, overcome bandwidth limitations due to the rc time constant and provide impedance matching with the input feed line. nevertheless, the bandwidth of these devices does have limits imposed by imperfect velocity match- ing between the rf and optical waves which has stronger impact on the bandwidth of longer devices. therefore, there is a tradeobetween ecient modulation and large bandwidth, unless near-perfect velocity matching is achieved. microring modulators , shown in fig. , take advantage of optical eld enhancement in the cavity through multiple round trip propagation . when implemented in high-index-contrast materials, these devices feature small size and tight spatial connement of optical and rf electric elds. the small size of the device eliminates the need for traveling-wave electrodes and permits a large rc-time-limited bandwidth. in silicon photonics, microring modulators have been extensively used for low-energy data modulation and have enabled energy-ecient photonic interconnects . modulation frequencies up to ghz have been achieved . similar to mz modulators, regular microring modulators suer from a tradeobetween the modulation speed and eciency in this case that is inherent to singly-resonant devices. this tradeoarises due to the cavity photon lifetime: increasing the photon lifetime helps to improve the eciency but limits the modulation speed, while decreasing the photon lifetime makes the modulator faster, but reduces the eciency . the design of regular microring modulators for rf applications has been studied in . modulation at rf carrier frequencies extending far beyond resonance linewidth of the modulator has been demonstrated by using dierent resonant modes of millimeter-scale whispering-gallery mode disk or ring resonators. in these devices, the rf carrier frequency is matched to the fsr of the resonator, and rf modulation couples adjacent longitudinal resonant modes which are spaced in frequency by the fsr, transferring pump light from one resonance to another, as illustrated in fig. . we refer to such modulators as fsr-coupled modulators. this approach eliminates the tradeobetween the modulation speed and eciency, and has been developed for lithium niobate whispering-gallery mode disk modulators which exhibit very high quality factor . these modulators have found application as rf-optical mixers in photonic receivers that provide high sensitivity and large dynamic range . however, due to the large cross-sectional area of the waveguide and the optical mode, rf electrodes need to be spaced farther from the waveguide core, resulting in weak rf electric eld in ln and limiting the coupling strength between the optical and microwave elds. additionally, the requirement to have the resonator fsr equal to the microwave carrier frequency, typically in the range of to ghz, leads to a large size of the fsr-coupled resonators , and necessitates the use of traveling- or standing-wave rf transmission line electrodes. the modulator studied in this work incorporates the best features of the regular microring modulator and the fsr-coupled modulator shown in figs. in particular, similar to the fsr-coupled device of fig. , the proposed modulator makes use of multiple resonant modes and modulation-induced coupling between them, as shown in figs. , to decouple the speed from the cavity photon lifetime. this eliminates the speed-eciency tradeoinherent in singly-resonant devices such as the regular microring modulator . additionally, the frequency separation between the resonant modes is set by the strength of the coupling between the two cavities, as opposed to fsr-coupled devices where the resonance frequency separation is determined by the resonator radius. therefore, in the proposed modulator, the size of the cavities can be small, which provides tight connement of optical and rf electric elds and strong overlap between them. additionally, the small capacitance of each active cavity permits large rc-time-limited bandwidth, which is discussed in detail in sec. we previously proposed coupled-cavity modulators similar to fig. for on-chip wavelength conversion and modulation of high-carrier-frequency rf bandlimited signals . the use of electro-optic coupled resonators for quantum microwave-to-optical conversion has been studied in . it should be noted that dual-ring modulators were also proposed prior to these works , but these were designed for baseband data modulation and operated in a dierent regime. in the remainder of this paper we analyze in detail the dierent optical and electrical designs of the proposed triply-resonant modulator, illustrated in figs. we start owith a qualitative description of operation of the both optical and the rf parts of the device in sec. in sec. , using the formula for conversion eciency derived in the appendix a, we study the basic and the generalized coupled-cavity structures from figs. and nd their optimal designs that maximize the conversion eciency. in sec. we explore the dierent rf circuits shown in figs. and derive formulae for the gain in conversion eciency produced by the resonant circuits of figs. and compared to the non-resonant case of fig. finally, sec. summarizes and discusses the results of this work.","The text discusses the use of Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulators in microwave photonics systems and compares them with microring modulators. While MZ modulators offer high bandwidth, they face limitations due to imperfect velocity matching between RF and optical waves. Microring modulators, on the other hand, provide small size, high bandwidth, and energy-efficient data modulation. The text also introduces a new modulator design that combines features of both MZ and microring modulators, leveraging multiple resonant modes to decouple modulation speed from efficiency. This new modulator design aims to optimize conversion efficiency for high-frequency RF signals."
"before turning to the mathematical analysis of the proposed modulator, in this section we provide a qualitative description of its optical and rf constituents and their dierent congurations as shown in fig.","The section provides a qualitative description of the optical and RF components of the proposed modulator, as well as their configurations shown in a figure. This information sets the stage for the subsequent mathematical analysis of the modulator."
"our goal is to develop a modulator which eciently converts rf signals into the optical domain. an rf signal modulating a continuous-wave optical input pump produces optical sidebands, and our goal is to maximize the conversion eciency dened as the ratio of the power in the optical sideband to the input pump power, for a given rf drive power, g = psideband ppump . optimizing the modulator for the most ecient conversion into the optical sideband alone is rel- evant when the sideband is detected without the carrier, such as in direct-detection receivers or photonics-assisted microwave radiometers . another application is coherent communications systems, where the modulated signal is detected via the homodyne or heterodyne technique by interfering the sideband with a local oscillator.","Developing a modulator to efficiently convert RF signals to the optical domain is the objective. The modulator aims to maximize conversion efficiency by enhancing the ratio of power in optical sidebands to input pump power. This optimization is significant for applications like direct-detection receivers and photonics-assisted microwave radiometers, where only sidebands are detected without the carrier. Additionally, in coherent communications systems, the modulated signal is detected using homodyne or heterodyne techniques by superimposing sidebands with a local oscillator."
"the two proposed optical modulator designs the basic and the generalized coupled-cavity designs are shown in detail in figs. the basic version of fig. consists of two identical evanescently coupled cavities that have the same unperturbed resonance frequency, o, and a bus waveguide that is coupled to one of them. the coupling strength between the resonators is described by cavity energy amplitude coupling rate , commonly used in the coupled-mode theory in time . when two isolated resonators with the same resonance frequency o are brought together, coupling induced splitting of supermode frequencies places the symmetric and antisymmetric supermode resonances at frequencies o , respectively, as indicated in fig. the coupling strength between the symmetric supermode and the input/output waveguide is characterized by the external energy amplitude decay rate re,s . since both supermodes are coupled to the same bus waveguide through the bottom cavity, the external energy decay rates of the supermodes are equal to each other and are equal to half of the energy amplitude coupling rate of the bottom cavity to the bus waveguide, i.e. re,s = re,a = re/, as shown in fig. if the resonance frequencies of the two cavities are modulated in time to be o , where the shifts are induced by push-pull modulation, the instantaneous supermodes of the coupled cavity system at a given time instance are not orthogonal to the supermodes at the previous time instance. therefore, the energy gets redistributed between the symmetric and the antisymmetric supermodes at each time step. in other words, the rf drive voltage which produces the resonance frequencies modulation leads to energy coupling between the supermodes of the unper- turbed system. therefore, laser pump light at frequency o , entering the input port of the bus waveguide and exciting the symmetric supermode, is transferred to the antisymmetric supermode at frequency o + due to push-pull modulation by the rf signal at carrier frequency o = , replicating the rf spectrum in the optical sideband. the modulated light couples back into the bus waveguide and leaves through the output port. it is essential that the resonance frequencies of the supermodes stay the same during modulation, which happens since the combined optical path length of the two microresonators does not change when their resonance frequencies are modulated in push-pull fashion. this allows the laser pump and the optical sideband to stay on resonance with the symmetric and antisymmetric modes throughout the modulation process. the idea underlying the proposed modulator concept is that the modulation eciency depends on the resonant enhancement of each of the interacting waves. this is conrmed by analytic derivation of the conversion eciency in the appendix a, which shows that the eciency contains a product of the lorentzian lineshape of the symmetric resonance at the frequency of the pump laser and the lorentzian lineshape of the antisymmetric resonance at the frequency of the sideband, see eq. . for the moment, we only consider the eciency limitation due to photon lifetime in the optical part of the modulator; the rf frequency response of the circuits is considered later. the above has several implications for the modulator performance. first, for a given rf eld inside the active optical cavities, eciency of the proposed modulator does not degrade when the rf carrier frequency is much larger than the linewidth of optical resonances, much like the eciency of the fsr-coupled modulator shown in fig. second, for the best modulation eciency, the laser pump should always be aligned to the frequency of the symmetric resonance (under the assumption that the rf carrier frequency is matched to the resonance frequency spacing). third, when the input laser is aligned to the symmetric resonance, the shape of the small signal rf frequency response of the modulator follows the shape of the antisymmetric resonance, as can be seen from fig. this means that the rf bandwidth of the modulator does not depend on the linewidth of the symmetric supermode, and is equal to the linewidth of the antisymmetric supermode (which is inversely proportional to the antisymmetric mode photon lifetime). in case the rf bandwidth needs to be increased, the antisymmetric supermode linewidth needs to be broadened. in the basic design this can be achieved by increasing the coupling strength between the bus waveguide and the ring. however, this is accompanied by an unwanted reduction in q-factor of the symmetric supermode, which reduces the pump enhancement and degrades the eciency of the modulator. this brings us to the generalized conguration shown in fig. the key idea of the gen- eralized conguration is to enable independent control of the q-factors of the symmetric and the antisymmetric supermodes, so that high q-factor for the symmetric resonance can be maintained for maximum pump enhancement, while the q-factor of the antisymmetric resonance can be re- duced just enough to accommodate the modulated optical signal bandwidth within the resonance linewidth, as illustrated in fig. the independent control of the q-factors of the symmetric and the antisymmetric modes is achieved with a novel interferometrically coupled input/output bus waveguide conguration, where the symmetric supermode is coupled only to the input waveguide and the antisymmetric supermode is coupled only to the output waveguide (analogous to a design for nonlinear optics ). in this case, the external energy decay rates of the two supermodes can also be set independently. the interferometric coupling in the generalized coupled-cavity modulator of fig. works in the following way. the pump laser light, entering the input waveguide, couples into both rings in-phase, exciting the symmetric supermode. the in-phase coupling is ensured by designing the optical path dierence between the two rings to be an integer of the light from the symmetric supermode can couple back to the input waveguide, but not to the output waveguide because of destructive interference of the waves coupled from each of the two rings into the output waveguide. the destructive interference is ensured by having a phase shifter in the output waveguide between the two rings, so that the light from the symmetric mode coupled into the output waveguide through the rst and the second rings interfere destructively and cancel each other out. as a result, there is no net coupling of light from the symmetric mode to the output waveguide. the situation is reversed for the antisymmetric supermode, which has elds in the two rings oscillating out of phase with respect to each other. the waves coupled from the antisymmetric supermode into the input waveguide interfere destructively and the waves coupled into the output waveguide interfere constructively, so that the antisymmetric supermode is coupled only to the output but not to the input waveguide. the electric eld congurations of the symmetric and antisymmetric supermodes are illustrated in fig. the energy amplitude coupling rates from the symmetric supermode to the input waveguide is re,s = re,in, and the coupling rate from the antisymmetric supermode to the output waveguide is re,a = re,out, where re,in and re,out are energy amplitude coupling rates between the individual rings and the input and output waveguides, respectively, as indicated in fig. by adjusting the gaps between the rings and each of these waveguides, the external decay rates re,s and re,a can be adjusted independently. note that in the special case when the external energy decay rates re,s and re,a of the generalized design equal those of the basic design, the two designs become equivalent and are expected to have equal modulation eciencies (provided that other device parameters, such as losses and phase shifter eciencies, are identical). rf congurations dierent ways in which the rf drive can be applied to the active cavities of the proposed modulator are illustrated in figs. in the simplest, non-resonant scenario, shown in fig. , the transmission lines are directly connected to the terminals of the capacitive electro-optic region of the active cavities. from the rf perspective, the active cavity is a capacitor cm connected in series with a resistor rm. the capacitor acts as a phase shifter that tunes the resonance frequency of the optical cavity in response to the rf signal, either by means of electrical charge accumulated on the capacitor plates or by the electric eld between them changing refractive index of an electro- optic material. the resistor accounts for the parasitic series resistance between the capacitor plates and the terminals of the active cavities. for a xed rf input power, the voltage on the capacitor plates and, therefore, resonance frequency modulation is maximized when the rf power is completely dissipated on the active cavities. in the non-resonant conguration of fig. , however, part of the rf power is reected back to the source, due to the termination of the transmission lines by the unmatched load of the active cavities. this can be considered a consequence of the frequency of the rf signal not matching the frequency of the rf resonance, which in the absence of a series inductance can be viewed as being innite. this is illustrated in the bottom plot in fig. , which sketches the frequency dependence of the power reection coecient || the rf resonance frequency can be shifted to a nite frequency by connecting an inductor in series with each active cavity. this resonant conguration is shown in fig. by appropriately choosing the inductance l, the frequency of the rf resonator formed by the inductor l and the capacitor cm can be matched to the carrier frequency of the rf drive, i.e. /lcm = o . rf resonance boosts the voltage on the capacitors of the active cavities, improving the eciency of the modulation. the resonance removes the reactive load from the transmission line, however, perfect load matching is still not guaranteed due to the parasitic resistance rm. therefore, the dip in reection function, plotted in fig. , does not reach zero, in general, even at resonance frequency. critical coupling between the rf feed line and the resonator can be achieved by introducing an impedance transforming circuit between them, as shown in the resonant-matched conguration in fig. the gure shows an l-match impedance down-converter, which consists of capacitor c and inductor l, and converts the higher resistance of the load to the lower characteristic impedance of the transmission line . at critical coupling, the dip in the reection function reaches zero, as shown in fig. and eld is maximized on the load capacitor, i.e. the eo region of the modulator cavities. a detailed analysis of the dierent rf schemes is carried out in sec. , where the parasitic re- sistances of the inductors are taken into account. it is shown that resonant and resonant-matched circuits, implemented with cmos inductors with typical q-factors of - , provide sub- stantial - db gain in conversion eciency relative to the non-resonant scheme.","Two proposed optical modulator designs, the basic and the generalized coupled-cavity designs, involve evanescently coupled cavities with the same resonance frequency. The efficiency of the modulator depends on resonant enhancement of interacting waves, with the generalized design allowing independent control of q-factors for symmetric and antisymmetric supermodes. Different RF configurations, including non-resonant and resonant setups, involve capacitive electro-optic regions and inductors to shift the RF resonance frequency. The resonant-matched configuration, with impedance transforming circuits, achieves critical coupling and improves modulation efficiency. Resonant and resonant-matched circuits show substantial gain in conversion efficiency compared to non-resonant schemes."
"the designs of the optical and the electrical parts of the modulator can be considered independently because the electrical circuits provide the voltage which determines the optical resonant frequency swing m, which then leads to modulation of the optical signal. this section gives a detailed analysis of the performance of the optical part of the modulator, specically the basic and generalized congurations shown in fig. , for given m. the electrical conguration which determines this m is analyzed in the next section. an analytic expression for the modulator conversion eciency can be found by applying the cmt-in-time to the two active cavities whose frequencies are modulated in push-pull fashion as o m cos, where is the rf frequency. the derivation is provided in the appendix a. the resulting formula for the conversion eciency g which is applicable to both basic and generalized congurations is g = re,sre,a m + "" + m  # in this formula, ro is the intrinsic decay rate of the energy amplitude of the supermodes due to linear losses in cavities (which is equal to the decay rate of the modes of the individual cavities, assumed equal here), and re,s and re,a are the decay rates of the amplitudes of the symmetric and the antisymmetric supermodes, respectively, due to coupling to the input and output waveguides. for the basic design, which has just one waveguide coupled to a ring with coupling rate re, the supermode coupling rates are re,s = re,a = re/ and are always equal to each other. in the generalized design, the input waveguide is coupled to each of the rings with rate re,in and the output waveguide is coupled to each of the rings with rate re,out; in this case, the supermode coupling rates are re,s = re,in and re,a = re,out, and can be chosen independently from each other. energy amplitude coupling rate determines the strength of coupling between the two cavities; this coupling leads to frequency splitting of the two supermodes. the frequency separation of the laser pump from the symmetric resonance is denoted by , and the frequency separation between the generated optical sideband and the antisymmetric resonance is denoted by these parameters are illustrated in fig. o- o+ sideband pump antisymm. resonance symm. resonance energy figure : graphical representation of the parameters in conversion eciency formula , with decay

is given by eq. . the values of and are related to and through = note that while the rf frequency is not explicitly present in eq. , the eciency does depend on through the above relation. the discussion below examines the maximum conversion eciency that can be achieved with the two proposed modulator congurations. first, we consider a single-frequency rf signal, and nd the parameters which maximize the conversion eciency at this frequency. we then nd the rf bandwidth obtained in this modulator. if an rf bandwidth dierent from the obtained bandwidth is desired, the parameters of the modulator can be changed to ensure the required bandwidth; this is done in the last part of this section which optimizes the modulator parameters for maximum conversion eciency while ensuring the required rf bandwidth. first, we nd the optimum conditions for modulation with an rf signal at single frequency o. by inspection of eq. , it is clear that the conversion eciency is maximized when = = , regardless of the values of other parameters. this is not surprising, since under this condition pump and optical sideband elds are maximally enhanced in the resonators. from eq. , it follows that the coupling rate between the cavities must be designed so that o = , i.e. the frequency splitting between the resonances must match the rf frequency, in agreement with the discussion in the preceding sections. the next step is to nd the optimum coupling strengths. the conversion eciency is maximized for o = when re,s = re,a = s r o + m  . here, m/ corresponds to the energy amplitude coupling rate between the supermodes, see eq. in the appendix a. for a very weak modulating signal when the resonance frequency swing is much smaller than the intrinsic resonance linewidth, i.e. m ro, this simplies to re,s = re,a = ro, which is the critical coupling condition for the supermodes. if the modulation is not weak, the above formula can be viewed as a modied critical coupling condition which takes into account the modulation-induced coupling between the supermodes, which acts as an addi- tional source of loss for the supermodes. note that according to eq. , both of the two proposed congurations of figs. have the same supermode coupling coecients, and show identical performance. after substitution of the optimum values for , , re,s, and re,a, the expression becomes a function of the cavity losses and the resonance frequency swing only. fig. plots the conversion eciency versus normalized resonance frequency swing, i.e. the ratio of the frequency swing to the intrinsic resonance linewidth m/ro. for the blue line, the modulator parameters are optimized at each point along the x-axis. when m ro, conversion eciency increases quadratically with the resonance frequency swing. this is the weak modulation regime where eq. reduces to g = m ro  . in this regime the conversion eciency is proportional to the square of the ratio of coupling rate between the supermodes m/ and the intrinsic decay rate ro. this means that the eciency of the modulator is higher if there is a higher probability of a pump photon being converted to a sideband photon, compared to the probability of losing the photon to dierent loss mechanisms in the cavities. when the modulation is very strong, i.e. m ro, almost all the light from the pump can be converted to the sideband. the dashed lines in fig. show the dependence of the conversion eciency on m for devices optimized for a specic resonance frequency swing opt m . if the resonance frequency swing is smaller than the one the modulator is optimized for (m opt m ), the conversion eciency increases with the swing, reaching its maximum value at m = opt m . as m increases further, the conversion eciency drops, which happens due to backward energy transfer from the antisymmetric to the symmetric supermode. it should be noted that the modulation eciency does not depend on the frequency o, if for each frequency the coupling strength between the cavities is designed so that o = (assuming drive strength m does not depend on o). this is in stark contrast to the modulation eciency of the regular microring resonator modulators, which drops as the signal frequency increases. a thorough analysis of the regular microring modulators for optimal rf-to-optical conversion is given in . as an example, in fig. the small-signal conversion eciencies of the proposed and the regular microring modulators are plotted versus the rf signal frequency normalized by the cavity resonance intrinsic linewidth ro. at each frequency o the modulators are optimized for maximum conversion eciency. in the case of the proposed modulator it is done by adjusting the coupling strength between cavities; in the case of the microring modulator, by adjusting the cavity resonance linewidth through an appropriate choice of ring-bus coupling strength. as expected, the eciency of the proposed modulator stays constant, while the eciency of the microring modulator drops ( db/decade) as the rf frequency increases. let us now nd the rf bandwidth of the modulator optimized for the best performance at a single rf frequency. strictly speaking, eq. is applicable to harmonic rf input only. however, for weak modulating signal that does not deplete the laser pump, formula can be applied to each spectral rf component independently and used to study the frequency response of the modulator. to nd the frequency response, the laser frequency is set at the resonance frequency of the symmetric supermode and the rf frequency is swept around o = , which, according to eq. , is equivalent to sweeping around zero. the magnitude response for several values of resonance frequency swing m is plotted in fig. for each m, the external coupling rates are found from eq. . the maximum values of each response are indicated on the blue curve in fig. with a matching black marker. note that with an increase in m not only does the peak conversion eciency increase but the spectral response becomes wider. the rf bandwidth of the modulator db, dened as full width at half maximum of the magnitude response centered at the carrier frequency o, can be found from eq. to be db = s r o + m  . note that the rf bandwidth is simply equal to the optical bandwidth of the antisymmetric resonance, which is times the critical coupling rate given by eq. . figure plots the modulation rf carrier frequency o/ro conversion eficiency g - - - - proposed modulator m=ro regular microring modulator - - - - - - optimized for all m

resonance frequency swing m. when m ro, the bandwidth is limited to twice the intrinsic linewidth of the ring cavities. as modulation becomes stronger and m increases, the eective energy escape rate in the supermodes goes up, broadening the optical resonances and the rf bandwidth. the analysis above found a modulator design which provides the maximum conversion eciency at a given rf carrier frequency and determined the resulting rf bandwidth for this design. this approach works well for narrowband rf signals, however, many applications require rf bandwidths wider than provided by the above design. our goal now is to obtain a design which not only maximizes the eciency at given carrier frequency o, but also meets a minimum required rf bandwidth. expression is only valid when the external coupling rates are given by . a more general expression for the db bandwidth with arbitrary, independent re,s and re,a is db = + m  . in the above expression, the second term can usually be neglected in comparison to the rst term except when the modulation is strong. therefore, to increase the rf bandwidth, one needs to increase re,a, the coupling rate of the antisymmetric mode , increasing its optical bandwidth. widening of the bandwidth comes at the expense of reduced conversion eciency due to an increase of the denominator in eq. . in the basic design, re,a can be increased by increasing the coupling between the microresonator and the bus waveguide. however, as discussed earlier, the coupling db/ro m/ro improvement of generalized over basic design weak signal regime m/ro

that the generalized design provides over the basic design versus db and m. rate re,s increases by the same amount, which causes an added reduction in conversion eciency according to eq. . in contrast, in the generalized architecture of fig. , re,a can be increased by increasing the coupling of the rings to the output waveguide, without changing the coupling to the input waveguide and changing re,s. thus, broadband modulation can be realized with signicantly higher eciency in the generalized than in the basic design, in principle. to quantify the improvement that the generalized design provides over the basic design, the conversion eciency formula must be expressed in terms of db. this is straightforward for the basic architecture. the external coupling rates are set to be equal in eq. and are expressed in terms of db re,s = re,a = db ro + sdb  m  , and min db = ro + ro m  , if m ro m , if m > ro is the lower limit of the rf bandwidth. finally, the expression for re,s and re,a from eq. are substituted into eq. . for the generalized architecture the process is slightly more involved. one of the decay rates is found from eq. , substituted into eq. and the optimum value of the second decay rate is found among the extrema of eq. , which results in re,s =  m + q [ m ro] + ro m  , re,a = db ro ro  m q [ m ro] + ro m  , and min db = ro. finally, the above expressions for coupling rates are substituted into eq. . in the limit when the modulation is weak and the required photon-lifetime-limited bandwidth is much larger than the intrinsic linewidth , eqs. and simplify to re,s = re,a db ro , re,s ro, re,a db ro . in figs. and the external decay rates, given by eqs. and , are plotted versus the normalized bandwidth for m = ro. fig. shows that for given bandwidth, maximum conversion eciency is achieved when the symmetric resonance is critically coupled to the input port, while the coupling strength between the antisymmetric resonance and the output port is increased until the required bandwidth is reached. the peak conversion eciencies of the basic and the generalized designs are plotted versus the target rf bandwidth db and the resonance frequency swing m in figs. and . the white regions in the plots indicate that no design exists for db < min db, where min db for the basic and generalized designs is given in eqs. and , respectively. the peak conversion eciency of both designs drops as the target bandwidth increases, however, the drop is signicantly slower in the generalized than in the basic design . the improvement the generalized design provides over the basic design is shown in fig. it is negligible when the target rf bandwidth is close to the intrinsic resonance linewidth, which means that the generalized design gives little advantage over the simpler basic design if the target rf bandwidth is low, or the microrings are lossy. the advantage of the generalized design increases as the target rf bandwidth increases relative to the intrinsic linewidth of the resonators. for instance, when the required rf bandwidth is about times larger than the intrinsic linewidth, the generalized design provides db higher conversion eciency than the basic design. therefore, generalized conguration, based on tailoring of resonance photon lifetimes, is expected to be particularly useful when a low-loss optical phase shifting mechanism is available, such as in .","The section analyzes the optical design of a modulator, focusing on basic and generalized configurations. It derives a formula for modulator conversion efficiency based on supermode decay rates and coupling rates. The analysis considers optimization for maximum efficiency with single-frequency RF signals and explores the modulator's RF bandwidth. It compares a proposed modulator design with a regular microring modulator, showing constant efficiency for the proposed design and decreasing efficiency for the microring modulator with increasing RF frequency. The section discusses optimizing modulator parameters for maximum efficiency at a specific RF frequency and achieving a required RF bandwidth. It demonstrates how the generalized modulator design can provide higher efficiency for wider bandwidths compared to the basic design. The analysis shows that the generalized design offers advantages in performance when the required RF bandwidth exceeds the intrinsic resonance linewidth."
"in the previous section, the analysis was focused on determining the optimum optical design of the proposed triply resonant modulator. in this section we turn our attention to the rf design, and nd the gain in conversion eciency that the resonant and resonant-matched circuits in figs. and produce compared to the non-resonant circuit in fig. , for a given input rf power. the rf designs are replicated on the left side of fig. , with corresponding equivalent circuits shown on the right side. the relationship between the resonance frequency swing m and the input rf power prf needs to be determined rst. the rf signal is brought to the modulator by a transmission line with characteristic impedance zo. the voltage amplitude of the forward-propagating wave is equal to vrf = zoprf . the voltage amplitude across the capacitor of the active cavity vcm is equal to the product of vrf and the voltage enhancement frequency response of the rf circuit, vcm = |h| vrf . finally, the resonance frequency swing is related to the voltage amplitude across the capacitor of the active cavity vcm through m = cvcm ngvl = c ngvl |h| p zoprf , where c is the speed of light in vacuum, ng is the group index of the waveguide that makes up the cavities and, nally, vl is the voltage-length product of the capacitive phase shifter . according to eq. , the conversion eciency changes quadratically with m in the weak modulation regime. therefore, the gain in conversion eciency produced by the resonant and resonant-matched circuits is equal to the magnitude squared of the voltage enhancement produced by these circuits relative to the non-resonant design. next, the voltage enhancement frequency responses of the dierent circuit congurations are found. the non-resonant circuit conguration is shown in fig. here the two active cavities of the modulator are directly connected to the terminals of the transmission lines that deliver the dierential rf signal from a signal source to the modulator. the equivalent circuit of one of the branches is shown on the right of fig. , where the active cavity is represented by the series connection of the capacitor cm and the parasitic resistance rm. the voltage on the terminals of the active cavity is equal to the sum of voltages of the incident and the reected waves vm = vrf , where the reection coecient is given by the well known expression = zmzo zm+zo , and zm = rm + jcm is the total impedance of the active cavity with capacitance cm and resistance rm. the voltage on the capacitor of the active cavity is vcm = jcmzm vm, and the voltage response of the circuit is readily expressed as hrc vcm vrf = + jcm . the factor of two in the numerator indicates that the low-frequency components reect entirely due to the large impedance of the capacitor, doubling the voltage on the load. note that rc-time- limited bandwidth depends not only on the parasitic resistance rm, but on the impedance of the transmission line as well. the capacitance of state-of-the-art silicon microring modulators is on the order of femtofarads or several tens of femtofarads, and the resistance is between tens and hundreds of ohms . as an example, the blue line in fig. shows the magnitude response of the non-resonant circuit with cm= ff, rm= ohm, and a transmission line with zo= ohm. in the resonant conguration of fig. , series rlc circuits are formed by the active cavities and integrated inductors. the inductance l is chosen such that the resonance frequency of the rlc circuit is equal to the rf carrier frequency, /lcm = o. the equivalent circuit is shown on the right of fig. here, the parasitic resistance of the inductor is expressed through rl = ol/ql, where ql is the quality factor of the inductor. the frequency response of this circuit, calculated following the same steps as in the previous case is hrlc = vcm vs = lcm + jcm . cm rm vcm l rl l rl c c l rl inductor impedance down-converter prf vm=vrf impedance up-converter

active cavity cm rm zo vcm vm=vrf active cavity prf = vrf zo non-resonant resonant resonant-matched figure : rf congurations of the proposed modulator with non-resonant, resonant, resonant-matched designs on the left and corresponding equivalent circuits on the right. at resonance, the real part of the denominator is zero, and the imaginary part is the inverse of the total quality factor of the rlc circuit, qtot rf = /ocm. this means that the voltage across the capacitor is qtot rf times larger at resonance than at low frequencies. the magnitude of eq. is plotted in fig. for three dierent values of the resonance frequency o, assuming the same values of cm, rm and zo as in the previous example and innite ql. as the resonance frequency approaches the rc-time-limited bandwidth, the maximum voltage gain, shown by the dotted line in fig. , diminishes, which happens due to the reduction of total quality factor of the rlc resonator. the gain in the modulator conversion eciency at frequency o the resonant circuit produces compared to the non-resonant circuit, is equal to the square of the voltage gain, which can be found from eqs. and : g = hrlc hrc o =  qtot rf  "" +  qtot rf ql # . for ql qtot rf , this simplies to g = + (qtot rf ) the dependence of g on the resonance frequency o is shown in fig. for several values of ql and the same values of cm, rm and zo as in the previous examples. for instance, at ghz a resonant circuit with an inductor that has q-factor ql= provides db gain. this illustrates that large gain is expected at microwave frequencies from a resonant circuit with q ls typical of cmos inductors . even larger gains are possible for smaller capacitances and resistances of the active cavities. frequency resonance frequency o rm/zo hrlc cm =

of ql of the integrated inductor. values of cm= ff, rm= ohm, zo= ohm are assumed for the plots in and . the additional gain in conversion eciency the resonant-matched circuit provides compared to resonant design versus normalized parasitic resistance of the active cavities. it is worth noting that the rf resonance quality factor qtot rf , as well as the optical photon-lifetime determine the overall rf bandwidth of the modulator. one can show that, in the resonant circuit of fig. , the voltage vcm on resonance (and for a xed prf power) is maximized if the characteristic impedance zo matches the load resistance rm + rl if the characteristic impedance diers from the load resistance, an impedance matching circuit can be implemented with lumped elements , as is done in the resonant-matched design in fig. if the load resistance is higher than zo, an l-match impedance transformer, consisting of the capacitor c and the inductor l, can be used to down-convert the active load resistance to match it with the characteristic impedance zo, as shown in fig. if the load resistance is lower than zo an impedance up-converter, shown on the bottom right in fig. can be used. in both cases the gain in conversion eciency compared to the non-resonant circuit is g = hmatch rlc hrc o = r rm zo + r zo rm ! g = gg, where the gain term g represents the improvement over the resonant design. here, for the sake of simplicity, we assumed the inductors have innite quality factors. figure shows the dependence of g on the rm/zo ratio. the gain that the resonant-matched design provides compared to the resonant design is about db when rm = zo and reaches db only when the load resistance exceeds the characteristic impedance times. since the matching circuit adds additional complexity to the system, its implementation is justied only when there is a large impedance mismatch between the load and the transmission line.","The text analyzes the RF design of a proposed triply resonant

"in this work we proposed and studied a triply-resonant modulator architecture for high-carrier- frequency rf modulation. the device, supports two optical and one rf resonances and simultane- ously enhances all three interacting waves the laser pump, the rf drive, and the generated optical sideband maximizing the modulation eciency. the modulator was studied by analyzing the designs of its optical and rf parts separately, with eqs. and describing the performance of the optical and the electrical constituents. by combining these equations, the full electro-optic response of the modulator was found. on the optical side, it was shown that the performance of the proposed modulator is intrinsically insensitive to rf carrier frequency . this is in contrast to regular resonant modulators, where the photon lifetime degrades the performance as rf carrier frequency goes up. for the proposed modulator, the photon lifetime is decoupled from the rf carrier frequency, and determines the rf bandwidth around the carrier frequency. two optical designs the basic design shown in fig. and the generalized design shown in fig. were considered. if the spectral width of the rf signal is lower than or on the order of the intrinsic linewidth, the basic optical design shown in fig. works well, and the more complex generalized design brings no performance advantages. however, the generalized design is preferable for rf signals with spectrum signicantly wider than the intrinsic linewidth of the cavity. by proper engineering of loaded q-factors of the supermode resonances in the generalized design, the conversion eciency of wide-spectrum rf signals can be signicantly increased in comparison to the basic design. on the rf side, it was shown that the eciency of the modulator can be enhanced by connecting inductors in series with the capacitors of the active cavities to form lc resonators with resonance frequency equal to the rf carrier frequency. the lc resonance improves the conversion eciency relative to the case when the active cavities are connected directly to the transmission line by approximately (qtot rf ) + , where qtot rf is the quality factor of the resonant circuit. additionally, an impedance matching scheme was proposed for situations when there is large impedance mismatch between the rf feed line and the modulator. in the impedance-matched design, input rf power is directed to maximally build up energy in the active region capacitance of the modulator, maximizing its eciency. the analysis of the previous sections showed that the modulator eciency depends on a number of factors such as eciency of the electro-optic phase shifters, optical loss in the cavities, the capacitance and the resistance of the active cavities, etc. a useful gure of merit can be found from the weak signal peak conversion eciency formula . combining eqs. , , , and the rst expression of eq. , we arrive at g = zoprf  ln   qtot rf vl  where is waveguide propagation loss of the cavities. the last term in eq. , which depends on vl-product of the phase shifter and total quality factor qtot rf of the rf resonator, can serve as a gure of merit for the proposed modulator and can be used to compare performance of the modulator achievable in dierent material platforms, fom = qtot rf vl. electro-optic phase shifters with very low vl-products have been demonstrated in platforms such as lead zirconate titanate-on-silicon nitride with vl= vcm and vl vdb , hybrid barium titanate-silicon with vl= vcm and vl= vdb , and silicon-organic hybrid with vl= vcm and vl= vdb . carrier-depletion-based electro-optic phase shifters in silicon have been demonstrated with vl-product as low as vdb and vl= vcm . although the vl metric for silicon is not as low as for some other platforms, silicon modulators can be readily implemented in cmos processes (including processes with ft s up to ghz and ghz ) alongside cmos electronics, enabling complex cmos rf-photonic systems. moreover, rf resonators, implemented monolithically with cmos inductors available in these processes , can signicantly improve the modulator performance at low cost and with low parasitics. with the increasing importance of high bandwidth rf signal processing, and the complex pho- tonic and electronic-photonic integrated circuit platforms that are emerging , modulators such as those proposed may nd a natural place in mwp integrated circuits. in addition to experimental validation, work remains to address the linearity and power handling of these designs. furthermore, while this paper addresses single sideband generation, the presented ideas can be applied to e.g. triple-optical-cavity systems for dual sideband generation. appendix a: derivation of the conversion eciency formula here, we derive the conversion eciency formula , using the coupled-mode theory in time . the analysis below is general and applicable to both the basic and the generalized architectures of figs. we start with the system of two coupled cavities, which are not coupled to external waveguides, and which have their resonance frequencies modulated in push-pull mode. the cmt equations for such a system can be formulated as d dt a = j a j a with a = a a ! , = o + jro o + + jro ! , = ! . here, a and a are energy amplitudes of the optical elds in the microresonators which oscillate at resonance frequency o in absence of modulation. the term represents the instantaneous changes in the resonance frequencies due to modulation, and dierent signs of in diagonal terms of the matrix indicate that the resonance frequencies of the two rings are modulated in push-pull mode. energy amplitude decay rate ro accounts for the intrinsic losses in the microresonators, and is assumed equal in both here. the derivations are easily modied to remove this assumption. by solving eq. in the absence of the modulating signal = ), we nd the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the coupled-cavity system: a a ! s,a = ! , s,a = o + jro. the two supermodes are referred to as symmetric and antisymmetric because according to eq. , the elds in the two rings are in phase for one supermode and out of phase for the other. according to eq. , resonance frequencies of the supermodes, given by the real parts of the eigenvalues s,a, are split by twice the energy amplitude coupling rate between the rings. additionally, the decay rate of each supermode due to losses in the cavities, given by the imaginary parts of s,a, is the same as cavity intrinsic decay rate ro. the cmt equations can be rewritten in terms of the supermodes of the unperturbed system , d dt b = j b j b where b and b are the energy amplitudes of the supermodes, b = b b ! = a + a a a ! , and = o + jro o + + jro ! , = ! . one can notice that modulating term appears in o-diagonal elements of the coupling matrix , indicating modulation-induced coupling between the supermodes. the prior analysis considered the isolated system of coupled cavities which are not coupled to external waveguide. now, we introduce coupling of the supermodes to input/output ports, which is characterized by energy amplitude decay rates re,s and re,a for the symmetric and the antisymmetric supermodes, respectively. the cmt equation for the amplitudes of the supermode energies and the input/output optical elds can be written as d dt b = j b j b j mi s+ s= j mo b + s+ where = o + j o + + j ! , = ! , mi = pre,s pre,a ! , mo = m t i , s+ = s+ s+ ! , s= s s ! . here, s+, s+, s, s are the input/output eld amplitudes, shown next to corresponding ports in figs. in the proposed modulator the only optical input is the laser pump s+, therefore s+ is always assumed to be zero. the elds at the output of the modulator have amplitude s for the residual pump and amplitude s for the generated optical sideband. in this work, we consider the basic and the generalized designs of figs. for physically realizing the described coupling of the supermodes to the input and the output ports. in the basic design , the input pump light couples to the symmetric mode and the light in the optical sideband is extracted from the antisymmetric supermode via the same bus waveguide, which is coupled to one of the cavities. as mentioned in secs. and , the coupling rates of the supermodes, re,s and re,a, are the same and are equal to half of the energy amplitude coupling rate of the cavity to the bus waveguide, i.e. re,s = re,a = re/ in the generalized design , the pump is coupled into the symmetric supermode and and the generated sideband is coupled out of the antisymmetric supermode through separate input and output waveguides. each waveguide is coupled to both cavities with coupling strength described by cavity decay rates re,in and re,out. as explained in secs. and , the supermode coupling rates re,s and re,a are set independently by the ring-waveguide coupling strengths re,in and re,out, with re,s = re,in and re,a = re,out, where the factors of result from constructive interference of the elds coupled out from the two rings. note that the cmt loss rate ro, the ring-to-waveguide coupling rates re,in, re,out, and the ring-to-ring coupling rate are related to the propagation loss , the waveguide-to-ring power coupling coecients in, out, and the ring-to-ring power coupling coecient rr through = ngro lnc, in = re,in ff sr , out = re,out ff sr , rr = f f sr , where ff sr is the free spectral range of the ring . equations can be solved when an input harmonic modulating signal, = m cos, is applied, where m is peak-to-peak resonance frequency swing. assuming that the frequency of the input pump wave is close to the frequency of the symmetric supermode o and the frequency of the generated sideband is close to the frequency of the antisymmetric supermode, we can simplify the analysis by introducing slowly-varying envelopes with b bejt, b bejt, s+ s+ejt where b, b are the slowly varying envelopes of the supermode energy amplitudes, and s+ is the slowly varying envelope of the input pump wave. the coupled mode equations can then be rewritten as d dt b = j h b j mi s+ s= j mo b + s+ where b = b b ! , h = j m t + ejt) m t + ejt) j , s+ = s+ s+ ! , s= s s ! , to allow closed form solutions, the contribution from the rapidly oscillating exponentials with arguments can be neglected compared to the contribution from slowly varying exponentials with arguments . for numerical simulations of the cmt equations evolution, they may be retained. using the convention introduced in sec. and fig. , we let the pump frequency be dierent from the symmetric supermode frequency o by , so that s+ = s+ejt. we look for solutions for the slowly varying envelopes in the form of b = bejt and b = bejt, where b and b are constants, and is the detuning of generated optical sideband frequency from the resonance frequency of antisymmetric supermode, as shown in fig. the relation between , , the frequency and coupling rate is given by eq. . substituting the expressions for s+, b, and b into eq. and replacing the deriva- tives with j and j we get j b = j h b j mi s+ s= j mo b + s+ where = ! , b = b b ! , h = j m m j , s+ = s+ s+ ! , s s s ! . the rst equation in can be readily solved for the supermode envelopes b and b, and the amplitude of the optical sideband s can be found from the second equation in . the conversion eciency of the modulator, dened as the ratio of the output power at optical sideband to the input laser power according to eq. , is then g = s s+ = = re,sre,a m + "" + m  # the expression is used in this work for analyzing the operation of the proposed modulator. it is important to note that for weak modulation, i.e. m ro, eq. can be written as g = m  re,s + re,a + , where the second and the third fractions can be recognized as the lorentzian lineshapes of the symmetric and the antisymmetric supermodes evaluated at the frequencies of the optical carrier and the sideband, respectively. this conrms the idea that for ecient sideband conversion, each of the interacting optical waves need to be resonant in the device. appendix b: list of symbols table b.: list of

"arxiv:v jan exploring spectro-temporal features in end-to-end convolutional neural networks sean robertson,, gerald penn, yingxue wang department of computer science, university of toronto, canada vector institute, canada {sdrobert,gpenn,yingxue}@cs.toronto.edu abstract triangular, overlapping mel-scaled lters are the current standard input for acous- tic models that exploit their inputs time-frequency geometry, because they provide a psycho- acoustically motivated time-frequency geometry for a speech signal. f-bank coefcients are prov- ably robust to small deformations in the scale. in this paper, we explore two ways in which lter banks can be adjusted for the purposes of speech recognition. first, triangular lters can be replaced with gabor lters, a compactly supported lter that better localizes events in time, or gammatone lters, a psychoacoustically-motivated lter. second, by rearranging the order of operations in com- puting lter bank features, features can be integrated over smaller time scales while simultaneously providing better frequency resolution. we make all feature implementations available online through open-source repositories. initial experimentation with a modern end-to-end cnn phone recognizer yielded no signicant improvements to phone error rate due to either modication. the result, and its ramications with respect to learned lter banks, is discussed.","The abstract discusses exploring spectro-temporal features in end-to-end convolutional neural networks for speech recognition. It highlights the use of triangular filters in acoustics models and introduces alternatives like Gabor filters or Gammatone filters. Additionally, it explores rearranging operations in computing filter bank features to integrate over smaller time scales while maintaining frequency resolution. However, initial experimentation with these modifications did not significantly improve the phone error rate in a modern end-to-end CNN phone recognizer. The implications of these results on learned filter banks are also discussed."
"time-frequency analyses of speech have long been the dominant feature representation for speech recognition. there have been many different transformations that attempt to localize an event in time and frequency, such as wavelets and wigner-ville distributions. a powerful and persistent form of analysis is the short-time fourier transform . it and its derivatives treat a speech signal as a series of windowed stationary processes. even though neural architectures have proven capable of processing raw speech signals , they tend to require far more data, aggressive averaging across learned lters, and even then still benet from some lter-based initialization. the best results on benchmark datasets, such as timit, are still achieved with triangular, overlapping mel-scaled log lters f-banks . f-banks post-process the stft by isolating and integrating over different bands of the power spectrum. the stationary assumption of the stft combined with cleverly spaced band-pass lters makes for a very robust time-frequency representation of the speech signal. there remains the possibility that, at least in the case of neural architectures that do use the time-frequency geometry of the f-bank, what is needed is not necessarily a different representation, but an improvement upon this already time-tested representation, such as by improving its time-frequency resolution. as neural architectures become more sophisticated, a higher resolution may in fact become more desirable. we can incrementally improve the f-bank formula by optimizing the time-frequency trade-off while respecting the conventions of time-frequency features - namely, an audio signal produces a sequence of frames uniformly sampled in time. there are many alternatives to the triangular lter that may have desirable properties for asr. two such lters are the gabor and gammatone. the former has a provably optimal time-bandwidth product , whereas the latter more closely resembles the stimulus response of the human auditory system . both are much more efcient in terms of time and frequency resolution, but because because the stft pipeline integrates over a uniform window in time, much of that resolution is sacriced. the information lost could be valuable, especially to acoustic models that treat the time-frequency representation as a -d geometry, such as those based upon convolutional neural networks . the uncertainty principle, as applied to digital signal processing, states that one cannot have an arbitrarily ne resolution in both time and frequency . filters with short temporal support will have wide bandwidths, and very narrowband lters will have longer temporal support. a second potential improvement is to swap the order of integration in the stft pipeline. this new order would more faithfully represent both the lters time and frequency bandwidths, and can integrate over shorter time scales, since it would avoid incurring a resolution penalty by directly windowing. together, these two improvements would make a lter bank with better time and frequency resolution, though they could also be employed separately. this papers contributions are twofold: rst, we present the aforementioned modications to speech features in detail. these modications, alongside more traditional speech features, are made available in the accompanying open-source python packageas well as through the open-source matlab repository covarep . second, we separately evaluate these adaptations in the framework of an end-to-end speech recognition task. constructing a cnn from the architecture described in for the timit phone recognition task, we decode the phone sequence internally using connectionist temporal classication . we discuss the position of our results as it relates to current trend of learning lter banks from the raw waveform. the code developed for this experiment, including the trained weights, are also open-source and available online mel-scaled log lter banks to illustrate what a coefcient of an f-bank captures in time and frequency, we adapt an argument from . in the continuous domain, a lter bank coefcient k for a given frame of length t centered at sample c, is popularly calculated for signal f as : fbankt,f,w = log z c hk \ fwc,t d where x is the continuous fourier transform of x, hk is the kth real lter in the lter bank, wc,t is a windowing function of temporal support t centered at c. the hk are triangular windows with vertices derived by linearly sampling the mel scale . the mel scale, based on psychoacoustic experimentation, is roughly linear with respect to frequency below hz and logarithmic above. clearly, the frequencies captured by a coefcient of the f-bank are limited to the nonzero region of c hk. because the bandwidth of hk scales with its central frequency, f-banks are robust to time warping . in contrast, acoustic models that operate directly on the normalized power spectrum are sensitive to time-warping. without log- scale spacing, power spectrum models must repeatedly learn the same patterns, transformed by small-scale dilations = f) that are commonly introduced by differences in vocal tract length . multiplying the signal with a window in time blurs the ltered frequency responses. by the convolution theorem, \ fwc,t = b f d wc,t . for large t , b w , the dirac delta function ( r + d = and = for = ). nonetheless, b w will have a nonzero support. this functions similarly to a rolling average over b f and effectively increases the bandwidth of all hk. while not particularly detrimental to wideband lters, the bandwidth of the window can be similar or greater than that of the narrowband lters, which can drastically reduce their discriminative power. the hk are also entirely real in the fourier domain. we can instead let hk represent a lter with a frequency response equal to the point-wise square root of hks, and shift the lter into the modulus. by the convolution theorem and parsevals theorem, equation can be rearranged into an integration over the ltered response of the window: fbankt,f,w = c + log z p hk dt if wc,t is distributed non-uniformly in time, even local transformations of f will affect the resulting coefcient. popular choices of wc,t , such as hann, hamming, or triangular windows, attenuate values at the periphery of the window. in effect, signal transients smoothly transition between overlapping frames. however, a narrowband hk decays more slowly to zero in time and has a number of cusps in its envelope . this makes the integration difcult to interpret temporally.","Time-frequency analyses of speech, particularly using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and mel-scaled log filterbanks (f-banks), have been effective for speech recognition. However, neural architectures may benefit from further refining this representation to improve time-frequency resolution. Alternative filters like Gabor and gammatone offer better resolutions but are limited by the STFT's uniform windowing approach. Proposed improvements include optimizing the time-frequency trade-off and altering the integration order in the STFT pipeline to enhance resolution without sacrificing information. These enhancements are detailed in an open-source Python package and are evaluated for speech recognition tasks, showing promise for improving current filter banks."

"triangular or square-root lters are not the only types of lters that can be scaled in the mel-domain. the rst modication to the spectro-temporal recipe that we explore is to the type of lter employed. we experiment with two additional types of lter: the gabor lter and the gammatone lter. https://github.com/sdrobert/pydrobert-speech https://github.com/sdrobert/more-or-let gabor lters gabor lters have been explored in a variety of contexts. -d gabor lters are often applied to spectrograms (or log-spectrograms) for asr as a collection of spectral-temporal features . their -d construction allows the bank to capture meaningful geometric structures, such as formant movement. likewise, -d gabor bases have been learned as convolutional layers . the present paper focuses on the design and evaluation of spectrogram-like features, rather than high-level spectro-temporal features that sit atop a spectrogram. in , a mel-scaled gabor lter bank was designed much like the one presented here, but it was -d and employed in an hmm-based architecture, not a neural network. recently, trained end-to-end cnns for phone recognition with weights initialized to a gabor lter bank. gabor lters are simply gaussian windows with a complex carrier. they are dened in time as hk = ce t s k +ikt and frequency as c hk = /ce to design the lter bank, center frequencies are sampled along the mel-scale. neighbouring lters frequency supports intersect at their -db bandwidths. gabor banks are calculated the same way as in equation , excluding the point-wise square root. gabor lters have a provably optimal time-frequency trade-off . their regions of effective support in both time and frequency are bounded above by a gaussian window. one downside to the gabor lter is its symmetric frequency response. log-linear scales of speech perception, such as the mel scale, are decidedly asymmetric. the gammatone lter helps mitigate this trade-off.","Two additional types of filters explored in the spectro-temporal recipe are the Gabor filter and the Gammatone filter. Gabor filters are commonly used in various applications and have been applied to spectrograms for automatic speech recognition (ASR). They capture meaningful geometric structures and have been employed as convolutional layers. The design and evaluation of spectrogram-like features, rather than high-level spectro-temporal features, are the focus. Gabor filters, with a complex carrier and Gaussian window shape, provide an optimal time-frequency trade-off. However, their symmetric frequency response may not align well with asymmetric perception scales like the mel scale. The Gammatone filter is suggested to help address this trade-off."
"gammatone lters were derived in . their skewed frequency response lend themselves nicely to existing models of speech perception . gammatones have been employed in asr directly or used as a starting point in learned feature representations . the complex gammatone lter is dened in time as hk = ctnet+iktu where n is the order of the gammatone, usually set to , which controls the skewness of the envelope of h. the lter is dened in frequency as c hk = c! )n the same strategy for designing g-banks can be applied to gammatone lter banks . the gammatone does not have an optimal time-frequency trade-off like the gabor lter. it is a rst-order approxi- mation of the gammachirp lter, which is time-scale optimal . incorporating the gammachirp into the standard time-frequency pipeline is difcult, however, because the gammachirp is not a linear-time invariant system.","Gammatone filters have a skewed frequency response suitable for speech perception models. They are used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and as feature representations. The complex gammatone filter is defined in time and frequency domains, with the order 'n' controlling skewness. Gammatones are not time-frequency optimal like Gabor filters but are a first-order approximation of the gammachirp filter, which is time-scale optimal. Integrating gammachirp into standard pipelines is challenging due to its nonlinear-time invariance."
"as is shown in section , windowing widens the bandwidth of the narrowband lters in the f-bank, a form of spec- tral leakage. increasing the width of the window will decrease the magnitude of the spectral leakage. however, a wider window will capture more of the signal in time, decreasing its temporal resolution. by taking inspiration from scattering transforms , we can modify f-bank computations to better capture low-frequency information. a sample of a rst-order -d scattering transform is: scatt,f,,, u) = t z |f |dt for some family of wavelets with = , and a low-pass lter. second-order scattering transforms are all paths of length of the form ||f | |, and so on. the key observation is that the low-pass window has been shifted out of the nonlinear region. note that |f | =  f f  for real-valued f and , this is an autocorrelation in frequency. in general, the modulus pushes high-frequency information towards zero, where it can be captured by the low-pass . existing work that uses scattering in speech has focused on wide and high-order paths [, , ]. furthermore, though a scattering path is a contractive operation with a normed space as its image, the modulus is nonlinear. the nonlinearity makes it difcult to patch together a cohesive -d geometry along higher-order paths. thus, scattering transforms are most useful in classifying stationary processes . instead of using a cascade of lters to capture high-frequency information, we can simply repeat the process in equa- tion , but with a shorter window. the following is the short-integration filter bank : sif_bankf,w = log z |f p hk|wc,t dt windowing still performs a rolling average in the frequency domain, but, crucially, it is performed after the convolu- tion. all energy within the modulus originated from the bandwidth of interest . hence, the sif-bank produces a more accurate representation of the frequency domain. since the lter bank need only be invariant to small transformations between frames, we can choose t to be propor- tional to the frame shift. more complicated choices of t based on the window type, however, can lead to improved time resolution without introducing signicant aliasing. treating sif_bank as a discretely-sampled signal over sampling interval i tc. applying this mapping and rearranging equation , we can view a coefcient of the sif-bank as discretely sampling a continuous distribution: sif_bankf,w,k =  log |f p hk| wt  for a xed frame shift seconds, the nyquist-shannon sampling theorem dictates that the sif-bank cannot represent frequencies higher than / hertz unambiguously. frequencies above said limit will be subject to aliasing. the size of the window t can be chosen to enforce this limit. one may adjust t until the zero-crossing or -db bandwidth of the main lobe of the windows frequency response matches / hertz. decreasing the size of both the frame shift interval and window size can increase the temporal resolution of a short- integration lter coefcient when the bandwidth of the window is much smaller than the bandwidth of the modulus in equation . a downside of short-integration is that decreasing the window size will not increase temporal resolution when the bandwidth of the modulus is smaller than that of the window already, as is the case for narrowband lters in the bank. for the low-frequency narrowband lters in a psychoacoustic lter bank, windowing has little effect, as the temporal support of these lters already far exceeds that of the frame shift. thus, the coefcients corresponding to a narrowband lter in a sif-bank have poorer temporal resolution than those in an f-bank. this apparent downside is specious: the poor temporal resolution of narrowband lters is an inescapable property of the uncertainty principle, not the short-integration process. any improved temporal resolution in stft-based lter bank features is paid for with a less faithful frequency representation, discussed in section it is worth noting that, due to the poor temporal resolution of narrowband lters, their coefcients will be more highly correlated across time than wideband lters. this makes the sampling along those bands highly redundant when the frame shift is small. redundant representations are not necessarily a bad thing for classication; sequential frames of f-banks are overlapping in time, for example. deltas and double deltas are merely convolutions of f-bank coefcients, which will clearly correlate the frames. previously, f-banks were shown to be more effective than cepstral coefcients for deep learning precisely because the coefcients of the former are more strongly correlated . equation generalizes to arbitrary choices of lter banks. thus, we can combine the gabor lters and gammatone lters with short-integration to generate short-integration gabor banks and short-integration gammatone banks . the theoretical benet of gabor lters is their increased temporal resolution over f-banks, taking far less time to decay to near zero, whilst gammatone lters are more faithful to human auditory perception. lastly, we address the computational efciency of the short-integration lter bank. stft-based computations have identical computational complexity with short-integration o. the short-integration implementations in are fft-based, performing the overlap-save method of convolution. because the fft is not preceded by windowing, short- integration requires much larger ffts to avoid the effects of circular convolution. this, and the required inverse fft, increases computational time. fortunately, a corresponding decrease in computational time comes from performing fewer ffts in total. traditional lter banks require an fft for each frame of coefcients, since each frame windows the signal anew, whereas short integration can leverage coefcients from a single fft-ifft in multiple frames. hence, overall computational times between the types of computation are quite comparable.","Windowing widens the bandwidth of narrowband filters in the f-bank, causing spectral leakage. Increasing window width reduces spectral leakage but decreases temporal resolution. Inspired by scattering transforms, modifications to f-bank computations enhance low-frequency information capture. Short-integration filter banks improve frequency domain representation by performing windowing after convolution. Adjusting window size and frame shift improves temporal resolution but may introduce aliasing. Narrowband filter temporal resolution limitations are due to the uncertainty principle, not short-integration. Redundancy in narrowband filter coefficients enhances classification but impacts computational efficiency. Short-integration variants can be applied to Gabor and Gammatone filter banks for enhanced temporal resolution or auditory perception fidelity. Computational efficiency is comparable to STFT-based methods."
"in order to explore the efcacy of lter types and methods of computation in speech recognition, we tested them as drop-in replacements for f-banks in a deep end-to-end recognizer designed for f-banks. the timit phone recognition task allows for fast experimental comparison and reduces the impact of language modeling on experimental results.","The text discusses an experiment that evaluates the effectiveness of various filter types and computation methods in speech recognition.

"the acoustic model, developed with keras and tensorow , mirrors the one described in . the model comprises of mostly convolutional layers with maxout activations . connectionist temporal classication acts as the loss function for the network. ctc embeds the forward-backward algorithm into backpropagation to output phone labels directly, curtailing the need for external sequence modeling . maxout activations take the per-unit maximum of the output of at least two weight matrices that have received the same input. this doubles the number of trainable weights in memory. after discussion with the rst author of , we halved the weights listed therein to t the million parameter point listed with a size- maxout function. following , the bottom-most layers of the network convolve intermediate representations with a (time frequency) kernel with stride there is only one pooling layer: a max pooling of size after the bottom-most convolutional layer. the rst four convolutional layers have feature maps; the remainder have above the convolutional layers sit time-distributed fully connected layers. the frequency axis is collapsed into the feature map axis with a max operator, and each such vector, indexed by time, is multiplied with the same fully-connected weight matrix. each layer has time-distributed hidden units. a nal time-distributed weight matrix constructs the activation matrix over the phone labels for ctc.","The acoustic model, developed using Keras and TensorFlow, consists mostly of convolutional layers with maxout activations.

"in the rst stage of training, optimization is performed with adam at a learning rate of dropout of probability is applied after the activation function of each layer. the stage ends when a models validation loss has not improved for epochs. afterwards, optimization continues using stochastic gradient descent at a learning rate of and an l weight regularization penalty of the early stopping regime is the same as in the rst stage. weights are saved after each epoch, and the weight set with the lowest validation loss from the second stage is used to decode. initially, we tuned the beam width used in decoding on the development set. however, we quickly found that larger beam widths were almost always preferable, so we xed the width to note that development of the cnn was always performed using f-banks; no architectural or optimization decisions were inuenced by the experimental lters.","During training and decoding, optimization is initially performed using the Adam optimizer and a specific learning rate, with dropout applied after the activation function in each layer.

Subsequently, optimization switches to stochastic gradient descent with a different learning rate and weight regularization penalty. The same early stopping regime is maintained. Weights are saved after each epoch, and the set with the lowest validation loss is used for decoding. The beam width for decoding was optimized on the development set, but larger beam widths were found to be generally better, so a fixed width was eventually set. The development of the convolutional neural network was consistently performed using F-banks, with experimental filters not influencing architectural or optimization decisions."

Pre-emphasis, dithering, and compression were applied using standard Kaldi values. An additional baseline, kaldfb, was used to test Kaldi's built-in f-bank implementation. Phone error rates are measured for each set of filters on the Timit test set."
"to evaluate the performance of the lters and computations, we performed a hybrid non-parametric statistical analysis. first, we performed a friedman test over the four lter types: kaldifb, f-bank, g-bank, and tone-bank. the friedman test is approprate for repeated measures of ranked data with more than two levels when the distribution of the depen- dent variable is not assumed to be gaussian. for the lter bank with the lowest mean per, we performed a wilcoxon signed-rank test between pers derived from regular computations versus those derived from short-integration computation. trials were performed with different seeds for each combination of lter and com- putation, for a total of trained models. one seed - the same seed for each combination of lters and computations - failed to converge, with pers around %. those trials were removed from analysis, leaving trials each.","The evaluation section discusses the performance evaluation of filters and computations using a hybrid non-parametric statistical analysis.

Trials were conducted with different seeds for each combination of filter and computation, resulting in a total of trained models. One seed failed to converge and was removed from the analysis, leaving a total of trials for evaluation."
"the friedman test showed no signicant differences between distributions of per across kaldifb, f-bank, g-bank, and tone-bank features . table shows that the f-bank condition lead to the lowest mean per. a wilcoxon signed-rank test found no signicant difference between distributions of per across f-bank and sif-bank features . therefore we cannot conclude that one feature representation lead to better average pers overall. switching from kaldis f-banks to any of our lter banks improved per by approximately %, but otherwise the lters were quite similar in effect. furthermore, the size of the variance between runs is large enough to discount any gains or losses. the average per across runs on the test set was %. this is higher than the percentage reported in %, but the authors of said paper did not report an average over trials. one trial with sif-banks yielded a per of %. experimentation excluding dithering tended to have lower overall pers of around %, with the lowest observed rate from sif-banks at %. dithering inserts random noise into the signal, which is intended to prevent systems from over-tting on the signal. it is therefore possible to reduce the overall per of the systems by removing dithering, but this is not recommended. one must be careful about what is concluded from these results. they are consistent with the null hypothesis, which suggests that swapping features in end-to-end phone recognition has little effect on per, we conjecture that this is indeed the case. given the recent interest and success of learned lter bank representations, notably that of , one might extend this perspective and claim that exploring xed lter banks is outdated and irrelevant. the difculty comparing this work on xed lter banks and previous work on learned lter banks is that the latter class of paper tends to present a single error rate when discussing results, whereas we have presented a proper statistical analysis of the results over repeated trials. it is unclear whether those individual numbers are representative of a trend or a lucky setting of parameters. for example, as mentioned, we observed the per of % (twice, in fact) from sif-banks. had we only presented the best results, short-integration would have beaten out the best result from . we are not concluding here that sif-banks are better than learned lter banks or even traditional f-banks. the statistical analysis does not support that, nor does it seem likely. but neither can we come to understand more than what is merely possible from individual error rates. we question, however, why learned lter banks tend to perform best when their weights are initialized with coefcients from a xed lter bank, and why the learned banks tend to so strongly resemble a xed lter bank in weight distribution, if what they learn is worth the additional effort and parameters.","The study analyzed different feature representations for phone recognition, including Kaldis f-banks, sif-banks, and learned lter banks. The results showed no significant difference in performance across these features, with only a slight improvement when switching from f-banks to other lter banks. Experiments excluding dithering resulted in lower error rates, but removing dithering is not recommended due to its role in preventing over-fitting. The study's findings align with the null hypothesis, suggesting that swapping features has little impact on performance. The analysis highlights challenges in comparing fixed lter banks with learned lter banks, as single error rates in previous studies may not be representative of broader trends. The study questions the advantages of learned lter banks over traditional f-banks and emphasizes the need for further exploration into the effectiveness of different feature representations."
"we presented two distinct ways of modifying traditional f-bank features in order to produce a higher-resolution time- frequency representation of a speech signal. the rst is to replace triangular lters with gabor lters, which have a theoretically optimal time-bandwidth product, or gammatone lters, which are more faithful to human speech per- ception. the second is to window over the lter response only after taking its power. this leverages the low-pass characteristic of the modulus to minimize information loss after windowing. experimentation with a modern end-to- end cnn architecture with ctc yielded no signicant effect of lters or the modication to computation on per. all lter bank and computation implementations are available as an open-source python package as well as through the open-source matlab repository covarep . all of our results are predicated on swapping out stft features for short-integration features without any adjustments to the model architecture. end-to-end neural asr backpropagates through the decoding process. even at the level of phone recognition, end-to-end models are responsible for modeling an entire sequence. contrast this with an acoustic model in a hybrid dnn-hmm, which is only responsible for discriminatively classifying each frame of features. in the latter case, decisions are a function of only the features within a small context window, whereas an end-to-end system uses the entire utterance context. it is likely that an end-to-end system might spend more resources building a probability distribution over sequences of phones than it does focusing on any interval of speech features, nullifying the differences between lter types and resolution. in our experience, there is considerable variability in the outcome of the training process of end-to-end systems. more experimentation with traditional, hybrid architectures could prove illuminating in this respect. another interesting question is whether a neural architecture exists that is capable of processing shorter frame intervals. as was mentioned in section , frame shift and window size can drastically affect the resolution in time of the feature representation. where the support in time of the square root lters in a mel-scaled f-bank range between about -ms, mel-scaled complex gabor lters with roughly the same bandwidths in frequency range between about -ms in support in time. gabor lters are much more capable of representing information at much smaller time scales. unfortunately, existing dnns already suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients when dealing with long time series data . the end-to-end cnn experimented on here relies on delta and double-delta features to transmit long-term dependency information. increasing the total number of frames in an utterance would make it more difcult to transmit this data. also, averaging over shorter time intervals means less spectral smoothing, which may prove difcult for architectures that are not noise robust. such a feature set may nonetheless be a more user-friendly and robust alternative to backpropagating directly through the speech signal, without requiring the additional parameters.","The section presents two methods for enhancing traditional f-bank features to improve the time-frequency representation of speech signals. The first method involves replacing triangular filters with Gabor filters or Gammatone filters for optimal time-bandwidth characteristics. The second method involves power windowing after taking the filter response to reduce information loss. Experimentation with an end-to-end CNN architecture showed no significant impact of filter types or computation modifications on performance. Results are based on substituting STFT features with short-integration features without adjusting the model architecture. End-to-end neural ASR models backpropagate through the decoding process, enabling modeling of entire sequences compared to traditional hybrid DNN-HMM models. End-to-end systems might focus more on building probability distributions over phone sequences rather than speech feature intervals, potentially negating differences in filter types and resolution. Further experimentation with traditional hybrid architectures could provide insights. The text also discusses the need for neural architectures capable of handling shorter frame intervals and the challenges related to vanishing and exploding gradients with long time series data. Overall, the section highlights the potential of enhanced feature sets for speech signal processing."

"a fully relativistic treatment of conned hydrogen-like atoms j. m. noon august , abstract the dirac equation is used to provide a relativistic calculation of the binding energy of a hydrogen-like atom conned within a penetrable spherical barrier. we take the potential to be coulombic within the barrier and constant outside the barrier. binding energies are derived for the ground state of hydrogen for various barrier heights and conning radii. in addition, it is shown that without the introduction of the principle quantum number n, all energy states of the conned relativistic hydrogen atom, de- termined by a single quantum number k, transfer into the known energy states of the free relativistic hydrogen atom as the radius of connement becomes large.","The text presents a fully relativistic treatment of conned hydrogen-like atoms using the Dirac equation.

"the eect of connement on the energy levels of an atom has been studied by multiple authors, probably rst by michels and deboer , and then followed by sommerfeld and welker who computed the connement radius at which the binding energy becomes zero. these and more recent authors provided non-relativistic treatments of the problem based on the schrodinger equation. see in particular refs. -, the last of which provides additional sources. the intent of this paper is to derive a mathematical model for conned relativistic hydrogen-like atoms, which can then be utilized to investigate the eects of connement on the relativistic energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms. the elds of nano-structures and semi-conductor quantum dots have stimulated renewed interest in the problem we consider as a consequence of the need to take account of the eect on atoms from conning boundaries. because connement of the atom can cause the energy of its electrons to become relativistic, a relativistic treatment of the problem seems required. however, no previous relativistic treatment of the problem described above has been ascertained.","Multiple authors, including Michels and DeBoer, Sommerfeld, and Welker, have previously studied the effect of confinement on the energy levels of atoms using non-relativistic treatments based on the Schrödinger equation.

The study is motivated by the relevance of this issue in nano-structures and semiconductor quantum dots.

"whereas the derived model can be used to compute the eects of connement on the rel- ativistic energy levels of any hydrogen-like atom, the data presented will be restricted to the hydrogen atom . in addition, to avoid imaginary arguments in both the bessel functions and the conuent hypergeometric functions, we restrict total energy e to be less than mc and w to be less than mc solutions for the binding energy values of the conned atom, which can be calculated by solving eq. , requires a numerical method that avoids taking deriva- tives. this is because the unknown e exists in the rst parameter of the hypergeometric functions, and derivatives with respect to their parameters necessitate further approxima- tion. this in turn would produce less accurate results for energy. the most convenient numerical method that does not require dierentiation is the bisection method , which is state n j k ebind s/ / - - s/ / - - p/ / + - p/ / - - s/ / - - p/ / + - p/ / - - s/ / - - p/ / + - p/ / - - table : electron states in the relativistic free hydrogen atom with their associated binding energies, n, , j, and k values. a more complete table can be found in ref. what will be employed to help solve for e. to check the accuracy of the numerical analysis, brents method will also be utilized, which similarly does not warrant dierentiation. in the case of an unconned hydrogen atom, the requirement that the solution of the dirac equation in a coulomb eld converges makes it necessary to cut o the hypergeometric series. this usually involves setting the rst parameter of the conuent hypergeometric series equal to a negative integer, -n , resulting in a description of the state of the atom in terms of the principal quantum number n. here, in the case of the conned atom, no such action is necessary because of the nite value of r. therefore, it would seem that the sate of the electron in this model is distinguished only by the integer k = (j + ), connected to the angular moment quantum number j. however, it will be shown later in this section that we still retrieve the usual states of the hydrogen atom. figure : binding energies for the s/ state, or the ground state, of relativistic hydrogen as a function of the conning radius r. each curve represents a dierent barrier height w, where w = ryd, ryd, ryd, and ryd moving from left to right. figure plots the binding energy as a function of the connement radius r in units of the bohr radius a, for multiple xed values of the barrier height. as the radius of connement increases, all energy curves approach the value ev associated with the s/ state in the free atom. figure also shows that as the height of the barrier increases, so does the binding energy . the relationship between the barrier height and the binding energy can be seen more visibly in figure , where curves are plotted for four dierent xed conning radii. to check the accuracy of the results presented thus far, table compares energy values obtained using brents method to energy values obtained using the bisection method, where each set of energy values were computed using the same domain of r values. the essentially identical results given by both methods serve as a check on the precision of the values displayed in figures and figure : binding energies for the s/ state of relativistic hydrogen as a function of the barrier height at multiple xed conning radii. r e e table : binding energies for the ground state of relativistic hydrogen with barrier height w = ryd via two numerical methods. when the barrier wall is very close to the nucleus, the electron can only be in its ground state. conversely, when the barrier is moved further out from the nucleus, the resulting in- crease in conning volume accommodates states of the electron with larger orbits, associated with higher values of the quantum numbers n and in the free atom. in particular, figure graphs the binding energies derived from additional solutions of eq. with k = and larger values of r. the graph shows that as r increases, the computed energy values asymptotically approach the binding energies of the free atom in table corresponding to the electron states s/, s/, and s/, which all have = figure : binding energies as a function of the connement radius with w = ryd. for k = , the s/, s/, and s/ states appear as r becomes large. for k = +, the p/, p/, and p/ states appear as r becomes large. it is noteworthy that these values are determined only by k and the size of the conning volume restricting the electron to specic states. figure shows a set of solutions of eq. for k = +, with the same domain of r values as in figure here, as r increases the energy values approach the binding energies of the free atom in table corresponding to the electron states p/, p/, and p/, all of which have = and j =","The text discusses the computation of effects on the relativistic energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms under confinement.

"using the dirac equation, a mathematical model for the connement of relativistic hydrogen- like atoms in a spherical penetrable barrier was derived. satisfying the boundary conditions at r = r produced an equation from which the binding energies for hydrogen-like atoms could be calculated, determined by the parameters w, k, r, and z. binding energies for the ground state of relativistic hydrogen were calculated as a function of the conning radius at various barrier heights. the binding energies grew with a decrease in the conning radius r and/or a growth in the barrier height, which is a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. furthermore, the conned ground state atoms binding energy asymptotically approached the ev binding energy of the free ground state atom as the conning volume grew. additionally, as the connement volume grows further , excited states of the hydrogen atom (associated with the proper value of k) appear without the introduction of the principal quantum number n. this implies that the possible energy eigenvalues of the conned system are uniquely determined by the radius of connement and the value of k, as opposed to the energy values of the free atom being determined by n and k.","A mathematical model based on the Dirac equation was used to study the confinement of relativistic hydrogen-like atoms within a spherical penetrable barrier. By satisfying boundary conditions at a certain radius, an equation was derived to calculate binding energies for these atoms. The binding energies were found to increase as the confinement radius decreased and/or barrier height increased, reflecting the uncertainty principle. As the confinement volume expanded, the binding energy of the confined ground state atoms approached the binding energy of free ground state atoms. Excited states of the hydrogen atom emerged with specific values of the parameter k, without the need for the principal quantum number n. This indicates that the energy eigenvalues of the confined system are uniquely determined by the confinement radius and the value of k, contrasting with the energy values of free atoms determined by n and k."

presence of a light particle mediating self-interactions, we nd that the nite-size eect may dominate the velocity dependence. we present an explicit example in the context of a qcd-like theory and discuss possible ways to dierentiate puy dark matter from the usual light-mediator scenarios. particularly relevant for this are low-threshold direct detection experiments and indirect signatures associated with the internal structure of dark matter. introduction. the dark matter nature is one of the most important open questions of our century. un- til now, we have only observed dm via its gravitational eects, with data supporting the hypothesis that dm is collisionless at large scales . this is at the core of the celebrated cdm model and its most stringent tests come from large objects such as clusters of galax- ies, which constrain the self-scattering cross section per unit mass, /m, to be below cm/g . despite this, larger values of /m are not ruled out in small objects such as galaxies and dwarf spheroidals. nonetheless, that requires the self-scattering cross section to decrease with the dm velocity, because the particles residing in larger dm halos move faster. this paradigm is known as self- interacting dark matter and has attracted a lot of attention from astronomers and particle physicists in the last two decades. one reason for this is the apparent mass decit in the inner regions of small-scale halos with respect to the predictions of collisionless dm. this has led to the so- called small-scale crisis of the cdm model, which might be solved by sidm because it predicts dm halos with smaller central densities . for a review see . another reason for the continued interest in sidm is that it gives clues about specic properties of dm, which can be used to search for it. for instance, large and velocity- dependent cross sections might hint at a long-range force, which in turn suggests the presence of a light mediator. in fact, since such a particle is a rather generic feature of several well-motivated dm models, velocity-dependent sidm is often associated with a light mediator. in this work we discuss another source of velocity dependence for /m , which hints at dm particles of nite size, rdm. as is shown in fig. , a momentum transfer much smaller than r dm is too small to measure the internal structure of the dm, so the latter acts as a point-like particle. on the other hand, when the momentum trans- rdm rdm -          figure : form factors as a function of momentum-transfer q in units of the inverse root-mean-square radius rdm. solid, dashed and dotted lines correspond to the dipole, tophat and gaussian distributions . fer becomes larger than r dm, the internal structure of the particle is probed. as specied below, this can happen in such a way that the phase dierence among the scattered waves leads to a suppression in /m. this is indeed the desired velocity dependence. in fact, as we will see, even in the presence of light mediators, the nite size may be the dominant eect. we will refer to this scenario as puy dm. beside the self-scattering eects, the fact that dm has a nite size leads to a very rich phenomenology, as has been explored for several concrete dm candidates . ii. scattering of nite-size dm particles. let us rst consider the scattering of two nite-size objects, which for simplicity will be modeled as a collection of point-like constituents that coherently scatter by means of a spin-independent yukawa interaction. the corres- arxiv:v jan shape rdm f tophat r

scattering object. we will also assume that the contribution of the binding force to the scattering rate is negligible. this is the case e.g. if such a force leads to a momentum-suppressed scattering amplitude. then, the interaction hamiltonian for two objects des- cribed by the density proles ( x) and ( y) is hint = z d xd y( x)e| x y|/ | x y| ( y) = z d q f( q) q + f( q) . where is the range of the interaction, is a cou- pling constant, and we have introduced the form factor fi( q) r d r ei q ri( r). hence, the center-of-mass dier- ential cross section in the born approximation is d d= s f( q) q + f( q) ( q q) , where is the reduced mass and q is the momentum transfer. for identical particles, the sec- ond term must be included and s = / . an illustrative example is the electron scattering o nite-size objects. this is determined by a coulomb in- teraction with e( r) = ( r) or fe( q) = in this case, eq. gives the well-known rutherford scattering formula, which can be used to infer the shape of nite-size objects. when applied to the proton, one nds a density distribution decreasing exponentially with a characteristic scale r = gev . the lat- ter is the dipole distribution , generally ex- pected from wave-function solutions to various potential wells . we apply now eq. to non-relativistic dm. assum- ing that the dm particle is spherical, i.e. f( q) = f, the s-wave dierential cross section reads d d= "" f + q + # q=mv sin / , where = here and v are respectively the scattering angle and the relative velocity in the center- of-mass frame. while the exact form of and hence f in eq. needs to be determined by solving for sidm with a light mediator puffy dm dipole tophat gaussian rdm = t = t = t = t = - - - - m vrdm m v figure : transfer cross section as a function of the force range, , and the dm size, rdm, both in units of /mv. here of eq. is assumed to be constant. the wave function from the schr odinger equation of the composite state, the dierential cross section is not sen- sitive to the details of as long as it is always positive and it goes to zero suciently fast at large radii. in that case, the dm size or more precisely the root-mean-square radius r dm z d r r = df dq q= is positive. thus, f decreases for small momenta from f = r d r, which can be normalized to without loss of generality. fig. illustrates this for the three representative distributions as listed in table i. together with eq. , all this implies that the cross section is con- stant at low velocities and eventually approaches zero, even if the range of the interaction is short. iii. dm scattering in astrophysical halos. be- cause of the form factor, for low velocities we expect isotropic scattering, whereas for larger velocities forward scattering is more probable. due to this, the transfer cross section, t r dd/d, captures the self-interaction eects in dm halos better than (see e.g. ), and will be adopted below. fig. illustrates the dependence of t on the inter- action range and the particle size rdm. as apparent from the plot, t is largely independent of the exact ex- pression for the form factor and therefore of . fur- thermore, roughly speaking, the transfer cross section is constant for mv min{, r dm}, starts decreasing at mv min{, r dm}, and approximately scales as /v cm/g cm/g cm/g <v> <tv>/m /m m rdm figure : velocity dependence of the transfer cross section of puy dm. best-t curves to data for the dipole , tophat and the gaussian distributions in table i. the inset shows the % c.l. contours on the pa- rameter from eq. and the dm size together with the corresponding parameter sets plotted in the main gure. for mv min{, r dm}. this directly follows from rewriting the transfer cross section as t = z dq "" f + q +  q q# q . see the appendix for details. when the range of the yukawa force is much larger than the dm size, such a ve- locity dependence of t coincides with that of the born regime of sidm with a light mediator . in fact, fig. shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the latter and the self-scattering of nite-size dm. fur- thermore, there could be a mediator lighter than the dm and still the velocity dependence is determined by the dm size if rdm. the dm relative velocity in astrophysical halos typ- ically follows a maxwell-boltzmann distribution trun- cated at the corresponding escape velocity, vmax. the velocity-averaged transfer cross section is then t v= z vmax ft vdv , f = vev/v v . in the context of sidm as a solution to the small-scale structure problems, a semi-analytical method has been proposed in to infer, from observational data, the value of t v/m for a given dm halo . this method was applied to ve clusters from , seven low- surface-brightness spiral galaxies in and six dwarf galaxies of the hi nearby galaxy survey sample . fig. shows these results respectively in green, blue and red. the set of points is also in agreement with cluster bounds mentioned in the introduction, giving t /m cm/g . while cosmological simula- tions show this semi-analytical method works for isolated halos , recent studies suggest that tidal stripping may further modify the density prole of satel- lite halos . such eects are not included here, because the galaxies shown in fig. are in the eld. postulating a dm nite size much larger than the range of the yukawa force, i.e. rdm, provides an excellent t to the velocity-dependent cross section preferred by the galactic and cluster systems. the corresponding best- t of eq. to the data above is shown in fig. for the dipole, tophat and gaussian distributions, separately. as expected from the aforementioned remarks, there is almost no dependence on details of the form factors even though they correspond to substantially dierent density distributions. the gure also shows that, in order to have the right velocity dependence, the dm size needs to be hundreds of times larger than the compton wavelength. this explains the name puy dm. if the yukawa force is associated with a mediator , requiring that the nite size dominates the scattering, i.e. rdm implies m m. this shows that the mediator can still be substantially lighter than puy dm. moreover, if we impose m/m as required in the born expansion, /m = /m cm/g leads to m gev. consequently, puy dm must lie at the gev scale or below. iv. a model of puy dm. here we only sketch a possible realization of puy dm while details will be dis- cussed elsewhere. it is a qcd-like conning theory with nc colors and two avors of quarks: one charm quark much heavier than the conning scale and one nearly massless down quark. they respectively have charges +/ and / under a dark ud gauge group with nc = this is associated with a massive dark photon d, which can act as a portal to the standard model by means of the kinetic mixing between the ud group and the sm hypercharge. there are no dark weak interactions. we assume there is an asymmetry so that anti-charm quarks are annihilated while the remaining charm quarks end up in the baryonic c state. the latter interacts by exchanging the pseudo-scalar (d d) and the vector (d d), which lead to attractive and repul- sive forces respectively. on the one hand, it is likely that the -exchange dom- inates binding c baryons into nuclei because its range is larger given that the mass is due to the anomaly and hence suppressed as m /nc, as opposed to the mesons for which m . in view of this, in the follow- ing we assume the typical mass number is a on the other hand, the nucleus-nucleus scattering is dom- m rdm= m rdm= m rdm= xenont cdmslite cresst ii - - - - - - m gd figure : direct detection bounds on our qcd-like theory of puy dm from nucleon recoil events in xenont , cmd- slite and cresst ii , assuming md = mev. for a heavier dark photon, this bound scales with m d. see text for details. inated by the exchange of mesons because the latter are essentially massive gauge bosons coupled to d-number giving rise to coherent spin-independent scat- tering, while the -exchange induces a spin-dependent momentum-suppressed scattering. therefore, the range of the scattering force is shorter than the size of the nuclei rdm a/m a/nc. as a result, this model is a realization of puy dm. for instance, parameters such as nc = , a , mc mc gev, r dm mev, m mev, m mev and m/m realize the desired self-scattering cross section and its velocity dependence. we take d to be slightly lighter than . then the size of the kinetic mixing is either or to satisfy beam-dump experimental data and supernova observations . in the cosmological history, presumably much of the entropy in this sector ends up in a thermally populated gas of mesons. these decay via d d or self-annihilate via dd before bbn for the range . direct detection signatures are closely related to the dm nite size. the recoil-energy spectrum is that of a point-like dm particle scattering via a contact in- teraction times the square of the dimensionless factor = fd m d/(q + m d). its rst part is the form factor associated with the ud charge and the second one parametrizes the dependence on the media- tor mass. fd = because the dm particle is neu- tral under ud . thus, to leading order in q, q f d/, which induces dm scattering rates enhanced by the fourth power of charge radius. the latter is given by eq. with f fd and is expected to be similar to r dm on dimensional grounds. in the view of this, we estimate current direct-detection limits by im- plementing such a recoil spectrum in ddcalc . the results are shown in fig. for various choices of the charge radius and md mev. for a lighter d, the bound becomes more stringent than that due to an enhanced . hence, xenont signicantly constrains dm masses above gev, while low-threshold direct de- tection experiments such as cresst-ii and cdmslite can probe smaller masses. a salient aspect of this dm setup is that energy recoils are momentum-suppressed albeit the enhancement due to the large charge radius. this is in sharp contrast to the direct detection of point-like sidm by means of light mediators. since q is proportional to the reduced mass of the colliding particles, we expect signals in experiments searching for nuclear recoils but not in those looking for electron recoils, whose is much smaller for the dm masses of interest here. likewise, the internal structure of puy dm allows for up-scattering processes, giving rise to a wealth of indi- rect search signatures if dm de-excites ejecting sm par- ticles. in our qcd-like model this happens due to kinetic mixing, and for the parameters considered above, the re- quired exciting energy can be estimated as o mev. while this is much greater than the typical galactic dm kinetic energy, dm might be excited by inelastic self- scatterings in massive clusters of galaxies or by collisions with high-energy cosmic rays . the former case may lead to radio and x-ray signals or dm dissipative cooling ; while the latter might trigger novel signals in direct-detection and neutrino ex- periments as in e.g. . a detailed investigation is beyond the scope of this letter. before concluding, we would like to emphasize that puy dm does not necessarily require qcd-like dynam- ics. indeed, puy dm can be realized in other theories of extended objects. for instance, topological de- fects, such as q-balls or skyrmions , are naturally stable, have a large size and self-interact. the study of puy dm in the form of defects is an ongoing project. v. conclusions. we have shown that if dm is an ex- tended object with a size hundreds of times larger than its compton wavelength, the corresponding self-interaction cross section varies with velocity in a way that is largely independent of its internal structure. for cross sections larger than cm/g at v , this provides a solution to the problems of the cdm model in small-scale astro- physical objects while still being in agreement with clus- ter observations. a qcd-like theory where dm is a dark nucleon has been used to illustrate our results, which are nevertheless general and can be applied to a broader range of theories. for this reason, we believe puy dm opens up a new avenue for sidm model-building.","The text discusses the concept of ""puffy dark matter"" (puy DM), which refers to dark matter particles with a finite size larger than their Compton wavelength. The study examines the implications of puy DM on addressing small-scale structure issues in the context of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. The research investigates how self-interaction cross sections vary with velocity, independently of the dark matter's internal structure. Puy DM is proposed as a solution to the small-scale crisis of the CDM model and is analyzed in the context of a QCD-like theory. The text suggests that puy DM may dominate the velocity dependence even in the presence of light mediators. Direct detection experiments and indirect signatures associated with the internal structure of dark matter are discussed for distinguishing puy DM from conventional scenarios. The text concludes that puy DM offers a promising avenue for building models of self-interacting dark matter."

"some people believe that twitter and blogs are enthusiastically posted, but most people are supposed to search on the internet. therefore, analysis of the search behavior of people of society is very important in grasping social move- ments. in this research, we analyze theoretically by the idea of social physics, how television information, net information, or blog, twitter etc. inuences peoples search behavior. the subjects of the analysis are seasonally limited dates, and many people participate in the event. specically, valentines day, halloween, christmas, and new years countdown. in addition, in the habit peculiar to japan, we also analyzed eho-maki, which eats scroll sushi on february , and an event to eat eel on the midsummer occasion day of summer (the day of ox in mid- summer). in particular, specically, valentines day, halloween, christmas, and new years countdown last for only one day and thus, it is easier to ana- lyze the rising excitement and subsequent wane in interest. in many european countries, people return to their homelands for christmas and enjoy a long christmas break. in constast, in japan, however, christmas is a one-day event in which young people have christmas parties with friends but do not return home. in japan, therefore, it is not until the new years vacation of the follow- ing week that people return to their hometowns. thus, in japan, christmas is very similar to halloween. in japan, feb. is the traditional day to eat eho-maki. eho-maki are thick sushi rolls shown in g. which is believed to bring good fortune if eaten while facing the years eho like g. not all, but many japanese people have eho-maki at this day. figure : eho-maki in japan. figure : how to eat eho-maki in japan. on the day of the ox in midsummer japanese have a custom to eat eel which started in the edo period, th century. eel is a popular food for japanese people, and it is expensive, so eating eel on the day of the ox in midsummer once a year is a big concern. on the day of the ox in midsummer japanese have a custom to eat eel which started in the edo period. the day of the ox, which is named after one of the twelve animals of the chinese zodiac. according to one legend, long before the scientic reasons were established, in the s well- known scholar gennai hiraga came up with the custom as part of a marketing ploy to boost limp summer sales when the owner of a struggling eel store asked the wise man for some business advice. in g., we show the typical cooking of eel in japan for the day of the ox in midsummer. thus, this study examines the peaks and falls in interest in these time-limited events, focusing on the medium used to perform searches and on what cohort of the population perform those searches. the mathematical model of search behavior is used for the analysis . figure : typical cooking of eel in japan.","The text discusses the importance of analyzing search behavior to understand social movements, using social physics theory to examine how television, internet, blogs, and Twitter influence people's search behavior.

"in the theory of search behavior , the interest and concern on a certain topic can be calculated using a mathematical model of dierential equations. here, we introduce i as the interest or concern on a certain topic. we construct a mathematical model based on the mathematical model for the hit phenomenon within a society presented as a stochastic process of interactions of human dy- namics in the sense of many body theory in physics . as in the model in , we assume that the intention of humans in a society is aected by the three factors: advertisement, communication with friends, and rumors. ad- vertisements act as external forces; communications with friends are a form of direct communication and its eect is considered as interaction with the inten- tion of friends. the rumor eect is considered as the interaction among three persons and a form of indirect communication as described. in the model, we use only the time distribution of advertisement budget as an input, and word-of- mouth represented by posts on social network systems is the observed data for comparison with the calculated results. the parameters in the model are adjusted by the comparison with the calculated and observed social media posting data. according to , we write down the equation of purchase intention at the individual level ii as dii dt = x ca aii + x j dijij + x j x k pijkijik where t is the time, dij, pijk, and fi are the coecient of the direct communication, the coecient of the indirect communication, and the random eect for person i, respectively. the advertisement and publicity eects are include in a which is treated as an external force. the index means sum up of the multi media exposures. word-of-mouth represented by posts on social network systems like blog or twitter is used as observed data which can be compared with the calculated results of the model. the unit of time is a day. here, it is assumed that the height of interest i of people attenuates exponentially. although it is known that this is known to occur in movies and the like , attention such as events and anniversaries is known to attenuate by a power function. in the case of social interest, we attenuate the intermediate between the exponential function and the power function , but here we simply adopt exponential decay. we consider the above equation for every consumers in the society. taking the eect of direct communication, indirect communication, and the decline of audience into account, we obtain the above equation for the mathematical model for the hit phenomenon. using the mean eld approximation, we obtain the following equation as equation for averaged intention in the society. the derivation of the equation is explained in detail in ref.. di dt = x ca + i + pi this equation is the macroscopic equation for the intention of whole society. using this equation, our calculations for the japanese motion picture market have agreed very well with the actual residue distribution in time . the advertisement and publicity eects are obtained from the dataset of m data and the wom represented by posts on social network systems are observed using the system of hottolink. we found that the indirect communication eect is very signicant for huge hit movies.","Interest and concern on a topic can be mathematically modeled using differential equations in the theory of search behavior.

Parameters in the model are adjusted by comparing calculated results with word-of-mouth data from social network systems.

Indirect communication is found to be significant for successful movies."
"in the new mathematical model for search behavior, we use daily blog and twit- ter postings as the external force. therefore, we extend the above mathematical model for hit phenomena to include the eects of twitter and blog as external eld as follows. di dt = ct v at v + cnetnewsanetnews + ct witterat witter + cblogablog + i + pi in the above equation, i is the intention to search a certain topic using google trend and ct v , cnetnews, ct witter and cblog correspond to the strength to inuence willingness to search the certain topic. i + pi correspond to the direct and indirect communications in the previous mathematical model for hit phenomena. in the model of the present paper, these terms correspond to the direct and indirect eect of searching the topic by other people. on the real calculation, we use advertisement time data on tv from m data co. ltd. and the internet news site data, daily twitter posting data and daily blog posting data on the certain topic from hottolink co.ltd. the daily search data comes from google trend as the reference of our calculation. the parameters ct v , cnetnews, ct witter, cblog, d and p are determined in similar way as the previous model by using the metropolis-like mote carlo method as noted in the previous paper. we dene here r-factor to check the correctness of the adjustment of parameters. r = p i g) p i + g), where f and g correspond to the calculated i and the observed num- ber of google trend data. the r-factor is originally dened by j b pendry to adjust the positions of atoms on surface in the calculation of low energy electron diraction experiment where measured electric current - voltage curve compared with the corresponding calculation. the smaller the value of r, the better the functions f and g. thus, we use a random number to search for the parameter set that minimizes r. this random number technique is similar to the metropolis method, which we have used previously. we use this r-factor as a guide to obtain the best parameters for each calculation in this paper. we employ the monte carlo method like metropolis method to ne the minimum of r. this is very similar for nding the minimum of total energy in the rst principle calculation. in the real calculation to adjust the parameters cx, d, and p, we should take care of the local minimum trapping like the rst principle calculation in material physics. it is well-known that there are several ways to nd the minimum condition like the steepest descent, the equation of motion method and the conjugate gradient method. even in the actual calculation of the rst principle calculation or the density functional theory, we should be careful of the danger of local minimum trapping. in this paper, the way we employ is just do the calculation using the several initial value in the metropolis-like method to avoid the local minimum trapping. to check the accuracy of the parameters adjusting, we use the r-factor value. for every calculation which we show in this paper, the r-factor is below . actually, the parameters ct v , cnetnews, ct witter, cblog, d and p in equa- tion can be considered as functions of time, because peoples attention changes over time. however, if we introduce the functions ct v , cnetnews, ct witter, cblog, d and p, we can tune any phenomena by adjusting these functions. thus, we retain ct v , cnetnews, ct witter, cblog, d and p as constant values to examine whether equation can be applied to any social phenomena.","The text introduces an extension to a mathematical model for search behavior by incorporating daily blog and Twitter postings as external forces.

"we analyzed christmas, halloween, new year countdown, valentines day, ewaki roll, and eel of the midsummer day of the ox as events with limited time. looking at the analysis results, the results were divided for four of christmas, halloween, countdown, valentines day, and the two of eho-maki and eel. these two groups are thought to depend on surprises or happening for the event and its preparation. in halloween, there are many matters to investigate beforehand, such as what kind of costumes they themselves, what kind of cos- tumes they are going to do, what kinds of costumes will be popular this year. at christmas in japan, there are not many things to consider beforehand, such as what kind of surprise there are lovers to book a christmas dinner with. in the new year s countdown, since the taste of the countdown is dierent for each gathering, it is necessary to gather information in advance according to which place to go to, which event to go to and which bar to go to. at japanese valentines day, women collect information in advance, whether women make their own chocolate for her lover or they purchase high-end chocolate at some famous brand shop. meanwhile, there are few kinds of eho-maki to eat as an event, and there is no element to look into in advance as there are also decided how to eat. also, there is no surprise when eating eho-maki. as for the eel to eat on the midsummer day of the ox, as shown in the g., the method of cooking has been decided traditionally. it is impossible to make home made, so japanese people have to eat eel at a restaurant. therefore, the information to be checked figure : result of calulation of ct witter and cblog before and after valentines day. figure : result of calulation of ct witter and cblog before and after the eho- maki. in advance is the only restaurant to eat. besides, there is not much dierence in eels cuisine for each restaurant. in this way, events that need to check information suciently in advance are aected by twitter. on the contrary, in the case of an event where there is no surprise and there is no need to check in advance, the eect of twitter at the prior stage is small, and the inuence of blog is expected to be relatively high. therefore, if search actions that are strongly inuenced by twitter are ob- served beforehand, those who come to the event are collecting information. for those people, event-related marketing will be eective. in this way, the method of this research can be applied to marketing.","Events such as Christmas, Halloween, New Year countdown, Valentine's Day, Eho-maki, and the Midsummer Day of the Ox were analyzed as events with limited time. The analysis showed that these events can be grouped based on the need for surprises or preparation. For events like Halloween and Valentine's Day, significant pre-event investigation is required, such as choosing costumes or deciding on special treats. On the other hand, events like Christmas in Japan or the eel-eating tradition on the Midsummer Day of the Ox do not require much pre-planning. The study indicates that events requiring pre-information gathering are influenced by Twitter, while events with no surprises are more influenced by blogs. This suggests that event-related marketing strategies can be tailored based on the level of pre-event information checking needed. The research methodology can be applied to marketing strategies for future events."

"part of this work is a continuation of the program started in kmrsw and kmr of studying unbounded derivations in quantum domains, their implementations, and possible spectral triples associated to them. another part of this work was inspired by a glimm and jae note gj on reection positivity for the laplace operator in rn. additionally, we were inuenced by the jae and ritter paper jr , which considered reection positivity for laplace operators on manifolds equipped with a reection. reection positivity in the euclidean space is the following remarkable inequality in l: f,  + m f for all f h+ = {f l : f = , for x < }. here is the laplace operator in rn, m is a constant and : l l is the reection in the rst coordinate: f = f. this inequality is a key step in proving the reection positivity axiom of osterwalder- schrader for the free eld, see gjbook . reection positivity has been generalized in many di- rections, of particular interest for this note is already mentioned manifold generalization in jr . a natural question is then if such ideas can be extended to noncommutative geometry to include examples of laplace-type operators on noncommutative manifolds. one of the simplest possibilities, studied in detail in this paper, is a quantum cylinder which classically has a natural reection through the middle. the noncommutative cylinder was constructed in kl and further stud- ied in kmrs and kmr . it has a natural rotational symmetry as well as a reection, as will be shown later, and it also has an analog of the lebesgue measure. to dene a class of in- teresting, reection invariant, laplace-type operators in the corresponding hilbert space we use rotationally covariant unbounded derivations on the quantum cylinder that we studied in kmrsw and kmr . with proper choices we indeed get a reection positivity for such analogs of laplace operators with the proof following closely the ideas in jr . date: january , klimek and mcbride when working with noncommutative algebras, we tried to make our constructions as geometrical as possible. every step was carefully motivated by the corresponding classical geometry concepts and their noncommutative versions. the paper is organized as follows. in section we review the quantum cylinder and dis- cuss its geometric hilbert space constructed from an invariant weight playing the role of the lebesgue measure. we also discuss the reection operator necessary for the reection positivity for the laplace-type operators we consider. in section we classify all unbounded derivations on the quantum cylinder that arise from the dense subalgebra considered in sec- tion finally in section we show how to implement those derivations which are invariant and covariant and create laplace-type operators from those implementations. moreover we prove the reection positivity for such a class of laplace-type operators.","The text discusses the study of unbounded derivations in quantum domains, focusing on laplace-type operators and spectral triples associated with them. It was influenced by previous work on reflection positivity for laplace operators in different settings. The aim is to extend these concepts to noncommutative geometry, particularly on noncommutative manifolds like the quantum cylinder. By using rotationally covariant unbounded derivations, laplace-type operators with reflection positivity can be constructed. The paper emphasizes making constructions as geometrical as possible in the noncommutative algebra context, following classical geometry concepts. The organization of the paper covers a review of the quantum cylinder, classification of unbounded derivations, and implementation of these derivations to create laplace-type operators with reflection positivity."
"in this section we describe the structure and the geometry of the noncommutative cylinder, which is dened here as a concrete calgebra of operators in to introduce it we need some notation. let {ek} be the canonical basis for and let u be the bilateral shift, i.e. uek = ek+ we use the diagonal label operator: kek = kek, so that, for a bounded function a : z c, we can write: aek = aek. in a sense the operators u, k are noncommutative polar coordinates. we have the following crucial commutation relation for a diagonal operator a: a u = ua. commrel let c be the space of convergent sequences, and consider the abelian algebra: adiag = {a : {a} c} . we dene the quantum cylinder as the calgebra generated by u and the above diagonal operators: a = c. because of formula ( commrel ), we can view the quantum cylinder as the group crossed product of adiag with z acting on adiag via shifts , that is: a = adiag shift z. also, we see that is a cartan pair r . alternatively, the quantum cylinder can be described as a singly generated calgebra. consider the following special weighted bilateral shift: urek =  rek+ k < ek+ k , < r < we have that a = c, the unital calgebra generated by ur, kmrs . additional arguments in references kl , km , and kmrs further justify that this noncommutative derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder calgebra is an appropriate choice to be called the quantum cylinder. its structure can be described by the following short exact sequence: k a c c , where k is the ideal of compact operators in which, in fact, is the commutator ideal of the algebra a. as in kmr , we call a function a : z c eventually constant, if there exists a natural number k such that a are constants for |k| k the constants are denoted by a. the set of all such functions will be denoted by c let pol(ur, u r ) be the set of all polynomials in ur and u r . alternatively, we have a natural dense algebra of algebraic elements of a dened as: a = ( a = x n unan : a c , nite sum ) . it was proved in kmr that a = pol(ur, u r ), which allows us to work with the unitary u and diagonal operators, as dealing with ur is more dicult. in fact, we have the following useful identication. useful_gens proposition . a is equal to the algebra of polynomial generated by u, u, p, and p, where p is the orthogonal projection onto span{e}, while p is the orthogonal projection onto span{ek, k }. proof. this identication immediately follows from the the denition of a and the following decomposition of diagonal elements of a: a = x kk a + x k<k<k aunpun + x kk ap, valid for a c rotational symmetry on a can be introduced in the following way. for each [, ), let : a a be an automorphism dened by ) = a and = eiu, for a diagonal operator a. it is well dened on all of a because it preserves the relation ( commrel ). alternatively, the action of can be written down using the label operator k as: = eikaeik. it follows that : a a. notice also that we have the identications: adiag :=  a : {a} c = {a a : = a}, and similarly adiag = {a : {a} c} = {a a : = a}. the algebra a also has a reection symmetry that can be dened on the generators via = u and ) = a. little_the we will verify below that extends to an anti-homomorphism : a a, thus equipping the whole quantum cylinder with a natural reection. additionally, preserves the dense subalgebra a. klimek and mcbride a natural analog of the classical space of square-integrable functions on the cylinder is the following gns hilbert space h for a with respect to the weight a tr, which in turn is the analog of the lebesque measure on the classical cylinder. it is the completion of the algebra a with respect to the norm a = tr for a a. explicitly, we can view h in the following way: h = ( f = x nz unfn : x n,kz |fn| < ) . hdef_ref the hilbert space h carries natural representations of a. let : a b be the representation of a in the bounded operators of h given by left multiplication: f = af, where a a and f h. we also need : a b given by: f = fa. then the map is a continuous - homomorphism and is a continuous - preserving anti-homomorphism. both maps have trivial kernel. let d be the following subspace of h: d = n f = x unfn : fn c, nite sum o . ddef_ref notice that d is dense in h and a straightforward calculation shows that the representations and preserve d. the subspace is a natural domain for unbounded operators considered in later sections. the symmetries of a can be implemented in h as follows. for the rotations, if [, ), we dene u : h h by the formula: uf = x nz uneinfn. it follows from the denitions that we have u = d and uu = ). the implementation of reection on h is given by the following operator : h h given by the formula: = x nz unfn ! = x nz fnun = x nz unfn. theta_deco the relevant properties of are summarized in the following propositions. proposition . the operator : h h satises = i and is a self-adjoint operator. proof. the statements follow from direct calculations. if f h, we have: = x nz unfn ! = x nz un n) = x nz unfn. derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder thus = i. similarly, if f, g h we have: , g= tr g) = tr x nz f nun x mz umgm ! = x n,kz f ngn, where we used the fact that the trace is nonzero if and only if n = m. next, changing variables by sending k k n and resumming, we obtain: , g= x n,kz f ngn = tr x nz f nun x mz umgm ! = f, , which completes the proof. the interplay between representations , and lets us extend the map dened on generators in ( little_theta ) to an anti-homomorphism on all of a. nti_on_gens proposition . we have = and ) = ). consequently, there is an anti-homomorphism : a a such that = ) for all a a. proof. the rst part of the proposition follows from calculations. for f h we have: = x nz un+fn !

"the purpose of this section is to give a description of unbounded derivations in a dened on a. one can think of derivations as noncommutative analogs of vector elds, and they will be used in the next section as building blocks in constructing quantum laplace-like operators. analogous classication of derivations in the quantum disk, and in several other toeplitz- type algebras, was discussed in kmrsw and kmrsw , and similar decompositions were previously introduced in bej , h , and j , see also references therein. the key to understanding the structure of derivations in a is the following simple obser- vation. proposition . let d : a a be any derivation, then d : a k k. consequently d denes a derivation on equivalence classes: : a/k = c c. proof. notice that the projection p is in a k. applying the leibniz rule to p = p we get: d = pd + dp it follows that d is in k. but any element of ak is a nite sum of operators of the form unpum, and the leibniz rule again implies that the action of d on such elements results in a compact operator. we want to understand the properties of the correspondence d to describe its kernel we need the following concepts. any derivation d : a a that satises the relation d) = ein) will be referred to as a n-covariant derivation. we say that a function : z c has convergent increments, if the sequence of dierences { } is convergent i.e. { } c. the set of all such functions will be denoted by cinc. the following proposition classies all n-covariant derivations d : a a. var_der_rep proposition . if d is a n-covariant derivation d : a a, then there exists a function cinc, which is unique in n = and unique modulo an additive constant when n = , such that d = for a a. derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder proof. the proof is a slight extension of proposition in kmr , see also theorem of kmrsw . dening a linear map d : a a via the formula: d := und, we see from the covariance property of d that d : adiag adiag. additionally, d satises a twisted leibniz rule of the form: db) = d)b + a d). because adiag is commutative we have: db) = da), so the following relation follows: d) = d). we can now easily see, as in kmrsw , that there is a diagonal operator such that: d) = a), and the result follows. recall that d is called approximately inner if there are an a such that d = lim n for a a. inner_coef proposition . if d is a n-covariant derivation d : a a, then d is approximately inner if and only if { } c proof. full details of an analogous result for a class of more complicated examples is given in theorem of kmrsw , therefore we only give a brief outline here. if { } c then the corresponding derivation d = can be approximated by inner derivations dm = , where m are eventually constant and such that m m = for |k| m while m m = if |k| > m. on the other hand if a n-covariant derivation d = is approximately inner then we can arrange that it can be approximated by inner n-covariant derivations of the form dm = with m c. since {m m} c we also get { } c with this preparation we are ready to describe the kernel of the quotient map d theorem . let d : a a be any derivation. then = if and only if d is approxi- mately inner. proof. let d be approximately inner, then there exists an a such that d = lim n for all a a. it was shown in kmrs that k is the commutator ideal. thus k for all n and a a. since the norm limit of compact operators is compact, we have d k for all a a and hence = klimek and mcbride on the other hand, suppose = dene dn : a a via dn = z ein ) d. it can be readily checked that dn is the n-covariant component of d, thus by proposition n_covar_der_rep , there exists a sequence {n} such that dn = . if = then it easily follows that = since the operator dn = un+ n) is compact, it therefore follows that n) as k . then proposition approx_inner_coef implies that dn is approximately inner. notice that by the usual c esaro approximation argument, see kmrsw , kmrsw , we have: d = lim m dm, where dm = m + m x n= n x j=n dj. since all djs are approximately inner it follows that dm is approximately inner. consequently, there exists xm,j a such that for all a a we have: dm = lim j. recall the identication a = pol(ur, u r ) and so to check that d is approximately inner, we need only to verify convergence of inner approximations on ur and u r . given m, choose j such that: dm < m, and also such that the same condition holds for u r . then we claim that we have convergence: d = lim m, for all a a. notice that by the triangle inequality we can estimate: d d dm+ dm < + m < , as dm d as m . since the claim holds on ur, u r , d is linear and satises the leibniz rule, the claim holds for all a a, thus proving d is approximately inner. it should be noted that this type of argument only works since a is nitely generated. we also get the following immediate corollary. corollary . if d, d : a a are any two derivations such that = , then d d is approximately inner. derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder next we want to describe the range of the map d for this we notice that we can identify = pol pol in a/k = c c and we can easily classify all derivations : pol pol c. class_der proposition . if : cc is any derivation in cc then there exist functions f, g c such that = f,g :=  f i d dx, g i d dx  . dfgdef_ref proof. the result will follow if we show that if : pol c is any derivation then there exists a function f c such that = f i d dx. since pol is the algebra of trigonometric polynomials, a derivation is completely deter- mined by its action on the generator eix. consequently, there exist a continuous function f such that = feix, and it follows that is given by the formula above. it turns out that the range of the map d is the space of all derivations, i.e. any derivation : a/k can be lifted to a derivation d : a a. this kind of lifting problem is often the most dicult step in classication of derivations with respect to an ideal in the algebra. theorem . if f,g : c c is the derivation given by ( dfgdef_ref ), then there exists a derivation df,g : a a such that = f,g. proof. given any two continuous functions f and g, dene a toeplitz-like operator tf,g : c c a by the following formula: tf,g = pfp + p<gp<, see proposition useful_gens . by the continuous functional calculus, tf,g is well-dened and bounded, moreover tf,g a. first we prove the lifting result when f, g are trigonometric polynomials and then extend it to general continuous functions. for f, g pol dene the following operators: t + f,g = x n unt + n and t f,g = x n t n un, where the sums over n are nite and t + n = fn n, k > gn n, k else and t n = fn k , n gn k < , n > else, where fn and gn are the fourier coecients of f and g respectively. we dene a derivation df,g on a by df,g = [t + f,gk + kt f,g, a]. der_on_tri klimek and mcbride since df,g is dened through a commutator its clear that df,g satises the leibniz rule for derivations, thus the only items that must be checked is that df,g a for a a and = f,g. since a is generated by u, p, and p, we only need to check the conditions on those three generators. for u we have the following: df,g = = x n un+  t + n kt + n  + x n  kt n t n  un+ = up x n> unfnp + x n fnunp ! + up< x n ungnp< + x n> gnunp< ! = utf,g, where we used the denition of t n and the denition of the orthogonal projections. in particular, we have df,g a. a similar computation for a adiag gives the following general formula: df,g) = "" x n> unfn ! p>k, a # + "" x n ungn ! pk, a # + "" kp< x n> gnun ! , a # + "" kp x n fnun ! , a # . it is clear from the above formula that we have df,g = df,g = thus df,g is a well-dened derivation a a. finally we need to check that = f,g. the restriction to the boundary map = : a c c is dened by : a c with = eix and ) = a, where a are the limits of a at . the map is the factor homomorphism and we have = ) for all a a. from the denition of tf,g we have the formula: = , g), and, obviously, also ) = ) = consequently, we obtain: ) = = eix, geix) = f,g. therefore, for f, g pol, there exists a derivation df,g : a a such that = f,g. derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder next we consider arbitrary f, g c. we will dene df,g : a a by an approximation argument. there exist sequences {fm}, {gm} pol such that fm, gm converge to f, g in c respectively. for any a a we want to dene df,g as the limit: df,g = lim mdfm,gm, where dfm,gm were dened in equation ( der_on_trig_poly ). such a limit exists because it exists on the generators u, p, and p of a. in fact, we have: df,g = lim mutfm,gm = utf,g, and similarly df,g = df,g = this completes the proof. notice that we could not have simply dened df,g by the above formulas on generators as it is not immediately clear that they unambiguously extend to a derivation on all of a. the following observation immediately follows from the above proof. corollary . for any f, g c there exists unique derivation df,g : a a such that: df,g = utf,g, df,g = df,g = moreover, = f,g where f,g : c c is given by f,g =  f i d dx, g i d dx  . putting together all of these results, we get the following classication theorem, which is the rst main result of this paper. theorem . let d : a a be any derivation. there are unique functions f, g c such that d = d + df,g, where d is an approximately inner derivation.","This section discusses the classification of derivations in the Quantum cylinder, aiming to describe unbounded derivations on a defined space. Derivations are considered as noncommutative analogs of vector fields and are important in constructing quantum Laplace-like operators. The classification is based on n-covariant derivations, convergent increments, and approximation by inner derivations. The section presents propositions and theorems to classify and understand derivations within the specified framework. The range of derivations is also described, highlighting the lifting problem in classifying derivations with respect to an ideal in the algebra. Various propositions and corollaries are presented to explain the classification of derivations based on different properties and functions. The main result of the section is a classification theorem stating that any derivation on the Quantum cylinder can be uniquely represented as an approximately inner derivation plus a certain derived derivation based on unique functions f and g."
"this section contains our main results on reection positivity of laplace-type operators constructed using special kind of derivations described and classied above. any derivation d : a a that satises the relation: ) = d) will be referred to as a -invariant derivation. similarly, any derivation d : a a that satises the relation d) = ei) for all a a will be referred to as a -covariant derivation. those are special cases of n-covariant derivations from the previous section, corresponding to n = and n = respectively. in order to construct interesting, geometrical laplace-type operators we want to implement such derivations as operators in the hilbert space h dened in ( hdef_ref ). in kmrsw and kmr , the invariant and covariant derivations were easily implementable because the representation of the algebra in the hilbert space considered in those papers had a cyclic vector. in the present situation this is no longer the case, thus we need a new argument to show that the invariant klimek and mcbride and covariant derivations can be implemented us unbounded operators on domain d dened in ( ddef_ref ). the following proposition gives a description of such invariant and covariant implementa- tions and uses an approximate identity argument. r_implement proposition . let d : a a, d = , be an invariant derivation in a. then there exists a densely-dened operator d : d h such that f = )f, for f d, a a and udu f = df for f d. moreover there exists a sequence such that the implementation has the following form: df = f f. let d : a a, d = , be a covariant derivation in a. then there exists a densely-dened operator d : d h such that f = )f, for f d, a a and udu f = eidf for f d. moreover there exists a sequence such that the implementation has the following form: df = uf fu. proof. both parts have almost identical proofs; we will concentrate below on the covariant case. observe that we have a natural decomposition: h = m nz hn, hdecomp where hn := ( f = unfn : x kz |fn| < ) . this is precisely the spectral decomposition for u as we have u : hn hn and u|hn = eini. we have analogous subspace decomposition: d = l nz dn with dn hn. suppose d is an implementation of a covariant derivation as in the statement of the proposition. given f hn, we compute: u = eid = eidf, implying that d : dn hn+ consider the following characteristic function: n =  for |k| n otherwise. derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder then n d and so there exists n hn such that d) = un. since for n m we have nm = n, applying d to both sides we obtain: d)m) = d), and therefore m + nd) = d). using the properties of d we obtain the following relation: ))m + num = un, or equivalently: u n) + unm = un. it follows from the above equation, and the denition of n, that if n k, k + n, we have: m = n for every m > n. thus, if we x k, then n n is eventually constant and hence the following limit exists: = lim nn. given f d choose n large enough such that fn = f and n = . such a choice can be made since f has nite support. then, we obtain the following formula: df = d) = n + d) = )n + fun = ) + fu = uf fu ), as in the statement of the proposition. conversely, for any sequence the formula df = uf fu clearly denes an operator d : d h implementing the derivation d = , completing the proof. . reection positivity: invariant case. we describe here the easier of two interest- ing reection positivity results. let d : a a, given by d = , be an invariant derivation. we proved in proposition der_implement that such a derivation can be implemented by a densely-dened operator d, : d h given by: d,f = )f )f = x nz un )fn. if and are real then the operator d, is symmetric and, instead of constructing a laplace-type operator, we can work with d, directly. if = for all j, k z, then it is clear that d, is an invertible operator and we have the following formula for its inverse: d ,f = x nz un )fn. klimek and mcbride part of the reection positivity scheme is that the implementation d, has to be invariant with respect to : d, = d,. when this happens is the subject of the following proposition. proposition . with the above notation we have that d, is a - invariant implemen- tation of an invariant derivation d if and only if = for all k z. proof. using proposition morph_anti_on_gens , we get: d, = ) ) = ) ) = d, it follows that if d, = d, we have to have for all f d: + )f = f + ). choosing f = unn and varying n and n we conclude that we have to have the following relation for every k: + = const. this nishes the proof as, given d, the sequence is determined up to additive constant. in light of this proposition, we will now label the - invariant implementation by d, which is given by the formula d = ) + ), or, equivalently, df = x nz un + )fn for f h. the following is the reection positivity inequality in the invariant case. theorem . if > for all k z, then d is invertible and for all f h+ we have: f, d proof. the proof of the theorem is computational and it is simplied by the fact that the implementation operator d is diagonal. intriguingly, like in the continuous case, the left- hand side of the inequality can be expressed as an integral over the boundary, i.e. the reection invariant subset n + k = of z the inner product in the inequality can be separated into three parts as follows: f, d = x n,kz f n + )fn = x n+k< + x n+k=

theta_h_plus_h_minus we have fn = on n + k > , hence the sum over n + k > is zero. consequently we have f, d = x n+k= f n+)fn = x neven fn  n  n  . reection positivity: covariant case. as in the invariant case, let d : a a given by d = , be a covariant derivation in a. its implementations, according to proposition der_implement , are operators d, : d h given by: d,f = uf fu = x nz un+fn fn), or equivalently: d, = ) ). we now request invariance of the laplacian operator: d ,d, = d ,d,. the conditions for this to be true are described in the next statement. proposition . with the above notation we have d ,d, = d ,d, if and only if = for all k z. proof. using properties of and we obtain the following formula for the adjoint of d,: d , = u) u) . a simple calculation yields a formula for the corresponding laplacian: d ,d, = |) u)) u)) + |) . using proposition morph_anti_on_gens we obtain: d ,d, = |) )u) )u) . when comparing terms of d ,d, and d ,d, we need the following observation. lemma . if all a, a, b and b are not identically zero, and we have: afb = afb for all f d, then there is a nonzero constant such that a = a and b = b for all k z. proof. substituting f = unn we conclude that we have to have: ab = ab klimek and mcbride for all k, l z. notice that, since all the sequences are not identically zero, the above equation implies that a = if and only if a = , and similarly, b = if and only if b = now choose l such that b = and b = and dene to be: = b b, and the result immediately follows. applying the lemma we see that d ,d, = d ,d, is true if and only if there is a constant c such that with have the following equalities for all k: || = || = = . this is satised if and only if || = and = . therefore, we have = , which completes the proof. it turns out that only = + results in reection positivity for the corre- sponding laplacian and this is the option we consider below. the implementation of the covariant derivation from now on will be denoted by d. we have the following formula: d = ) u). it follows from a simple calculation that d satises: d = d. the following is the second main result of this paper, reection positivity for a class of quite non-trivial laplace-type operators coming from covariant derivations. _pos_covar theorem . let m be a positive number. for all f h+, we have the inequality: f,  d + m f proof. since all objects in the inequality are rotationally invariant, the rst step is to decom- pose them into components in each spectral subspace of u. intriguingly, the components of the laplacian are the usual jacobi operators t , which in our case are typically un- bounded, self-adjoint, two-step dierence operators. similarly to calculations in jr we show that the left-hand side of the inequality can, essentially, be written as a sum of terms over the reection invariant subset n + k = in z some of those terms in turn come, by a similar procedure, from manifestly positive inner products as demonstrated by lemma pos_bndy . to contrast it with classical case, integration by parts/stokes theorem are replaced by more complicated discrete versions. recall from ( hdecomp ) that we have the following spectral decomposition h = l nz hn and we can naturally identify hn = for each n z. given f d we have the corresponding decomposition of the laplacian: d df = x nz un derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder where =  || + || fn fn fn, and so we can write: d d = m nz n. similarly, we also have the decomposition of the reection operator = l nz n, where = f for f it follows that we get h = l nz h n , where h+ n = {f : fn = , for n + k < }. consequently, for any positive number m, we have the following formula: f, (d d + m)f= x nz nfn, fn, which implies that f, (d d + m)f if and only if for every n z, nfn, fn we will now concentrate on proving the above inequality. the rst goal is to express the left-hand side of it as boundary terms. this is done in two steps. let f h+ n and we set: g = f. using n : h+ n h n , we get the following : nf, f= x kz fg = x n+k fg = x n+k gg = x n+k | + || + m)gg x n+k  gg gg  . substituting k k and k k + in the last two terms of the above equation and resumming, we arrive at the following expression: nf, f= x n+k | + || + m)gg x n+k gg x n+k gg. klimek and mcbride there are two cases that will be addressed separately: n even and n odd. if n is even we have nf, f= x n+k gg +  n  + m  g  n  n  n  g  n  g  n  n  n  g  n  g  n  =  n  + m  g  n  , where we used the fact that f = g, and f = for n + k < we denoted the two boundary conjugate terms by x and x respectively, with x = n  n  g  n  g  n  . xdefref if n is odd, a similar calculation to the above results in the following formula: nf, f= n  g  n  g n  ! . to prove positivity we need the following observation that relates boundary terms of the type we encountered above with manifestly positive sums over bigger regions. pos_bndy lemma . for f h+ n let g = f and consider two nonnegative sums: = x n+k< |g g| + m x n+k< |g| = x n+k< |g g| + m x n+k< |g| then we have the following formulas: = n  g  n  n  n  g  n  g  n  n even n  g  n  n  g  n  g n  n odd and = n  g  n  +  n  n  g  n  g  n  n even n  g n  + n  g n  g  n  n odd proof. we prove only the formula for in the statement above as the proof of the formula for is virtually identical. first we split the summation as follows: = x n+k< ||gg + x n+k< ||gg + m x n+k< gg x n+k< gg x n+k< gg. derivations and reflection positivity on the quantum cylinder by substituting k k in the second and fth sum and resumming we get = x n+k< ||gg + x n+k< ||gg + m x n+k< gg x n+k< gg x n+k< gg. rearranging the terms we obtain: = x n+k< gg + x n+k= ||gg + x n+k= ||gg x n+k= gg x n+k= gg. since g = f and f h+ n , we have g = f = for n + k < therefore, is equal to the four remaining boundary terms in the above equation and depending on whether n is even or odd, the result follows. notice that the formula for for even n in lemma pos_bndy implies that x from ( xdefref ) is real and so we must have x = x. therefore, if n is even we have: nf, f=  n  x  g  n  + m x n+k= |g| = + m x n+k= |g| if we set y = n  g  n  g n  , then by either the formula for or for for odd n in lemma pos_bndy , we again have that the quantity y is real and consequently we have y y = thus, we obtain the following expression for odd n: nf, f= n  g  n  g n  ! +y y = + putting both cases together yields the following formulas: nf, f= + m x n+k= |g| n even + n odd, which are manifestly nonnegative. this completes the proof.","The section discusses reflection positivity of Laplace-type operators constructed using special derivations. These operators are categorized as -invariant or -covariant depending on certain relations they satisfy. To construct interesting operators in the Hilbert space, a new argument is needed due to lack of a cyclic vector representation. The section provides a proposition describing the implementation of invariant and covariant derivations as unbounded operators and uses an approximate identity argument for proof. Reflection positivity for both invariant and covariant cases is explored, with detailed calculations and proofs provided. The results show how such derivations can be implemented as operators on the domain, leading to reflection positivity inequalities and the implementation of Laplace-type operators."

"a fano variety x is said to be birationally superrigid if every birational map f : x k y from x to the source of a mori ber space is an isomorphism (see e.g. for an introduction). in particular, such fano varieties are not rational. this property identies a very special class of fano varieties and an interesting question is whether the set of birationally superrigid fano varieties form a nice moduli. indeed, it follows from the denition that x has terminal singularities and therefore by the seminal work of birkar on the borisov-alexeev-borisov conjecture, birationally superrigid fano varieties belong to a bounded family. moreover, such moduli satises the valuative criterion of separatedness by a recent result of stibitz and the author . in addition, birational superrigidity is a constructible condition by . so the next step is to check whether birational superrigidity is a locally closed property or not. unfortunately the answer is no in general, and one of the main purposes of this note is to construct such counterexamples. we remark that the stronger expectation that birational superrigidity is open in moduli is known to be false, at least in dimension three: one such counterexample is given by the family of quasi-smooth quintic hypersurfaces in p . the analogous openness question for birational rigidity (a weaker notion than birational superrigidity) also has a negative answer by the -dimensional counterexample in . in both examples, birational rigidity is a locally closed property in the corresponding moduli. our construction is based on the degeneration of hypersurfaces into double covers. let m be a suciently large integer and let x, , xn+, y be the weighted homogeneous coor- dinates of p. let fs, gs be homogeneous polynomials in x, , xn+ of degree m and m respectively so that x = p a s,t denes a family of weighted complete intersections of dimension n parameterized by a for t = , it is easy to see that xs,t = (tfs g s = ) pn+ is a hypersurface of degree m while xs, is the double cover of the hypersurface gs = pn+ branched over ziquan zhuang the divisor fs gs where fs = . we show that with suitable choices of fs and gs, this provides the counterexample we want in every suciently large odd dimension. theorem . notation as above. let x pn+ assume that n = m , m and the following: f and g have a unique ordinary singularity at x with multxf = m and multxg = m and are otherwise smooth, the projective tangent cone of f g at x is a smooth complete intersection, xs,t is smooth when s = then xs,t is birationally superrigid if and only if s = or = . the study of the birational superrigidity of xs,t in the above example can be further divided into two parts. we rst prove the birational superrigidity of smooth double covers of fano index by generalizing the multiplicity bound in the complete intersection case . indeed we prove something stronger: theorem . fix r, s z, then there exists an integer m such that every smooth weighted complete intersection x p of codimension r and index one )) with a base-point-free anticanonical linear system | kx| is birationally superrigid and k-stable when m m. we refer to for the denition of k-stability in the above statement. in our cases, k-stability is a direct consequence of the birational superrigidity by a simple application of . note that theorem generalizes the results of by allowing more general weighted complete intersections and removing the generality assumptions . next we handle singularities that may appear on x a). to do so we resolve the singularities by weighted blowups and analyze the maximal singularities on the resolution. as an illustration and application of this technique, we generalize a result of and prove an optimal result about the birational rigidity and k-stability of index hypersurfaces with ordinary singularities in large dimension: theorem . let x pn+ be a hypersurface of degree n + and dimension n with only isolated ordinary singularities of multiplicities at most m. then x is k-stable if m n; x is birationally superrigid if m n ; x is birationally rigid if m n moreover, linear projection from each point x x of multiplicity n induces a birational involution x and the birational automorphism group bir of x is generated by aut together with these x. this paper is organized as follows. birational superrigidity can be characterized by the singularities of movable boundaries and its openness is closely related to the semi- continuity of higher codimensional alpha invariants recently introduced by , thus in we study some properties of these invariants which may be of independent interest. theorems and are proved in and respectively. in , we prove theorem and present a few further questions. finally in the appendix, we prove that the alpha invariant function is constructible in some special cases. birational superrigidity is not a locally closed property notation and conventions. we work over c. unless otherwise specied, all varieties are assumed to be normal and divisors are understood as q-divisor. a boundary on a variety x is dened as an expression of the form am where a q and m is a linear system on x . it is said to be movable if m is movable . a pair consists of a variety x and an eective divisor x such that kx +is q-cartier. the notions of terminal, canonical, klt and log canonical singularities are dened in the sense of . let be a pair and m a q-cartier boundary on x, the log canonical threshold of m with respect to is denoted by lct (or simply lct when = ). acknowledgement. the author would like to thank his advisor j anos koll ar for con- stant support, encouragement and numerous inspiring conversations. he also wishes to thank hamid ahmadinezhad, ivan cheltsov, takuzo okada, jihun park and vyacheslav v. shokurov for helpful discussions and for pointing out several useful references and asher auel, yuchen liu and ziwen zhu for helpful conversations.","Fano varieties that are birationally superrigid have terminal singularities, belong to a bounded family, and satisfy the valuative criterion of separatedness.

"in this section, we study properties of higher codimensional alpha invariants and con- struct examples to show that they are not lower semi-continuous in general. this is of independent interest and the results are not used until the end of the note, so readers who are mainly interested in the proof of our main theorems may feel free to skip this section. denition . let be a klt pair and l an ample line bundle on x. let k n = dim x be an integer. we dene the alpha invariant of codimension k for to be = inf m m where m , the m-th alpha invariant of codimension k, is dened as the inmum of lct(x, ; mm) over all sub linear systems m |ml| whose base locus has codimension at least k. in particular, when k = this reduces to tians alpha invariant and when x is q-fano , = and l = kx (the denition of alpha invariants also makes sense when l is only a q-line bundle), this reduces to [zhu, denition ] and in this case we denote by . it is also not hard to see that the inmum in can be replaced by taking the limit. we note that this convergence m is actually uniform in any given family: proposition . let n, r > be integers and let , > then there exists an integer m depending only on n, r, and with the following property: for any klt pair and any ample line bundle l such that x has dimension n, rl is globally generated, rl is ample and < , we have m + for all k n and all m m. ziquan zhuang proof. the argument is essentially the same as , and we reproduce the proof for readers convenience. let k n and let = . it is clear from the denition that , thus < by assumption. again by denition, there exists an integer and a linear system m |l| whose base locus has codimension at least k such that lct(x, ; m) + let e be an exceptional divisor over x that computes lct(x, ; m) and let a = a + be the log discrepancy of e with respect to the pair , then we have orde( m) a + and hence ordej (x, + m m) orde(m m) a > orde(m m) a a m + . where j (x, + m m) denotes the multiplier ideal of the pair. since rl is ample and m m q ml, we have hi(x, j (x, + m m) oxl)) = by nadel vanishing. as rl is globally generated, we see that j (x, + m m)oxl) is also globally generated by castelnuovo-mumford regularity . note that the co-support of j (x, + m m) has codimension at least k since the same is true for the base locus of m. therefore, m = |j (x, + m m) oxl)| denes a sub linear series of |l| whose base locus has codimension at least k and from the previous calculations we have m+n+nr lct(x, ; m + n + nrm) a ordej (x, + m m) < m + r + nr m ( + ) it is clear that there exists m depending only on n, r, and such that the last term of the above inequality is smaller than + whenever m m and < . replacing m by m + r + nr, it follows that m < + for all k n and m m. corollary . let f : t be a q-gorenstein at family of klt pairs (in the sense of e.g. ) and let l be an f-ample line bundle on x. let > then there exists an integer m > such that m for all m m and t t. proof. since l is f-ample, we may choose r z> such that rlt is very ample and rl is f-ample for all t t. it is then not hard to see that nr since for any smooth point x xt\t, the linear system m = |rlt mx| is base birational superrigidity is not a locally closed property point free outside x and lct = n. the result then follows from proposition by taking = nr + in particular, as the function t m on t is lower semi-continuous for each m , we obtain the lower semi-continuity of the alpha invariant function [bl, theorem b]. in contrast, the higher codimensional variants are in general not lower semi-continuous, as suggested by the following statement is the seshadri constant of l at a very general point; see for the denition and elementary properties of seshadri constants): proposition . let x be a smooth projective variety of dimension n and l an ample line bundle on x. then n n with equality if and only if = n p . remark . before we prove this proposition, let us explain why it leads to the failure of lower semi-continuity for higher codimensional alpha invariants. recall that we always have n p and the function t is lower semi-continuous in any polarized at family f : t. thus if f : x t is smooth and l is an f-ample line bundle such that = n p (ln t ) at very general t t while < n p (ln ) on some special ber x, then by the above proposition we have > n n p (ln ) = and therefore the function t is not lower semi-continuous. as a concrete example, let f : t be the family of k surfaces of degree , then a general member xt of this family has picard number one, hence = by [knu, corollary]; on the other hand, let x be a quartic k surface containing a line , let h be the hyperplane class and let c h be the class dening the elliptic bration, then l = h + c has degree but = < p . proof of proposition . we rst prove that m n a for all m , where a = n p , the inequality for then follows by taking the limit. let m |ml| be a linear system whose base locus supported on isolated points, then we can dene the complete intersection subscheme z = mn by choosing n general member of m. we claim that lct n ma. indeed, let x x, then we have multxz = = mnan, hence by we have lctx n ma (lctx denotes the log canonical threshold at the point x) for all x and the claim follows. we then have lct lct n ma and as m is arbitrary, we obtain m n a. suppose that = a, then there exists x x such that = a and by denition, l te is ample for all < t < a (where : y x is the blowup of x at x with exceptional divisor e). it follows that for t q and suciently large and divisible m , the linear system mm,t = |m| = |ml mmt x | |ml| is base point free away from x and we get m lct m n mt = n t . letting t a we see that n a. since we always have the inequality in the other direction, we obtain the equality = n a. now suppose that = n a. then by denition, for each < , there exist some m together with some linear system m |ml| with isolated base points such ziquan zhuang that lct(x, mm) < n a + let i be base ideal of m (i.e. image of the evaluation map m lm ox), then we have lctx < n a + for some x x and multxi mn = mnan. in particular, lctxn multxi nn for some < . by lemma , this implies i mm x (i.e. inclusion holds after raising both sides to a suciently divisible power) for some < (which again depends on ) and in particular, multxm m and since m only has isolated base points we have = m multxc for any curve c containing x. by denition of seshadri constants, this gives = inf xc multxc a . since can be arbitrarily small, we obtain a. but we always have a, thus equality holds as well. the following lemma is used in the above proof. lemma . let q+, then there exists some > such that for every smooth variety x of dimension n and every ideal i ox co-supported at a point x x such that lctn multx nn, we have i mn x where = lct. proof. the argument is similar to those of . we may replace i by ifor some suciently divisible and assume that z. since the statement is local, we may also assume that x = an and x is the origin. in particular, we consider i as an ideal in r = c. let m = mx. choose a multiplicative order on the monomials in r and deform all powers im of i to monomial ideals in, then in in in and we have im mif and only if in m(for any m, n). as in , let = lct, let p) rn be the newton polytope of in and let p= rn r p). then by and the lower semi- continuity of lct, = lim r ) r where = inf{t > | p}. let f = (pn i= aiui = ) be a sup- porting hyperplane of pthrough the point and let sf = {u rn | pn i= aiui }. then sf and we have multx = lim r n! n = lim r n! ) n n!vol n y i= ai . by assumption, multx n, hence qn i= ai n, or n y i= ai  n n pn i= ai n n . comparing with the am-gm inequality, we see that if > is chosen to be suciently small , then we have ai n pn i= ai n. it follows that ) := {u rn | pn i= ui n} sf rn \p;

The alpha invariant of codimension k for a klt pair and ample line bundle on X is defined as the infimum of certain linear systems over all sub linear systems whose base locus has codimension at least k. While the lower semi-continuity property holds for alpha invariants in general, it fails for higher codimensional variants. Examples are provided to illustrate this point, emphasizing the nuances in the behavior of these invariants."

"in this section we prove theorem . the proof is a bit lengthy, so we divide it into several steps. throughout the section, x always denotes a hypersurface of degree n + and dimension n with only isolated ordinary singularities. we rst treat the rigidity of x. lemma . let x x be a point of multiplicity m n and let : y x be the blowup of x at x with exceptional divisor e. let m q kx be a movable boundary and let m be its strict transform on y . then (y, m) is canonical along e. proof. we start with some multiplicity estimate. by assumption, e pn is a smooth hypersurface of degree m let z be the codimension cycle m in y . note that by , we have multym outside a nite union of surfaces, hence multyz away from e and another set of dimension at most decompose z into z = z + z such that the irreducible components of z is contained (resp. not contained) in e. we may view z as a divisor in e and since e has picard number birational superrigidity is not a locally closed property one, there exists some b > such that z q b c) q be by [puk, proposition ] , we have multyz b outside a nite number of points. let c = ordem, then we have m q mce, z q h+ce and z = z z q h + e let w = z e, then w q e and as a codimension cycle in e we have w q c) , hence by [puk, proposition ] again we see that multyw c + b outside a nite union of curves in e. on the other hand, as h e is a nef line bundle on y , we have bm = z n z n = m n = n + cm, hence b c + b n+ m and as m n and n by assumption, we obtain multyz m < outside a subset v of dimension at most in y (at least in a neighbourhood of e; the same remark applies to the other claims about singularities in this proof). in particular, if y y \v and s is a general surface section in y containing y, then by , (s, m|s) is klt at y and thus by inversion of adjunction, (y, m) is klt away from v . we also need to show that (y, m) has canonical singularities away from v . let y e\v and let k e be a center of maximal singularity containing y. if k has codimension at least in y then by adjunction (s, m|s) is not lc at y where s is a general surface section in y containing y, but from the above discussion (s, m|s) is klt at y, a contradiction. thus k has codimension in y and is a divisor in e is already canonical outside a nite union of curves, see the proof of ) and we have multk m > it follows that b > and c > , but c + b n+ m < , a contradiction. thus (y, m) has canonical singularities away from v . the rest of the proof is similar to those in . let y e, let y be a complete intersection in y cut out by three general hypersurfaces in |h e| containing y and let m = m|y . then is klt away from y and it is not hard to verify that for l = h + e, l (ky + m) is nef and big. by and lemma , we see that is lc as long as h n but since is a complete intersection in pn, we have h h) n +  and then it is not hard to see that holds when n therefore is lc and since dim v , (y, m) is canonical by . the following lemma is used in the above proof. lemma . let x be a smooth variety of dimension n and x x. let > , then nlc > n proof. this follows directly from and the proof of [zhu, lemma a.]. we are ready to prove the birational rigidity part of theorem . ziquan zhuang proof of theorem . let m q kx be a movable boundary. suppose that is not canonical at some point x x with multiplicity m by [lz, theorem ], has canonical singularities outside points of multiplicity at most n in particular, is canonical in a punctured neighbourhood of x and we have m n let : y x be the blowup of x, let m be the strict transform of m and let e be the exceptional divisor. by lemma , (y, m) has canonical singularities, thus as is not canonical, e must be a center of maximal singularity and we obtain a = n m ordem < as m is movable and h e is nef , we have ( m n) and hence m < m deg x = n + , which can only be true when m = n it follows that the only possible maximal singularity of x is the ordinary blowup of a point of multiplicity n by standard argument , this proves parts and of theorem . next we show that x is k-stable when all points have multiplicity at most n by , it suces to show that > and that in case x has multiplicity n at some point x, is lc at x for every movable boundary m q kx (using a modication of the above argument). lemma . let x x be a point of multiplicity m n , then is lc at x for every movable boundary m q kx and (x, d) is klt at x for every eective divisor d q kx. proof. as before let : y x be the blowup of of x with exceptional divisor e and let m be the strict transform of m. from the above proof of lemma and theorem , we see that is indeed canonical at x if m n hence we may assume that m = n we have ky + m + e = where c = ordem and as before since m n , we obtain c n+ m = + n (hence c < n) and multy m < n outside a set v of dimension at most we may assume that c > , otherwise is already canonical by lemma . by applied to a general surface section of e) containing some y y \v as before (noting that multy m ( )), we nd that (y, ) is lc away from v (where = e + m) and the same argument as before (i.e. using and lemma ) implies that lct(y ; ) along e. in particular, (y, m + e) is lc along e and is lc at x as desired. similarly, let e d be the strict transform of d on y , then e d q h ae for some a n+ m (as e d n ) and multy e d n+ m outside a set v of dimension at most (by bounding the degree of e d|e and using ). if m n then by the proof of , (x, d) is klt at x. if m n , then by the above multiplicity estimate (y, e d) is klt away from v for some > and a similar argument as before involving and lemma (this time applied to = ) implies that lct(y ; e d) and thus (y, e d) is klt along e. since a(e; x, d) = n m a a > , (x, d) is also klt at x. birational superrigidity is not a locally closed property finally we treat the case when some points of x has multiplicity n. for this we use the criterion and need to analyze the singularities of a few more auxiliary pairs. lemma . let d q kx be an eective divisor and m q kx a movable boundary. then (x, nd + n n m) is lc over the smooth locus of x. proof. let = nd + n n m and let c = we rst show that is lc outside a set of dimension at most by , we have multxd and multx away from a set z of dimension at most let s x be a general surface section containing a point x x\z, then its not hard to verify that c n multx + c n n  multx(m| s) c n + c  n  < , hence by the following lemma , is lc at x and therefore by inversion of adjunction we see that is lc away from z. now let y x be any smooth point and let y x be a general linear section of codimension containing y, then is lc in a punctured neighbourhood of y and l is ample where l = h|y . by and lemma , lct = c (in a neighbourhood of y) as long as h =  n+  n , which holds when n therefore, is lc at y and by inversion of adjunction is also lc at y. lemma . let s be a smooth surface and let x s. let d be an eective divisor on s. assume that multxd + multx then is lc at x. proof. let m be a suciently divisible integer such that md and mm are both integral. let be such that = lctx). by , we have multx + multx equivalently, m multx + m multx by assumption, this implies m. in other words, is lc at x. lemma . let v pn be a smooth fano hypersurface and let d q h be an eective divisor on v for some n . assume that is lc away from a nite number of points, then (x, nd) is lc. proof. by and lemma h and = n respectively), we have lct n as long as h =  n+n n  n since  n+m m  n+m for all n = m, the result follows. we are now ready to nish the proof of theorem . proof of theorem . let d q kx be an eective divisor on x and let m q kx be a movable boundary. we claim that (x, = n n+) is klt where = nd+ n n m. it then follows from that x is k-stable. as x has picard number one, we may assume that d is irreducible (being klt is pre- served under convex linear combination). let x x be a point of multiplicity m if ziquan zhuang m n , then by lemma , is lc at x and (x, d) is klt at x, hence as = n+ d + ( n+)m is a convex linear combination of d and m, we see that is klt at x. it remains to consider the case m = n. after a change of coordinate, we may assume that x = and the dening equation of x can be written as xn+fn + fn+ = where fi is homogeneous of degree i. let d = x. as before, let : y x be the blowup of x with exceptional divisor e and strict transforms e d, m, e d, and . suppose rst that d is not supported on d, then as before we have orded since e d e d n similarly ordem and thus = orde we claim that in a neighbourhood of e, is lc outside a nite number of point. by lemma , is lc in a punctured neighbourhood of x. thus as e appears with coecient at most in , by inversion of adjunction it suces to show that (e, |e) is lc outside a nite number of points. but as e is a smooth hypersurface in pn and |e q e|e q c) where , this follows from [puk, proposition ] and therefore is lc outside a nite number of point. by applied to with l = q and is nef and big) we obtain lct n n+ with equality if and only if multy = n + for some y y . but if such y exists, then clearly y e and since = + e where , we have multy( |e) multy n. recall that e is a smooth hypersurface of degree n and |e q c), we also have multy( |e) n n. hence we must have equality everywhere, in particular, = and multy m = multy( m|e) = n. but as m is movable, if we choose n general members p, , pn of |h e| passing through y and another general member q of |h e| containing y, then the intersection m p . . . pn q is zero dimensional and we get n + = deg e = ( m p . . . pn q) (multy m) = n, a contradiction. thus such y doesnt exist and we indeed have lct > n n+ in other words, ) is klt. it remain to treat the case when d is supported on d (i.e. d = nd). as ordem and orded = n+ n , we still have orde< since x = has only isolated singularities, a direct computation shows that e d|e = e has only isolated singularities as well. by lemma , (e, e d|e = n e d|e) is lc. on the other hand, as e is a smooth hypersurface of degree n in pn and m|e q c) where , we see that (e, n n m|e) is also lc by . taking convex linear combination = n+ e d|e + n n+ n n m|e, it follows that (e, |e) is lc and thus by inversion of adjunction (y, e + ) is lc as well. as is klt away from x, all the lc centers of (y, e + ) are contained in e, hence as orde< , we deduce that and are both klt and this nishes the proof.","The section discusses hypersurfaces with ordinary singularities, proving a theorem in multiple steps.

see, e.g., nite dierence methods , mixed and nonconforming nite element methods and fourier-spectral methods . in recent years, the discontinuous galerkin method has become popular for solving the cahn-hilliard equation, owing to its exibility in handling higher order derivatives, high-order accuracy, the property of lo- cal conservation which is crucial for applications in porous redmedium ow and transport phenomenon, high parallelizability and ease of achieving hp- adaptivity. applications of dg methods to fourth order elliptic problems have been considered by babu ska and zl amal in , by baker in , and more recently by mozolevski et al. in a series of works . in , feng and karakashian design and analyze a dg method of interior penalty type based on the fourth order formulation of the cahn-hilliard equation. opti- mal error estimates in various energy norms are established: see also . kay et al. propose and analyze a dierent dg method that treats the cahn-hilliard equation as a system of second order equations allowing a rel- atively larger penalty term. a fully adaptive version of the interior penalty dg method was recently constructed in for the cahn-hilliard equation with a source and optimal l error bound were derived; see also for solv- ing the advective cahn-hilliard equation. the local discontinuous galerkin method has also been proposed for the discretization of the cahn- hilliard equation by writing it as a system of four rst-order equations. dong and shu in analyzed an ldg scheme for general elliptic equations including the linearized cahn-hilliard equation and obtained optimal error estimate in l recently, an ldg method has been employed for solving a number of cahn-hilliard uid models, cf. . the dg method is however often criticized for the larger amount of de- grees of freedom compared to the continuous galerkin method . in the seminal work cockburn et al. propose a hybridizable discontinuous galerkin method for second order elliptic problems. in a nutshell, the hdg method maps the ux and solution into the numerical trace of the solution via a local solver, which are in turn connected by the continuity of uxes across inter-element boundaries . hence the globally coupled degrees of freedom are those numerical traces, resulting in a signicant reduction of the number of unknowns in traditional dg meth- ods. moreover, the hdg methods possess the same favorable properties as classical mixed methods. in particular, hdg methods provide optimal con- vergence rates for both the gradient and the primal variables of the mixed formulation. this property enables the construction of superconvergent so- lutions, contrary to other dg methods. these advantages of the hdg meth- ods have made hdg an attractive alternative for solving problems governed by pdes and pde control problems, see . most study currently focuses on establishing optimal and superconver- gent rates of hdg methods for second order problems, such as elliptic pdes , convection diusion equations , stokes equations , os- een equations and navier-stokes equations . however, in , the authors utilized an hdg method with polynomial degree k for all variables to investigate the biharmonic equations and obtained an optimal conver- gence rate for the solution and suboptimal convergence rates for the other variables. to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an hdg work that achieves optimal convergence rates for all variables for a fourth order problem. in this work, we propose a hdg method for the cahn-hilliard equa- tion with lehrenfeld-sch oberl stabilization function, polynomials of degree k + for the scalar unknown, and polynomials of degree k for the other unknowns. the hdg framework with reduced stabilization and polynomi- als of mixed orders was rst introduced by lehrenfeld in where it was alluded that the scheme could be a superconvergent method, i.e., o error estimates is expected for the solution variables even though polynomi- als of degree k are used for the globally coupled unknowns (numerical traces of the solution). optimal convergence and hence superconvergence was then rigorously established for convection diusion problems , navier-stokes equations , and more recently for linear elasticity problems . we provide the hdg formulation for the cahn-hilliard equation in section and prove the existence, uniqueness and stability of the hdg method in section in section , we perform a rigorous error analysis for the hdg method and obtain the following a priori error bounds for the solution , u and their uxes p = and q = u: t n x n= pn pn h l + t n x n= qn qn h l c, t n x n= n n h l + max nn un un h l c these convergence rates are further validated by numerical experiments in section a particular theoretical contribution of this article is the estab- lishment of a novel hdg sobolev inequality which is a useful tool in the numerical analysis of nonlinear problems.","The text introduces the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a fourth-order nonlinear parabolic equation used to model phase separation in binary alloys.

"an accurate description of the free energy plays a critical role in many physics-based models of materials systems. the euler-lagrange equations of stationary problems are obtained by requiring that the rst variational deriva- tive of the free energy functional vanish. in the example of elasticity, this leads to the equilibrium equation satised by the displacement eld . evolution corresponding author email address: krishna@umich.edu preprint submitted to elsevier may , arxiv:v may equations can also require rst variations of the free energy as inputs. for ex- ample, the variational derivatives of the free energy with respect to composition and order parameters dene the chemical potential elds used in phase eld dynamics . a related result is that the rst derivative of the free energy density function with respect to appropriate strain measures gives the conju- gate stress. second derivatives with respect to the temperature yield the heat capacity, those with respect to strains dene elasticities . high-delity evaluations of free energy density functions are attainable by a combination of atomic scale models (including quantum mechanics and various molecular models) and statistical mechanics. the use of such free energy density functions in the partial dierential equations of continuum physics at coarse- grained scales, such as in phase eld models, other mass and heat transport equations, and the equations of nonlinear elasticity is a rigorous, if classical approach to scale bridging. in principle, if highly accurate free energy density functions were available, quantitative predictivity would become accessible in a specialized but signicant spectrum of mechano-chemically driven phenomena, such as phase transformations, nonlinear and strain gradient elasticity. implementing these computations, however, can be challenging for a number of reasons. free energy data is often computed at individual points rather than as an analytic function directly. as such, it becomes necessary to use a tting process to create a faithful mathematical model of the free energy. the free energy density can be a function of multiple variables, including composition, temperature, strain, and order parameters, thus leading to a high-dimensional function . additionally, realistic data for the free energy can contain regions with rapid uctuations, along with other regions with very gradual slopes . finally, because of the importance of the derivatives of the free energy, it is desirable that the tting function be smooth. all of these considerations pose challenges to the tting technique. machine learning methods are readily applicable to this problem, and we specically consider deep neural networks . dnns have been suc- cessfully applied to problems with large numbers of inputs, such as rgb pixel values in an image , the log-power spectra of speech data , the congura- tional energy of multicomponent alloys , predicting precipitate morphologies and biomarkers for predicting human age , among numerous other ap- plications. because the activation functions used in dnns are generally global functions with one local feature, dnns are capable of capturing local phenom- ena without negatively aecting longer range attributes of the data. also, with the proper choice of activation functions, dnns are innitely dierentiable, thus allowing all necessary derivatives to be computed. one potential disadvantage of dnns is that they are not, in general, analyt- ically integrable. this is a particular challenge in the case of tting free energy data, because the free energy is often not directly measured or computed from atomic models and statistical mechanics. instead, the derivatives of the free energy are rst observed or computed, then inte- grated to nd the free energy of the system . such an approach is of particular importance in cases where the chemical po- tential representation must be integrated with respect to chemical variables to obtain the free energy density, whose derivatives with respect to strain then yield the stress for elasticity . in order to preserve as much information about the derivatives as possible, it is ideal to train directly to the derivative data itself, as opposed to a numerically integrated data set. this requires an alternate form of dnn that can be trained to derivative data, then analytically integrated to represent the free energy itself. we present such an approach in this work. in this rst presentation of our proposed framework, we consider the prob- lem of chemistry, postponing coupled problems for later communications. to demonstrate the method of training a dnn to derivative data of the free energy, we consider a simple binary substitutional alloy with b ordering on a bcc par- ent structure . the resulting free energy, as a function of composition and an order parameter, is then used in the cahn-hilliard and allen-cahn phase eld equations. in section , we present the form of an integrable deep neural network . section describes the b material system and the method of calculat- ing the chemical potential data via a combination of atomic scale and statistical mechanics computations. in this context, the idnn training to the chemical potential data and the resulting free energy dnn are shown in section . we describe the phase eld formulation in section and present the computa- tional results obtained using the dnn representation of the free energy. section describes a process for tting the chemical potential data using b-splines and compares the resulting t and phase eld simulation with those of the dnn. concluding discussions are presented in section","The accurate description of free energy is crucial for physics-based models of material systems. Variational derivatives of free energy are used to derive equilibrium equations and properties such as chemical potential, stress, heat capacity, and elasticities. High-fidelity evaluation of free energy density functions involves combining atomic scale models and statistical mechanics. Implementing computations with free energy data can be challenging due to the need for fitting processes to create mathematical models, especially when dealing with high-dimensional functions and regions of rapid fluctuations. Machine learning methods, specifically deep neural networks (DNNs), can be applied to address these challenges. DNNs are capable of capturing local phenomena while allowing for the computation of necessary derivatives. A proposed framework involves training DNNs directly to derivative data to represent the free energy. The approach is demonstrated with a binary substitutional alloy and phase field equations. The study also considers the use of B-splines for fitting chemical potential data and compares the results with DNN representations in phase field simulations."
"for a fully connected dnn, the following equations are commonly used to dene the activation value of unit i in layer , denoted here by a i: a i = f(z i) z i = b i + m x j= w i,ja j where b i is the bias, w i,j is the weight, m is the number of units in layer , and f is the activation function . in a dnn used for regression, the output yi is computed using the activation units from the nal layer without an activation function: yi = bn+ i + mn x j= w n+ i,j an j the dnn can be thought of as a function of inputs x, weights w , and biases b, i.e. y = y . training the dnn consists of optimizing the weights and biases to minimize the loss function for a given dataset {( x, y )}ndata = . the x features output n hidden layers, m units in layer y a= f t xk a m- a m a a a a a m- a m figure : schematic of a standard, fully connected deep neural network . in this instance, the output is a scalar. loss function is generally the mean square error for regression problems. we can represent this as follows: w , b = arg min w ,b mse  y x , y  where the sum over = , . . . ndata is implied in the denition of the mse. as argued in the introduction, it can be desirable to train a function with data describing the derivatives. while it is possible to train a standard dnn directly to the derivative data, there are at least two drawbacks. the rst is that the standard dnn cannot, in general, be analytically integrated to recover the originating function. furthermore, in the multidimensional case with multiple sets of partial derivative data, the trained standard dnns representing the partial derivatives would not necessarily be themselves the derivatives of the same function. this inconsistency poses a problem even in situations where mathematical representations of only the partial derivatives are needed and not the integral itself. both of these diculties can be overcome by dierentiating the standard dnn with respect to the desired input variables, say xk with k = , . . . , n, then training these dierentiated functions to the derivative data {( x, yk)}, as represented by the following: w , b = arg min w ,b n x k= mse y xk x , yk  the functional form that results from dierentiating the standard dnn is, of course, analytically integrable. as such, it will be referred to in this work as an idnn . the antiderivative of the idnn is simply a standard dnn with the weights and biases of the trained idnn. the idnn has the following form: a i xk = f (z i) z i xk a i = f(z i) z i xk = m x j= w i,j a j xk where z i is given by equation . in a slightly more abstracted form with two sets of activation units, and k, we have: ki = f (z i) m x j= w i,j kj i = f(z i) the values of the trained derivative function yi,k := yi/xk and its integral yi are found as follows: yi,k = mn x j= w n+ i,j n kj yi = mn x j= w n+ i,j an j note that the following are used to compute the activation values for the rst hidden layer: ki = f (z i )w i,k z i = b i + m x j= w i,jxj i = f(z i ) the activation function, f, can be chosen such that its derivative, f , is also a common activation function. for example, with the softplus activation function, f := ln, the derivative, f is the commonly used logistic function, i.e. f = /. we emphasize that the form of the idnn in eq. has been chosen such that its integral has the form of a standard dnn, where both the idnn and its integral use the same weights and biases, as is clear from the optimizations and . thus, once the weights and biases of an idnn have been trained using , the analytically integrated dnn is constructed by simply using the idnns weights and biases in a standard dnn given by and .","A Fully connected Deep Neural Network (DNN) utilizes activation functions to compute output values. Training involves optimizing weights and biases to minimize loss. Traditional DNNs can't be analytically integrated, posing challenges with derivative data. Integrable Deep Neural Networks (IDNNs) address this by training differentiated functions to derivative data. The IDNN can be integrated analytically and its antiderivative is a standard DNN with the same weights and biases. By using the IDNN weights and biases, the analytically integrated DNN resembles a standard DNN."
"neural networks have the property of being uniform approximations of con- tinuous functions over compact domains . however, underlying symmetries of the domain are not guaranteed to be reproduced exactly by the dnn. for instance, consider a function, f, dened on variables x and y, such that they are symmetric under the inversion operation. given the symmetry of the domain of , the function is also symmetric under the same operation, i.e. f = f. any articial neural network that approximates f must reproduce this symmetry exactly. this can be enforced on the dnn by rst transforming the inputs to a set of symmetric functions . for example, within a neural network to approximate f, rather than use the values of as input, the symmetric functions can be used to parameterize the dnn. these functions map all symmetrically equivalent points in the space on to the same value, while also dierentiating symmetrically distinguishable points. as another example consider functions f that are invariant under an in- version about the y = line. a dnn that approximates any function in this class can be guaranteed to obey the required symmetry by using as the input functions. in general, a set of invariant inputs to the neural network may be dened by generating symmetry invariant polynomial functions with algorithms described by thomas and van der ven . we will denote these functions as h. since the given derivative data is likely dierentiated with respect to, for example, y and not y, we must incorporate the symmetrized inputs, h, into the loss function, e.g. mse  y h h x , y  , where y = y /x is the derivative data. bridging atomic to continuum scales via an idnn representation of the free energy density the phase eld model is an outgrowth of the allen-cahn theory that was originally developed to describe the motion of anti-phase boundaries in ordered compounds. many binary alloys form a disordered solid solution at elevated tem- perature that transforms to an ordered compound at low temperature. a well- known example is the order-disorder transition in brass, where an equiatomic alloy of cu and zn forms a disordered mixture over the sites of a body cen- tered cubic lattice at high temperature, but then orders into a cscl-type structure at low temperatures. the low temperature cuzn phase can be viewed as an ordered arrangement of cu and zn over the sites of the bcc lattice, as illustrated in figure this ordering on bcc is referred to as b because of the translation symmetry of the bcc lattice, there are two ways to form distinct b orderings on the same parent bcc lattice. the zn could, for example, occupy the corners of the conventional cubic bcc unit cell, while the cu occupies the body centered sites. alternatively, cu could occupy the corners, while zn occupies the body centered sites. the two orderings are identical, diering only by a rigid translation in space. an alloy that orders upon cooling may adopt the rst variant in some regions of the solid and the second variant in other regions. when the two variants impinge, they are separated by an anti-phase boundary. order parameters can be used to distinguish regions where the constituents of the alloy are ordered from regions where they are disordered. the order pa- rameters should also be able to distinguish between the dierent translational variants of the ordered phase. order parameters that satisfy these conditions for the b ordering on bcc are well known . they are dened as linear combinations of sublattice concentrations x and x that track the average con- centrations over the two sublattice sites and of the cubic unit cell shown in figure in a binary a-b alloy , each sublattice concentration xi is dened as the fraction of crystal sites belonging to sublattice site i that are occupied by b atoms. convenient order parameters to measure the degree of b long-range ordering can be dened as c = x + x = x x the rst order parameter, c, is a measure of the homogeneous composition of the alloy (i.e. proportional to the fraction of all crystal sites occupied by b atoms). the second order parameter, , measures the degree of long-range b- like ordering, and is equal to zero in the completely disordered state as the distinction between the two sublattices disappears in the absence of long-range order and x=x the order parameter is also able to distinguish between the two translational variants of b this becomes clear when considering an alloy containing an equal number of a and b components (i.e. when c = / ). in one translational variant of b, the b atoms occupy sublattice while the a atoms occupy sublattice for this variant x = and x = such that becomes equal to / in the second translational variant of b, the site occupancies are reversed and becomes equal to / the free energy, g, of a binary a-b alloy with a low-temperature preference for b ordering will be a function not only of temperature, t, and composition, x (= c/ ), but also the long-range order parameter . the dependence of g on t, x and can be calculated with statistical mechanics approaches. a binary alloy can be modeled as a lattice model that tracks the congurational degrees of freedom associated with all possible ways of arranging a and b atoms over m sites of a crystal. this is done by assigning an occupation variable i to each crystal site i = , , m, which is equal to + when site i is occupied by a b atoms and - when the site is occupied by an a atom. any arrangement of a and b atoms on the m-site crystal is then fully specied by the conguration vector = . the energy of the crystal for any congurations can be described with a cluster expansion hamiltonian e ( ) = vo + x i vii + x i,j vi,jij + x i,j,k vi,j,kijk + x kbt vnn figure : temperature-composition phase diagram calculated for the attractive nearest neigh- bor cluster expansion. second order phase transitions are estimated from the divergence of the heat capacity. the temperature is normalized based on the nearest neighbor pair interaction figure : schematic crystal structure of the b ordering of a and b atoms on the bcc crystal structure conventional cell of bcc showing two sublattices labeled and that are used to calculate sublattice compositions. where the expansion coecients vo, vi, vi,j, vi,j,k, are determined by the chemistry of the alloy and can be parameterized by training to a database of rst-principles electronic structure calculations. here, we use a simplied model cluster expansion hamiltonian that contains only the constant vo, a point term, vi and a term for the nearest neighbor cluster vi,j where i, j represents nearest neighbor clusters. the nearest neighbor pair interaction was chosen such that the b ordering is a ground state . the nite temperature thermodynamics associated with the order-disorder phase transition can be calculated with monte carlo simulations applied to the cluster expansion hamiltonian. figure shows the temperature versus composition phase diagram of the model alloy. the b stability domain is separated from the disordered solid-solution domain by a second order phase transition . conventional grand-canonical monte-carlo techniques restrict the calculated free energy to only the thermodynamically stable regions. however, since the unstable parts of the free energy are critical to describing the temporal and spatial evolution of the system within a phase eld model, we employed biased monte-carlo techniques to sample the free energy throughout the composition, order-parameter domain . the biased ensemble is dened with the following partition function: z = x exp  e( ) + mc(c( ) c) + m(( ) ) kbt  where e( ), c( ) and ( ) are the energy, homogeneous composition and long- range order parameter evaluated for conguration . the quantities c, , c and dene bias potentials, with curvatures given by c and , and centers at c and , respectively. the biased ensemble is sampled with metropolis monte-carlo, and statistical averages of the homogeneous composition c, and order parameter are measured for dierent values of , , and t. the statistical averages can be related to the derivatives of the free energy per atom as : c = g c = c = g = where c and are the chemical potentials with respect to the composition and order parameter respectively. the cluster expansions, and statistical mechanics calculations were performed with the casm code . the measured ensemble averages were then used to calculate free energy derivatives. . training free energy dnn an idnn representing the chemical potential data, c and , was trained to the derivative data, i.e. the chemical potential values, as described in section , such that the idnn could be analytically integrated to recover the free en- ergy. the idnn was implemented as a custom estimator using the tensorflow library , and was dened by two hidden layers with units per layer. the idnn was trained for epochs using the adagradoptimizer, with learning rates of and applied at dierent stages of training. a batch size of was used, with , points in the training set and , points used for cross-validation. the resulting learning curve is plotted in figure , showing the decrease of both the training and cross-validation mean square errors as training progressed. symmetry with respect to the order parameter about = was enforced. since the idnn has a more complex form than the standard dnn, it is reasonable to expect that it may require more training to achieve comparable errors. to demonstrate any dierences in training, ten idnns and ten standard epoch mean square error learning curves training validation figure : learning curve for the idnn showing the decrease in mean square error for test- ing and cross-validation datasets over training epochs. the cross-validation error is nearly indistinguishable from the training error. dnns were trained to the same chemical potential data, with the same sym- metry conditions imposed. all twenty neural networks consisted of two hidden layers of ten neurons, each with dierent initial values for the weights and bi- ases. they were trained for epochs with a learning rate of . the resulting learning curves appear in figure after epochs, the average mse for the standard dnns was higher than the average mse for the idnns. thus, the added complexity of the idnn does not inhibit the training. figure shows the original chemical potential data compared with the asso- ciated idnn that was trained to the corresponding chemical potential data. it also shows two views of the free energy surface as represented by the analytically integrated dnn. perhaps the most signicant feature of the free energy surface is the two energy wells, located at about c = / , = / given that the wells exist at the same composition, the material will not separate into multiple phases, but instead form anti-phase domains. this reects the expected physics of the system, described at the beginning of section . phase eld computation to demonstrate the use of the dnn representation of the free energy in computations, the analytically integrated free energy dnn was used in phase eld computations. the phase eld model was based on the coupled cahn- hilliard and allen-cahn equations , solved using isogeometric analysis . the simulation was performed using the mechanochemiga code, which is based on the petiga and petsc libraries, and run on the xsede comet hpc cluster . code available at github.com/mechanochem/mechanochemiga epoch mean

formulation given the homogeneous free energy density g as a function of concentra- tion, c, and order parameter, , we dene the total free energy as the following: = z  g + |c| + ||  dv the corresponding chemical potentials are given by the variational derivatives of the total free energy, namely c := /c and := /. using stan- dard variational methods results in the following equations for the chemical potentials: c = g c c = g the phase eld model consists of the cahn-hilliard and allen-cahn equa- tions, given by the following, respectively: c t = mc t = m the cahn-hilliard equation is in conservation form, with the ux dened as j := mc. it models the overall composition of the system through c, while conserving mass. the allen-cahn equation models the time evolution of the long-range ordering of the system through the non-conserved order parameter figure : top row: plots of the chemical potential idnn representations with the chemical potential data points . bottom row:

applied. a degenerate mobility of the following form was applied: m = mc( c) the weak form of the equations, as solved by the iga formulation, takes the following form: = z  wc t +  mw g,c + c  dv = z  w t + )  dv due to the stiness of the equations when using the realistic free energy density, a two-stage, fourth-order runge-kutta time stepping scheme was used . time step time step time step time step figure : the order parameter eld from the phase eld simulation is plotted, showing the formation of antiphase boundaries in a b alloy, with chemical potentials represented as idnns, integrated to yield the free energy. . phase eld results we considered a two-dimensional domain, discretized by a element mesh. the initial and boundary value problem was initialized with a uniform composition eld of c = / and an order parameter eld randomly perturbed about = by a value up to , representing a material that had just been quenched from a higher temperature. periodic boundary conditions were ap- plied. the initial time step was t = , with an adaptive time stepping scheme being applied to modify the time step based on the convergence of the nonlinear solver at each time step. as shown in figure , the initially disordered domain gradually forms regions of the two ordered states. the antiphase boundary has completely formed within time steps. the antiphase domains take on order parameter values of / , while the composition eld remains nearly uniform. as the simulation progresses, the microstructure coarsens with curvature uctuations from a straight antiphase boundary decreasing, as shown in figure time step time step time step figure : curvature uctuations away from straight antiphase boundaries decrease, and the domains coarsen with time. the chemical potentials are represented as idnns, integrated to yield the free energy. comparison with b-spline surface t for comparison with the idnns representation properties of complex sur- faces, we consider two-dimensional b-splines, motivated by their wide use in mathematics, and diverse applications in engineering . . formulation the equation for a b-spline surface y , with knots on a tensor grid can be written in the following form y = m x i= n x j= cijni,pmj,p where [ , m+p+ ], [ , n+p+ ], and ni,p is the b-spline basis function of order p. the basis functions are dened by the cox-de boor recursion formula ni,p = i i+p i ni,p + i+p+ i+p+ i+ ni+,p ni, = ( if i < i+ otherwise using the knot vector = { , , . . . , m+p+ }. mj,p is similarly dened using the knot vector = { , , . . . , n+p+ }. to convert the matrix c to a vector (to use the standard form for least squares tting), we use the following index conversion: i = ni+j, i = , . . . , m , j = , . . . , n , so that i = , . . . , mn then we can rewrite eq. as the following: y = mn x i= cipi,p where ci := cij and pi,p := ni,pmj,p. if evaluating multiple data points {( k, k)}, we can write the resulting vector of function evaluations using the following matrix-vector form, written in coordinate notation: yk = akici where aki = pi,p( k, k) we now consider tting to two sets of derivative data. for derivative datasets contained in the two vectors and , the following matrices are dened: bki = pi,p( k, k) cki = pi,p( k, k) then, we have the following least squares formulation, with some regularization added for numerical stability: c = arg min c h (bc )t (bc ) + (cc )t (cc ) + ct c i where is the regularization coecient. setting the gradient with respect to c equal to the zero vector leads to the following least squares solution: c =  bt b + ct c + i   bt + ct  where i is the identity matrix. equations and are applied, with datasets in the space corresponding to the space for b-spline sur- faces. chemical potential data for c and are contained in the vectors and , respectively. interior knots - - - - mse uniform knots training validation figure : the mean square error is compared for dierent numbers of knots distributed uniformly. . selection of knots while the method presented in the previous section can be used to optimize the values of the control points for given knot vectors, the locations of the knots also can be optimized to minimize the error. a variety of approaches are available, including nonlinear least squares, bisection, and genetic algorithms . our approach was performed in two steps. first, we divided the data into training data and validation data . as before, symmetry of the function about = was imposed. the optimal control points were found for a number of uniformly spaced knots, and the mean square error using the validation data was reported, as shown in figure higher numbers of knots were not used due to the resulting oscillatory behavior of the t, particularly in regions of missing data. knots placed at chebyshev nodes also resulted in inaccurate uctuations where data was missing when more than one interior knot was used. in comparing the resulting cross-validation error, it was found that thirteen uniformly distributed interior knots gave the lowest error with in the second step, we used matlabs genetic algorithm optimization routine to attempt to improve the b-spline t using thirteen interior knots per knot vector . appropriate inequality constraints were applied to maintain monotonically increasing knot vectors. the algorithm terminated after generations, with a mse of since this was not an improve- ment over the error with uniformly spaced knots, the b-spline t with thirteen uniformly spaced interior knots per knot vector was taken as the best t using b-splines. . b-spline results, and comparison with dnn the resulting b-spline representations of the chemical potentials and the free energy density are plotted in figure visually, these ts seem similar to those of the dnn in figure , although there are notable dierences. figure : top row: plots of the chemical potential b-spline surfaces with data in grey. bottom row: free energy density b-spline surface. the behavior of the dynamics related to antiphase domains is dictated pri- marily by the sign of g/. these values are plotted in figure , along with data points within c = / for comparison. antiphase segregation occurs in a domain where the sign of g/ changes from positive to negative for increasing . in order for antiphase domains to occur in the phase eld simulations, the initial conditions, which as in section . consist of random perturbations about = in the range , must lie on both sides of the point where the sign of g/ changes from positive to negative. while this condition holds true for the dnn representation, it does not hold for the b- spline representation. due to oscillations in the b-spline representation, g/ changes from negative to positive, rather than positive to negative, within the range of initial order parameter values. this results in a phase eld solution that does not produce antiphase regions, but instead reaches an equilibrium with uniform values of = and c = / it is possible, however, that other methods for knot selection or additional constraints might produce a better t with b-splines. the b-spline representation is more computationally ecient than the dnn. - - - order parameter, - - g/ g/ at c=/ b-spline idnn data figure : comparison of g/ at c = / for the idnn and b-spline ts, showing the regions where the sign of g/ goes from positive to negative and antiphase separation occurs. the g/ data are also plotted as points. the phase eld code evaluates the free energy and all rst and second derivatives at each quadrature point. using the de boor algorithm for b-spline evaluation , the flop count for each function evaluation is about the highest order term in the count is p, with polynomial order p. signicantly, the flop count for the b-spline evaluation does not depend on the size of the knot vector. the dnn representation, on the other hand, requires about flops per evaluation of the dnn and its derivatives, using a naive implementation. the highest order term of the count is mn, where m is the neurons per layer and n is the number of layers. however, an improved evaluation algorithm could potentially reduce the flop count. the use of accelerators could also speed up the function evaluations, without reducing the total flop count. while the flop count for the free energy evaluation of the dnn is more than times that of the b-spline, this aects only the computation time for the assembly of the residual vector and tangent matrix. the wall time for the matrix-vector solution will be equivalent for the two methods, assuming both tted functions are similar enough to give comparable condition numbers. for the dnn and b-spline ts presented here, the average computation time per time step over the rst time steps using b-splines was s, while it was s using the dnn. the total computation time using the dnn was, then, only about times that of the computation using the b-spline to represent the free energy. for larger problems, the matrix size increases and solver time comes to dominate the average computation time. in this limit the wall times will converge.","Neural networks may not perfectly reproduce symmetries of a domain, requiring enforcement for accurate approximations. Symmetric functions can be used to parameterize neural networks to ensure exact symmetry reproduction. A phase field model based on Allen-Cahn theory describes order-disorder transitions in alloys. Two ordering variants are distinguished by order parameters. To bridge atomic to continuum scales, an interpretable deep neural network (iDNN) was trained to represent free energy density, integrated for phase field simulations. Results demonstrated the ability to model antiphase boundaries. Comparison with B-spline surfaces showed differences in behavior, with the iDNN representation supporting antiphase segregation. The iDNN computation time was slightly higher than B-spline, but both methods showed comparable results in representing the free energy."

"this communication adds to our nascent, but growing body of work in ma- chine learning and articial intelligence targeting higher delity models of ma- terials physics . we have explored machine learning as an approach to bridging scales, by focusing on the representation of complexity emerging from ne scale physics. here, the ne scales come from atomic and statistical me- chanics descriptions, which can parameterize thermodynamic functions, such as free energy densities with high delity. at the core of this work is the idea of an analytically integrable deep neural network to represent such functions. the idnn is of particular use in the context of mathematically rep- resenting the free energy density of a material, where only the derivative data is originally known and the trained function must be integrated to recover the free energy. it is highly relevant to multidimensional systems, where multiple sets of partial derivative data must be trained against simultaneously under the constraint that all trained functions are the partial derivatives of one common function. using as a prototypical case a binary alloy, an idnn was trained to two sets of chemical potential data, which were found using rst principles calcula- tions. since these datasets are derivatives of the same free energy density, the analytic integrability of the idnn, which exactly preserves consistency of repre- sentation, assumes importance. symmetry with respect to the order parameter was embedded in the idnn. we anticipate an expansion of these approaches to embedding fundamental aspects of the physics into machine learning models as this eld develops. phase eld simulations with the analytically integrated dnn representing the free energy recovered the proper physics of the system, showing the creation and subsequent coarsening of antiphase domains in the material. this example demonstrates the ability of the idnn to capture the relevant physics of a ma- terial system. interestingly, the idnn was able to represent the physics of the system more faithfully than a b-spline representation, even in the current, rela- tively simple case, of a two-dimensional input. we note that in earlier work, we have demonstrated that b-spline representations themselves are superior to the more traditional redlich-kister polynomials at resolving rapidly varying ther- modynamic functions . the present work is a continuation of that thread, and establishes that, even for only two-dimensional functions, the b-spline ap- proach also may be inadequate. it is natural to expect that high-dimensional chemical potentials and free energy densities will present greater challenges. future work will consider systems of greater complexity, where the free en- ergy density has such higher-dimensional dependence on variables that number o. in this regime, high delity representations of the free energy den- sity will be crucial to reproducing the physics through scale bridging, and the uniform approximation property of dnns, inherited by the idnns, will deliver greater advantages.","This section highlights the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in creating high-fidelity models of materials physics, focusing on bridging scales and representing complexity emerging from fine-scale physics. An analytically integrable deep neural network is introduced to mathematically represent the free energy density of materials, particularly in multidimensional systems. The neural network was trained on chemical potential data of a binary alloy to accurately capture the physics of the system. The approach outperformed traditional methods like b-spline representations in capturing rapidly varying thermodynamic functions. The study suggests that as the field evolves, embedding fundamental physics into machine learning models will become increasingly important for accurately modeling material systems with higher-dimensional complexities."

"arxiv:v sep stability of characters and filters for weighted semilattices yemon choi, mahya ghandehari, hung le pham september st abstract we continue the study of the amnm property for weighted semilattices that was initiated in . we reformulate this in terms of stability of lters with respect to a given weight function, and then provide a combinatorial condition which is necessary and sucient for this lter stability property to hold. examples are given to show that this new condition allows for easier and unied proofs of some results in , and furthermore allows us to verify the amnm property in situations not covered by the results of that paper. as a nal application, we show that for a large class of semilattices, arising naturally as union-closed set systems, one can always construct weights for which the amnm property fails. keywords: amnm, breadth, hyersulam stability, semilattice, stable characters, sta- ble lters msc : primary a secondary a","The text discusses the stability of characters and filters for weighted semilattices. It explores the AMNM property for weighted semilattices and formulates it in terms of stability of filters with a given weight function. A combinatorial condition is provided as necessary and sufficient for filter stability. Examples show that this condition aids in easier proofs and verifying the AMNM property in situations not covered previously. Additionally, it demonstrates that for a class of semilattices, weights can be constructed where the AMNM property fails. Key concepts include AMNM, breadth, Hyers-Ulam stability, semilattice, stable characters, stable filters."
"background context this paper is a sequel to , in which the rst author studied approximately multi- plicative functionals on weighted convolution algebras of semilattices, and the problem of whether all such functionals arise as small-norm perturbations of multiplicative ones. banach algebras with such a stability property are said to be amnm or f-stable . when s is a semigroup and is a weight on s, the amnm condition on the banach algebra is equivalent to a kind of hyersulam- type stability for c-valued functions on s, where the stability is measured in terms of the weight . hence, one can dene the notion of amnm for the pair directly without relying on the banach-algebraic concept . indeed, the present paper has been written so that no banach algebra theory is required. in the case where s is a semilattice, a sucient condition for to be amnm was given in , which covered many natural examples, such as semilattices with nite breadth. however, it was pointed out by the third author in an unpublished communication, that this condition fails to hold for some straightforward examples, such as example below, and so it was clear that the earlier paper left signicant room for improvement. for example, is the weighted semilattice in example amnm?","The paper is a sequel that explores the stability of Banach algebras with multiplicative functionals on weighted convolution algebras of semilattices. The authors investigate whether all such functionals can be seen as small-norm perturbations of multiplicative ones, leading to the concept of amnm or f-stability. The study shows that the amnm condition can be related to a Hyers-Ulam-type stability for c-valued functions on a semigroup, measured by a weight. The research aims to define amnm directly for the pair without relying on Banach algebra theory. While previous work provided sufficient conditions for amnm in semilattices with finite breadth, it was noted that these conditions may not hold for certain examples, highlighting the need for further improvement in the study."
"in this paper we sharpen some of the techniques introduced in , and put them in a more systematic framework, to obtain a necessary and sucient criterion for a weighted semilattice to be amnm. as an intermediate step, we observe that it suces to restrict attention to functions on s with values in {, }, rather than those with codomain c. this was already noted in but we take the opportunity to give some extra details and make some minor corrections. these and other preliminary results are given in section , which also has a brief discussion of characters on semilattices and the corresponding lters. the discretization procedure mentioned above allows us to change perspective from character stability to lter stability . our cri- terion is then an intrinsic characterization of the lter stability property, in terms of a combinatorial property of the pair that we call propagation. the precise statement is given in theorem , and most of section is devoted to setting up the necessary framework. we highlight two easy applications of theorem : it is easy to check that the weighted semilattice described in example has prop- agation at all levels. therefore, by theorem , this weighted semilattice satises lter stability, and hence is amnm. details are given in section , which also explains why the results of are insucient here. it is also easy to check that if s is a semilattice with nite breadth, then for any choice of weight we have propagation at all levels. hence we can apply theorem once again, to deduce that is amnm. this was already observed in , but theorem provides a unied framework to see why this result holds. a third application, which requires substantially more work, forms the nal main result of our paper ; it addresses a question raised in the closing remarks of . given the result stated above in , and given that there is a weighted semilattice which is not amnm , it is natural to ask if every s with innite breadth can be equipped with some weight such that is not amnm. while we are unable to resolve this question here, we use the propagation criterion to obtain a positive answer for a large class of semilattices: namely, those which embed homomorphically into , ) for some set .","The paper refines existing techniques to establish a necessary criterion for a weighted semilattice to be amnm. By focusing on functions with values in {, } rather than on a full codomain c, the study introduces a systematic framework and identifies a combinatorial property called propagation as intrinsic to filter stability. The main results include easy applications to weighted semilattices and a generalized positive answer for a large class of semilattices embedding homomorphically. These findings are presented alongside thorough discussions and framework setups, providing clarity on filter stability properties in a technical perspective."
"we would like to extend the construction used to prove theorem to cover all semilat- tices, not just those s that embed into , ). this runs into some serious technical obstacles. most notably, our construction relies on being able to locate nite free sub- semilattices of s that t togther in a well-behaved way; this is possible here because nite free subsemilattices of , ) only live on a nite part of , and hence can be inductively removed without interfering too much with the embedded copy of s. to move from pn to the full powerset p, it seems that a deeper study is required of union-closed set systems with innite breadth, and their possible substructures. we intend to pursue this in greater depth in forthcoming work.","The construction used to prove a theorem is being extended to cover all semilattices, not just those that embed into a specific structure. However, this extension faces technical obstacles due to the need to locate finite free sub-semilattices that fit together in a manner that allows for a well-behaved construction. The current method relies on the sub-semilattices being finite and living on a finite part of a structure, allowing for them to be inductively removed without disrupting the embedded copy of the original semilattice. To extend the construction to the full powerset, further investigation into union-closed set systems with infinite breadth and their substructures is necessary. Future work will focus on exploring these aspects more deeply to overcome these challenges."
"notational conventions if a and b are non-empty sets then ab denotes the set of functions b a; p denotes the powerset of b; and pn denotes the set of all nite subsets of b. some of our later examples are subsets of pn for some non-empty set . when working with those examples, we shall use upper-case calligraphic letters to denote subsets of pn, while using letters such as a or e for subsets of ; elements of will be denoted by lower-case greek letters. if s and t are semigroups then the set of homomorphisms from s to t is denoted by hom. the zero function on a given set will usually be denoted by , the domain being clear from context. semilattices, characters and lters we recall some standard denitions, for readers who are not semigroup theorists. a semilattice is a commutative semigroup s satisfying x = x for all x s. such an s has a standard and canonical partial order: if x, y s we write x y whenever xy = x. it is sometimes useful to read x y as: x is a multiple of y or y is a factor of x. in this language, xy is the largest common multiple of x and y. with respect to , xy is the meet of x and y; this gives an alternative, order-theoretic denition of a semilattice, as a poset in which every pair of elements has a meet. both the semigroup denition and the order-theoretic denition t well with the intuition from the next example. example . the set {, }, equipped with usual multipli- cation, is a semilattice, which we shall denote by (note that the partial order dened above satises ) if x is a non-empty index set then x, equipped with co-ordinatewise multiplication, is also a semilattice. each x can be identied with x, and this denes an isomorphism of semilattices x = , ). semilattices of the form , ) are universal in a certain sense. given a semi- lattice s, for each x s let ex = {t s : t x}. the denition of implies that ex ey = exy for all x, y s, and so the function sch : s , ) dened by x ex is a semigroup homomorphism. since x ex for all x s, it is also easily veried that sch is injective. thus every semilattice can be represented faithfully as a set system which is closed under binary intersections or, by taking complements, as a set system which is closed under binary unions. the map sch has appeared in the literature under various names, such as the cayley embedding or the sch utzenberger representation . we now turn to characters. let s be a commutative semigroup, and regard c as a semi- group with respect to multiplication. following the terminology of , a semicharacter on s is a semigroup homomorphism s c which is bounded (equivalently, which takes values in the closed unit disc) and which is not identically zero. the set of semicharacters on s is denoted by b s. if s is a semilattice, every semigroup homomorphism s c takes values in {, }, so using the notation of example we have b s {} = hom s . it turns out that b s is a sub-semilattice of s. this is reminiscent of the situation for abelian groups: non-zero semigroup homomorphisms from an abelian group g to c take values in t, and it turns out that the set of characters b g is a subgroup of tg. remark . in lattice theory it is more common to call a non-zero homomorphism s a character of the semilattice s. we will adopt this convention, which ts ; the remarks above show that the concepts of semicharacter and character coincide for semilattices. we shall reserve semicharacter for general commutative semigroups. remark . there is a duality theory for semilattices in which acts as the dualizing object, analogous to pontrjagin duality for abelian groups where t is the dualizing object. see for further details, with an emphasis on category-theoretic aspects; an accessible pr ecis, without proofs, is provided in . here, we merely remark that there is a natural embedding g : s b s which sends x s to b x : ; this is essentially the same as the gelfand representation for the commutative banach algebra as noted above, {, }-valued functions on s correspond to subsets of s. it is standard knowledge in semilattice theory that, under this correspondence, characters on s (viewed as elements of hom) correspond to lters in s. this perspective was already exploited in , and will be pursued more systematically in this paper. we therefore review some of the details for the readers convenience. traditionally, a lter in a semilattice s is dened to be a non-empty subset f which is a subsemigroup (so x, y f = xy f) and is upwards-closed with respect to (so x s, y f and xy = y = x f). the second condition is equivalent to xy f = x, y f we leave the proof to the reader and so for this paper we adopt the following equivalent denition, which makes the link with characters clearer. definition . let s be a semilattice and let f s. we say that f is a lter in s if it is non-empty and satises x, y s (xy f x, y f). the set of all lters in s will be denoted by filt. it follows that for each x s, x is a lter in s if and only if x b s; equivalently, b s = { s : is a lter in s}. we can use duality theory and the link with lters to give an explanation of the cayley embedding/sch utzenberger representation that was mentioned earlier. each y s denes a lter fy = {t s : t y}, and so y fy denes an injective function f : s b s. by restriction, we obtain a homomorphism of semilattices f : b s s. then, composing f with the homomorphism g : s b s from remark yields f g : s s , ). checking through the denitions, we nd that for each x s f g = {y s : b x = } = {y s : x fy} = {y s : y x}. thus f g is exactly the embedding sch : s , ) from before.","The section on background and preliminaries introduces notational conventions for sets and functions, defines semilattices as commutative semigroups satisfying certain properties, and discusses characters and filters in semilattices. It explains the concept of semicharacters, which are semigroup homomorphisms that are bounded and not identically zero, and relates them to characters. The text also mentions a duality theory for semilattices, similar to Pontrjagin duality for abelian groups, and discusses the relationship between characters and filters in semilattice theory. It concludes by detailing the Cayley embedding or Schützenberger representation, linking characters with filters through a homomorphism of semilattices."
"in this section, we set up the notion of amnm for weighted semilattices in a way that does not require denitions or results from the theory of banach algebras. we also take the opportunity to make precise some arguments from that were unclear or incomplete as stated there: see lemma and proposition below. we start in a more general setting. let s be a semigroup. a weight function on s is a function : s which is submultiplicative; that is, for all x, y s. we shall often refer to the pair as a weighted semigroup. given a weighted semigroup and , cs, we dene: def = sup{| | : x, y s} d = sup xs | | dist = inf{d: hom} where in the last denition we view c as a multiplicative semigroup. note that in all three denitions we allow the value +. def and dist give two dierent ways to quantify the failure of to be a homomorphism;

thus e wl = e wl. suppose e wl = e wl. then e = e whenever el. hence |e e| min) for all x, which implies d el. if e s, let l denote the lter-or-empty-set generated by e, i.e. the intersection of all x s such that x filt {} and x e. note that l = if and only if e = . remark . let e s and let l suppose there is some f filt {} such that e wl = f wl. since f contains e wl it contains l. hence e wl = f wl l wl e wl which forces e wl = l wl. summarizing: if e agrees with some lter-or-empty-set at level l, it agrees with the particular lter-or-empty-set l at level l. hence, in view of lemma , dist is small if and only if e agrees with l at level l for some large l. characterizing sets with small -defect let x s be non-empty. note that if x, y x and z xy then z l. moreover, every z l satises z x xk for some x, . . . , xk x. definition . let c for x s we dene fbpc := {z wc : there exist x, y x wc such that z xy} . note that fbpc = . we always have fbpc x wc; if equality holds, we say that x is fbpc-stable. x is fbpc-stable if and only if fbpc x: the only if direction is trivial, and the if direction holds because fbpc wc for any x s. lemma . let be a weighted semilattice, and put = log . let x s. let c if x is fbpc-stable, then def ec. let > if def < then x is fbpc-stable for any c log. proof. assume x is fbpc-stable, and let x, y s. we consider two cases. case a: + c. in this case ece+ = ec, and so |x xx| ec. case b: + c. in this case x, y and xy all belong to wc. since x is fbpc-stable: if x and y are in x, then xy fbpc fbpc x; if xy lies in x, then both x and y belong to fbpc fbpc x. thus in this case, x = xx. putting case a and case b together, we see that def ec. if x wc = then we are done. so suppose x wc = . let x, y x wc, and let z wc with z xy. then |x xx| def defec, |x xx| def defec, and both are strictly less than if def < and c log. since x = = x, the rst formula in implies x = ; feeding this into the second formula yields z x. therefore fbpc x wc, and the converse inclusion is trivial. summarizing: a subset of s has small -defect precisely when it is fbpc-stable for some large value of c. fbpc-stability and propagation an obvious way to obtain fbpc-stable sets is by iteration. given e s, put fbp c = e wc and for k recursively dene fbpk c = fbpc(fbpk c ). then e wc fbpc fbp c fbp c . . . dene fbp c to be the inductive limit s k fbpc. by induction, e wc fbp c l wc for all e s. even when s is nite, the second inclusion in can be proper, as we will see in example . on the other hand, if e is non-empty and z l, there always exists some c , possibly depending on z, such that z fbp c . (for instance, if x, . . . , xk e and z x xk then c = max{pk i= , } suces.) this leads naturally to the following denition. definition . for z l, let ve = inf {c : z fbp c } . given l , we say that propagates at level l, or has l-propagation, if sup =ewl sup zlwl ve < . it is convenient to set ve := +whenever z / l. we make some observations for future reference: for every z s we have ve and ve infxe . (the rst inequality holds since fbp c wc. the second one holds because if c < infxe then fbpc = , preventing z fbp c .) if propagates at a level l, then it also does so at every lower level. in the formula dening l-propagation, we could restrict e to the nite subsets of wl without altering the value of the double supremum. we can now state and prove the promised characterization of lter stability. theorem . let be a weighted semilattice and let = log . the following conditions are equivalent. is amnm. > > such that every g s with def < satises dist < . l c such that every g s which is fbpc-stable satises g wl = l wl. has l-propagation for all l proof. the equivalence of and was proved in proposition . the equivalence of and has been demonstrated in the previous two subsections: specically, one combines lemma , remark and lemma with some standard epsilon-delta book-keeping. suppose that condition holds. let l then we may choose c l such that vg c for all g wl and all z l wl. let e s be fbpc-stable and put g = e wl. by our choice of c and the denition of vg, l wl fbp c . but since e is fbpc-stable the right-hand side is contained in e. hence lwl e wl, and the converse inclusion is trivial. thus condition holds. conversely, suppose condition holds. let l be arbitrary, and choose c with the property stated in . let e wl. put k = max. since c k, it follows from the denitions that every fbpk-stable set is fbpc-stable. in particular, fbp k is fbpc-stable, so by the property stated in , fbp k wl = l(fbp k wl) wl. but since k l and e wl, the right-hand side contains l wl. hence l wl fbp k . this shows that the double supremum in is k, hence nite; so has l-propagation, and holds. an example where our theorem improves on earlier results in the language of the present paper, may be restated as follows. let be a weighted semilattice, with = log , such that for each l , is bounded on the subsemilattice generated by wl. then is amnm. consider the semilattice s and log-weight from example . that is, s = , ) for some nonempty set , and = |x| for x s. since {} w for each , the subsemilattice generated by w is {x s : x = }. hence the condition in fails for l = , and cannot be applied. on the other hand, we will now show that has l-propagation for all l putting = exp , it follows from theorem that is amnm. our task will be made slightly simpler using two preliminary observations: we only need to verify l-propagation for all l n; we only need to check the supremum in for nite subsets of wl. let l n, and let e be a non-empty nite subset of wl. put a = s xe x, which is nite and non-empty. a straightforward argument shows that l = p, so that l wl = {z a: |z| l} . if z a then there exist x, . . . , xk e such that z x . . . xk; moreover, if |z| l then we can always choose k l. therefore, ve l for all z lwl. since this upper bound holds for all nite non-empty e wl, propagates at level l, just as we claimed.","The section discusses the notion of amnm for weighted semilattices without relying on definitions or results from the theory of Banach algebras. It introduces concepts such as weight functions, -boundedness, -defect, and the amnm property. The text also covers the equivalence between the weighted convolution algebra and the Banach-algebraic amnm property. Specializing to semilattices, the section provides lemmas and propositions to characterize stability of filters and sets with small -defect. It concludes with a theorem that offers an intrinsic, combinatorial characterization of filter stability based on log-weights and propagation. The presented results improve upon earlier findings by providing a comprehensive understanding of stability properties in the context of weighted semilattices."

"the following is a small variation on the previous example. example . let be a non-empty set, and let pn denote the set of nite non-empty subsets of . equipped with binary union, pn is a semilattice, which we refer to as the free semilattice generated by . this terminology is justied by the following universal property: for any semilattice s and any function f : s, there is a unique homomorphism e f : (pn , ) s that extends f, dened by e f = q a f. when is a nite, non-empty set, we write p instead of pn . semilattices of the form , ) were used in as the building blocks for a weighted semilattice that does not have the amnm property. the new notion of propagation gives a very natural viewpoint on this construction, with the key details demonstrated in the following example. example . let be a nite set with at least two elements. dene := |z| if z , := ). then is a log-weight on the semilattice , ). let e = {{}: }, and note that w = e {}. in particular l w on the other hand, ve ||. to see this, let c be such that fbp c . we have / e wc = fbp c; let m n be minimal such that fbpm c . then there exist a, a fbpm c such that a a by minimality of m, both a and a are proper subsets of , and so || |a| + |a| = + c. hence ve ||, as claimed. intuitively, for this log-weight, the constraint in the fbpc operation that we can only multiply elements of log-weight c creates a barrier separating us from , even though itself has small log-weight. the previous example suggests that to construct log-weights on a given s for which propagation fails, we should look for isomorphic copies of , ) inside s. if e s is a nite subset, with e : e s being the inclusion map, consider f e : p s, in the notation of example . f e maps p onto e, the subsemigroup of s geneated by e; it is injective if and only if ehas maximal cardinality |p| = |e| definition . let s be a semilattice. given a nite, non-empty subset e s, we say e is compressible if there exists a proper subset e e such that q xe x = q xe x; otherwise, we say e is incompressible. it is a straightforward exercise to show that e is incompressible if and only if e e : p s is injective of ). remark . our terminology is not entirely stan- dard; the same property is referred to in as meet irredundant. however, for examples which arise as subsemilattices of , ), as in the next section, the canon- ical partial order is not given by inclusion but by containment: a b a b; and the meet of a and b with respect to is not a b, but rather a b. in other words, for natural examples we want to consider, the product operation is naturally viewed as a join rather than a meet, and the terminology incompressible seems more appropriate. definition . the breadth of a semilattice s is dened to be br = sup {n n : every subset e s with n + elements is compressible} = sup {|e|: e is a nite incompressible subset of s} . the breadth of a semilattice sheds some light on its structure, and is related to more fa- miliar order-theoretic concepts such as height and width. for instance, suppose br n. by examining incompressible subsets, one sees that s contains a chain (totally ordered subset) and an antichain both of cardi- nality n; see for further details and some references. in particular, a semilattice s has breadth exactly when the poset is totally ordered. diverse behaviour occurs even among semilattices of breadth for instance, the following example shows that every innite k-ary rooted tree is a semilattice with breadth that contains innite chains and innite antichains. example . let k an innite k-ary rooted tree is an innite rooted tree in which every vertex has k children. if x and y are vertices in the tree then they have a youngest common ancestor, which we denote by x y. clearly is a commutative, associative and idempotent binary operation; so the set of vertices becomes a semilattice , and the partial order becomes is an ancestor of. there is an innite path p t obtained by starting at the root and successively taking one of the children; this gives us an innite chain in . if for each element of p we then take one of its children that is not in p, then the collection obtained is an innite antichain in . let x, y, z t, and let p = x y z. then either x y or y z is equal to p: for if not, the set {p, x y, y z, y} would form a cycle of length in the tree t, which is impossible. thus every -element subset of s is compressible, and so br on the other hand, br , since s is not totally ordered. remark . suppose s is a semilattice with nite breadth. it was originally shown in that in this case, is amnm for every weight function . with the tools of the previous section, we can give an alternative approach to this result. let n = br, and let e be a nite subset of s. as observed in the remarks before denition : if x, . . . , xk e and z is a factor of x xk, then for any c max{pk i= , } we have z fbp c . but since br = n, every z l is a factor of x xk for some x, . . . , xk e with k n. it follows that whenever e wl, ve nl for all z l wl, and therefore propagates at level l for any l and any log-weight . now we can apply theorem . motivated by this result, it is natural to ask the following question, which was raised implicitly in . question. let s be a semilattice with innite breadth. does there exist a log-weight on s for which propagation fails at some level? at present, we do not have an answer in full generality. however, when s is (isomorphic to) a sub-semilattice of , ), the answer is positive. this is the nal main result of our paper. theorem . let be a non-empty set, and let s pn be closed under binary union. if has innite breadth, then there is a log-weight on s which fails -propagation. the proof of theorem takes up the rest of this section. from here onwards, let s be a subsemilattice of , ) which has innite breadth. if e is a nite subset of s, we write join for s ae a s. lemma . let a pn and let n then there exist b, . . . , bn s and , . . . , n \ a, such that j bj \ bk whenever j = k. proof. let m = |a| < . since s has innite breadth it has an incompressible subset of size m + n, which we may enumerate as b, . . . , bm+n. then for each j, incompressibility implies bj s k : k=j bk, so t k : k=j bj \ bk is non-empty and we may pick some j in this set. note that , . . . , m+n are all distinct. since at most m of these belong to a, at least n of them belong to \ a; reordering if necessary, we may take these to be , . . . , n. proposition . there is a sequence n= in pn, and a sequence n= in p, with the following properties: for each n, |en| = |fn| = n; the sets e, e, . . . are pairwise disjoint; each x fn satises x ej for all j n ; for each n and each en, there is a unique x fn such that x. proof. we construct both sequences together by induction on n. for the base case of n = : pick any non-empty a s, pick any a, and lete = {}, f = {a}. now let n and suppose we have found e, . . . , en and f, . . . , fn with the desired properties. in particular, since each point of ei belongs to some x fi, we have ei join for i = , . . . , n let a := join. . .join;

"in the most dicult part of our proof, the arc-transitive graph of valency twice a prime will have a normal quotient with prime valency. we will thus need a lot of information about arc-transitive graphs of prime valency, which we collect in this section. we start with the following result, which is : theorem . let be a connected g-arc-transitive graph of prime valency p such that the action of g on v is either quasiprimitive or biquasiprimitive. then one of the following holds: g contains a semiregular element of odd prime order; |v| is a power of ; = k, g = m and p = ; |v| = /s and g = psl or pgl, where p is a mersenne prime and cr cs < c/ , where r is the product of the distinct prime divisors of /; |v| = /s and g = pgl, where p and s are as in part , and g is the standard double cover of the graph given in . we note that in cases and , we must have p , since this is the smallest mersenne prime p such that / is not squarefree. this fact will be used at the end of section corollary . let be a connected g-arc-transitive graph of prime valency. then one of the following holds: g contains a semiregular element of odd prime order; |v| is a power of ; g contains a normal -subgroup p such that is one of the graph-group pairs in of theorem . proof. suppose that |v| is not a power of and let p be a normal subgroup of g that is maximal subject to having at least three orbits on v. in particular, p is the kernel of the action of g on the set of p-orbits. hence g/p acts faithfully, and quasiprimitively or biquasiprimitively on v. since has prime valency and g-arc-transitive, implies that p is semiregular. we may thus assume that p is a -group. (otherwise p contains a semiregular element of odd prime order.) if g/p contains a semiregular element of odd prime order, then lemma implies that so does g. we may assume that this is not the case. similarly, we may assume that |v| is not a power of | is a power of ) it follows that /p and g/p are as is of theorem . we will now prove some more results about the graphs that appear in of theorem . let us rst recall the notion of coset graphs. let g be a group with a subgroup h and let g g such that g h but g / ng. the graph cos has vertices the right cosets of h in g, with two cosets hx and hy adjacent if and only if xy hgh. observe that the action of g on the set of vertices by right multiplication induces an arc-transitive group of automorphisms such that h is the stabiliser of a vertex. moreover, every arc-transitive graph can be constructed in this way . lemma . the graphs in and of theorem have a triangle. proof. clearly k has a triangle so suppose that is one of the graphs given in . since g is quasiprimitive on v and has prime valency, it follows that psl is arc-transitive on and so = cos where g = psl, h = cp cs and g g g such that hgh is a union of p distinct right cosets of h. let x ng = cp c/ note that g acts -transitively on the set of right cosets of ng with the stabiliser of any two points being isomorphic to c/ now the coset hx v is xed by h and in particular h has |ng : h| = /)/ps = /s xed points on v. if y / ng, then the orbit of hy under h has length |h : h hy| and since |ng : arc-transitive graphs of valency twice a prime ngy)| = p, it follows that |h : h hy| = p. thus the points of v that are not xed by h are permuted by h in orbits of size p and so for any g / ng we have that hgh is a union of p distinct right cosets of h. for each x ng dene the bijection x of v by hy xhy = hxy. since g acts on v by right multiplication, we see that x commutes with each element of g. moreover, x is nontrivial if and only if x / h. let c = {x | x ng} sym). since g acts transitively on v and c centralises g, it follows from that c acts semiregularly on v. now |c| = |ng : h| = /s and g c sym). since c g c, the set of orbits of c forms a system of imprimitivity for g c and hence for g. moreover, since c is semiregular, comparing orders yields that c has |v|/|c| = p + orbits. one of these orbits is the set of xed points of h and h transitively permutes the remaining p orbits of c. in particular, it follows that c transitively permutes the nontrivial orbits of h and so the isomorphism type of does not depend on the choice of the double coset hgh. let z be the subgroup of scalar matrices in sl and let h be the subgroup of the stabiliser in sl of the -dimensional subspace such that h = h/z. note that h =   h and let g =   . in particular, letting h = hz and g = gz we have that g / ng and so we may assume that = cos. now hg and hgh are both adjacent to h and one can check that g = hgh hgh and so {h, hg, hgh} is a triangle in . denition . let be a graph and let s be a subset of v. let s = s if a vertex u outside s has at least two neighbours in s, add u to s. repeat this procedure until no more vertex outside s have this property. if at the end of the procedure, we have s = v, then we say that is dense with respect to s corollary . let be a graph in or of theorem and let s = {u, v} be an edge of . then is dense with respect to s proof. since is arc-transitive of prime valency p, the local graph at v (that is, the subgraph induced on ) is a vertex-transitive graph of order p and thus vertex-primitive. by lemma , has a triangle so the local graph has at least one edge and thus must be connected. it follows that, running the process described in denition starting at s = s, eventually s will contain all neighbours of v. repeating this argument and using connectedness of yields the desired conclusion. the following is immediate from denition . lemma . let be a graph and s be a set of vertices such that is dense with respect to s then the standard double cover of , with vertex-set v{, }, is dense with respect to s {, }.","The section discusses arc-transitive graphs of prime valency, focusing on the challenging proof involving a graph with valency twice a prime having a normal quotient with prime valency.

"let p be a prime, let be an arc-transitive graph of valency p and let g = aut. we may assume that is connected. if g is quasiprimitive or bi-quasiprimitive, then g contains a nontrivial semiregular element, by and . we may thus assume that g has a minimal normal subgroup n such that n has at least three orbits. in particular, /n has valency at least if n is nonabelian, then g has a nontrivial semiregular element by . we may therefore assume that n is abelian and, in particular, n is an elementary abelian q-group for some prime q. we may also assume that n is not semiregular that is, nv = for some vertex v. it follows from lemma that = n v g v . as is g-arc-transitive, we have that g v is transitive and so the orbits of n v all have the same size, either or p. since n is a q-group, this size is equal to q. writing d for the valency of /n, we have that either = or = . m. giudici and g. verret if d = and q = p, then it follows from that is isomorphic to a graph de- noted by c in . by , aut) contains the nontrivial semiregular automorphism dened in . we may thus assume that d = p and q = in this case, if u is adjacent to v, then u has exactly = p/d neighbours in vn. let k be the kernel of the action of g on n-orbits. by the previous observation, the orbits of k v have size and thus it is a -group. it follows from lemma that kv is a -group and thus so is k = nkv. now, g/k is an arc-transitive group of automorphisms of /n, so we may apply corollary . if g/k has a semiregular element of odd prime order, then so does g, by lemma . if |v| is a power of , then so is |v| and, in this case, g contains a semiregular involution by lemma . we may thus assume that we are in case of corollary , that is, g/k contains a normal -subgroup p/k such that is one of the graph-group pairs in of theorem . note that p is a -group. let m be a minimal normal subgroup of g contained in the centre of p. we may assume that m is not semiregular hence mv = and so by lemma , m v = moreover, |m| = as otherwise mv = m and we would deduce that m xes each element of v, a contradicition. since m is central in p, mv xes every vertex in vp . note that the g-conjugates of mv must cover m, otherwise m contains a nontrivial semiregular element. by the previous paragraph, the number of conjugates of mv is bounded above by the number of p-orbits, that is |v|, so we have |m| |mv||v|. since is connected and g-arc-transitive, there are no edges within p-orbits. as m v = , there exists g mv such that w and wg are distinct neighbours of v. let u be the other neighbour of w in vp . since mv xes every element of vp it follows that u is also a neighbour of w and wg and so {v, w, u, wg} is a -cycle in . thus the graph induced between adjacent p-orbits is a union of cs. if x is a vertex and yp is a p-orbit adjacent to x, then there is a unique c containing x between xp and yp , and thus a unique vertex z antipodal to x in this c we say that z is the buddy of x with respect to yp . the set of buddies of v is equal to vp , which is clearly xed setwise by gv. moreover, each vertex has the same number of buddies. furthermore, since gv transitively permutes the set of p p-orbits adjacent to vp , either v has a unique buddy or has exactly p buddies. if v has a unique buddy z, then = , and so swapping every vertex with its unique buddy is a nontrivial semiregular automorphism. thus it remains to consider the case where v has p buddies. we rst prove the following. claim: if x is a subgroup of m that xes pointwise both ap and bp , and cp is a p-orbit adjacent to both ap and bp, then x xes cp pointwise. proof: suppose that some x x does not x c. now x xes ap pointwise, so cx must be the buddy of c with respect to ap . similarly, cx must be the buddy of c with respect to bp . these are distinct, which is a contradiction. it follows that x xes c and, since x m, also cp . let s , let = be an s-arc of and let = . now |vs mvs| = , so |mvs : mvsvs| = and |m : m| applying induction yields that |mv : m| s. we rst assume that /p and g/p are as in or of theorem . let {u, v} be an edge of . by the previous paragraph, we have |mv : muv| recall that mv xes all vertices in vp , so muv xes all vertices in vp up . combining the claim with corollary yields that muv = and thus |mv| = it follows that |m| |mv||v| so |m| |v|. on the other hand, m is an irreducible -module over gf of dimension at least two. since g/p is nonabelian simple or has a nonabelian simple group as an index two subgroup, this implies that m is a faithful irreducible -module over gf. if g/p = m, then |m| , contradicting |m| = if arc-transitive graphs of valency twice a prime g/p = psl or pgl then by , |m| / recall that p and so this contradicts |m| /s < p finally, we assume that /p is in of theorem , that is, /p is the standard double cover of a graph which appears in of theorem . in particular, v = v{, }. by lemma , has a triangle, say {u, v, w}. by corollary and lemma , /p is

"sliding window detectors assume the existence of a series of clutter measurements, from which a single measurement of the clutter level is taken. this is then compared with a cell under test , which is being tested for the presence of a target in clutter. the measurement of clutter level is then normalised in such a way that the probability of false alarm can be stabilised adaptively. in a maritime surveillance radar context, one could be examining returns from the sea surface. clutter measurements are returns from the sea surface in the absence of a target. the cell under test, in the presence of an artefact of interest, is a return which is taken independently and could consist of the signature of a boat sitting on the sea surface, for example. the analysis of these detection processes began with the pioneering work in ; a modern account can be found in . the problem of interest, in the current paper, is analysis of the cut in the presence of a target. some recent studies have suggested that the cut could be approximated by the same distribution used for the clutter, but with different distributional parameters. this is certainly the case in the context of . such an approach, in more modern situations, is suggested in , who apply an approximation from for the sum of a series of weibull distributed variables, to facilitate the derivation of the single measurement of clutter. in addition to this, an approximation is applied for the cut, relative to the additivity associated with rayleigh variates. a second, and more recent treatment, can be found in , who suggests in the case of more modern x-band maritime surveillance radar, the return in the presence of a target, can be modelled by a pareto distribution, which is also used for the clutter measurements. the difference is that the pareto parameters are modied to account for the presence of a target. this paper will show that this is a somewhat invalid assumption in the context of modern maritime surveillance radar.","Sliding window detectors in maritime surveillance radar analyze clutter measurements to detect the presence of targets. The detection process involves normalizing clutter levels for adaptive false alarm probability. Previous studies have suggested approximating clutter and target distributions with similar parameters. However, recent research in X-band radar indicates that using a Pareto distribution for both clutter and target may be invalid for modern radar systems. This presentation will address the issues with this assumption in the context of modern maritime surveillance radar."
"the cut consists of a single complex clutter measurement added to a complex target model. for the puposes of simplicity, it is assumed that the target model is bivariate gaussian. in particular, it is assumed that its in-phase and quadrature components are independent, with zero mean and variance the reciprocal of , for some > this means that the signal power is of the order the reciprocal of . this signal is denoted s througout. the complex clutter return is assumed to result from a compound gaussian process with inverse gamma texture, which yields the pareto type ii clutter model in the intensity realm . hence the clutter takes the form c = kg, where g is also a bivariate gaussian process, with independent in-phase and quadrature components, with zero mean and variance the reciprocal of the univariate process k, called the speckle, is assumed to be an independent inverse gamma distributed random variable, with density fk = tet, for t > , where is the gamma function. it can be shown that the intensity random variable i = |c| has the pareto type ii density fi = + , and corresponding distribution function fi = i p =  t +  , approximation of the cell under test january , with t in the above, parameter > is the shape, while > is the scale. the cut, in the presence of a target, is simply z = |s + c|, and the problem of interest is to determine its distribution. the approach to be examined is the assumption that there are cases where the distribution of z is also pareto distributed, but with modied shape and scale parameters.","The section outlines a problem where a complex clutter measurement is added to a bivariate Gaussian target model. The clutter is assumed to follow a Pareto Type II model and is related to a compound Gaussian process. The intensity random variable derived from this model has a Pareto Type II distribution. The challenge is to determine the distribution of z = |s + c| in the presence of a target, with the hypothesis that z may also follow a Pareto distribution with modified shape and scale parameters."
"for the scenario specied in the previous section, it is shown in that the distribution function of z is given by fz = z ueue t + u du, where t it is of interest to determine whether there are any conditions on the parameters , , and that result in being approximately pareto distributed, with a distribution function of the form . examination of the integrand in suggests it is necessary to examine approximations for its third term. towards this objective, dene a function g =  + u  = u u + . then the term under consideration can be written t = egt. one requires a reasonable approximation for , so that when applied to , and subsequently to , it becomes possible to evaluate this integral. observe that g = and limug = . furthermore g = u +  > hence g is an increasing function. note that since u > it follows that g is well dened on its domain of u since an approximation is required for g it is worth examining the construction of a taylor series for it. by successive differentiation of g it can be shown that its nth derivative is g = n+n! n u + n . one can now proceed to produce a taylor series expansion for g; expanding around u = tends to not be as advantageous as the choice of u = therefore, the relevant taylor series is given by g = g + g x k= k+ g k k, where g =  +  . applying a polynomial approximation of order or higher, based upon , to , will result in the integral in not simplifying to a pareto type distribution function, due to the complexity of the resulting integral. in order to achieve a pareto approximation it is necessary to apply a linearlisation to g. taking a linear approximation, based upon , and using the denition , it can be shown that g g u +  . inspection of shows that the linear approximation will be valid provided g << , or equivalently, << + , which is requiring to be large. when this condition is met, the term g when is applied to , it becomes possible to evaluate the integral and show that the distribution is approximately fz "" + gt # et g . this corrects a typesetting error in , where a redundant appears in the expression. approximation of the cell under test january , in view of observe that g = o    . hence for large and for xed t > , et g consequently, for large it follows that the distribution function is approximately fz "" + gt # = + t . comparing the distribution function with one concludes that in the case where is larger signicantly than , the linearlisation is valid and the distribution function is approximately pareto distributed, with shape parameter and scale parameter . note that as , fz  + t  . this result appears to suggests that there are cases where the signal plus clutter distribution can be approximated by a pareto model. however, note that is the reciprocal of the target power. hence, in cases where is large, the target power is very small. the very nature of the clutter being modelled by a pareto distribution is that it is extremely difcult to detect the presence of a low powered target in spiky x-band clutter . hence, from a practical perspective, the conditions under which the approximate pareto distribution is produced for are not really achievable or useful.","The section provides an approximation for the distribution function of a scenario discussed earlier. By defining a function g and applying a Taylor series expansion, it is shown that the distribution can be approximately represented by a Pareto distribution under certain conditions on the parameters. A linearization approach is used to simplify the integral and show that the distribution is approximately Pareto with specific shape and scale parameters. However, it is noted that this approximation may not be practically useful due to the nature of the clutter and signal distribution."
"it was shown that the distribution of signal plus clutter could be approximated by a pareto distribution, under the condition that the target model has very small power relative to the clutter level. hence, although the approximation is valid, the conditions under which it is achieved are not feasible, since a low power signal in spiky clutter will be saturated by the clutter.","In conclusion, the text demonstrates that the signal plus clutter distribution can be approximated by a Pareto distribution when the target model has significantly lower power than the clutter level. However, this approximation is not feasible in practice as a low-power signal in spiky clutter would be overwhelmed and saturated by the clutter."

"multi-echelon supply chain inventory planning using simulation-optimization with data resampling anshul agarwal abstract modeling and optimization of multi-echelon supply chain systems is challenging as it re- quires a holistic approach that exploits synergies and interactions between echelons while accurately accounting for variability observed by these systems. we develop a simulation- optimization framework that minimizes average inventory while maintaining desired average service level at stocking locations. we use a discrete-event simulation framework to accu- rately capture system interactions. instead of a parametric estimation approach, the demand and the lead time variability are quantied by bootstrap sampling the historical data, thus pre- serving the true nature of the variability. we compare three different open source simulation- optimization libraries - the derivative free methods from scipy.optimize, a bayesian optimiza- tion algorithm scikit-optimize, and a radial basis function based black-box optimizer rbfopt. the experiments demonstrate practical applicability of our approach. while we observe sub- stantially lower inventory levels and computationally superior results from rbfopt, depend- ing on the problem, search strategy, and the random start states, close enough good solution can be obtained from both rbfopt and scikit-optimize. the optimization results demonstrate a preference for a centralized inventory planning scheme that help with risk pooling. more- over, with no order placement cost, the optimal solution tends to order more frequently in order to lower inventory.","The text discusses a simulation-optimization framework for multi-echelon supply chain inventory planning.

The study compares three open-source simulation-optimization libraries and finds that the RBFOpt optimizer generates lower inventory levels and superior computational results.

"complex end-to-end supply chains utilize multiple tiers or echelons of stocking locations to not only minimize logistics costs, but also reduce inventory costs through risk pooling and efcient corresponding author, anshul.agarwal@united.com, united airlines, chicago, il , usa arxiv:v jan placement of inventory between echelons . new shipments are rst stored at a central facility, which then acts as an internal supplier to other stocking locations as the product travels through multiple stages before reaching the nal customer. in this work we address the challeng- ing problem of optimizing inventory in such complex systems. inventory optimization of a multi-echelon system can be approached by applying single-echelon optimization techniques to every echelon. however, such an approach fails to achieve true net- work inventory optimization. disregarding the network view of inventory usage and applying stand-alone replenishment strategies to one echelon without considering impact on other eche- lons can lead to redundant safety stock or customer service failure despite adequate inventory . a multi-echelon setting can lead to sophisticated complex interactions between the inventory levels of upstream and downstream stocking locations. inventory unavailability at the upstream node can increase lead time for downstream facilities. centralized upstream inventory can help downstream units to lower safety stock. upstream nodes serving customers as well as multiple downstream facilities may need to prioritize between multiple orders. large but sporadic orders from downstream units can make it challenging for the upstream facilities to follow consistent inventory management policies, and thus it can lead to higher average inventory over time. on the other hand, upstream facilities can choose a lower service level target as long as customer service levels from the downstream nodes are being met. every echelon can manage inventory with a custom policy instead of the standard reorder point or base stock approaches. modeling and optimization of such systems is therefore challenging as it requires a holistic approach that exploits such synergies and interactions between echelons . several articles address inventory optimization for multi-echelon systems (see axs ater for a review). based on the earliest model of sherbrooke , ganeshan and hopp et al. developed two-echelon models. however, they assumed a reorder point policy, poisson demand process for every echelon, and quantied expected backorders using innite series. glasserman and tayur developed a multi-period model, but assumed a base-stock policy with day review period and constant order placement. simpson , graves et al. , inderfurth et al. , and you et al. developed models for a base-stock policy using a guaranteed service time approach in which each stage quotes a guaranteed service time. for typical supply chains, where there are no quoted service time, this approach becomes very conservative with each stage planning for all previous stages lead times and thus carry unnecessary excess inventory. lee and billington and ettl et al. developed an algebraic stochastic service time approach that characterizes random lead time delay induced downstream due to stockouts at upstream units. inventory optimization literature assumes a pre-dened probability distribution (such as nor- mal or poisson), innite series, or simplied custom algebraic expressions to quantify demand and lead time variability observed in supply chains. such assumptions can simplify or inaccurately represent the true nature of variability observed. moreover, most approaches make assumptions on system interactions, inventory policy, or the product ow in the system in order to be able to solve such problems with a mathematical programming framework. we argue that this may not adequately capture the complex multi-echelon interactions described above and, as a results, can underestimate optimal inventory. therefore, in this work we follow a simulation-optimization framework to address this problem as it does not suffer from such assumptions . major contributions of this work are: instead of taking a parametric approach with a pre-decided probability distribution, the demand and the lead time variability are quantied by bootstrap sampling the historical data, thus preserving the true nature of the variability. however, we do assume no time correlation in the historical data. this can be easily relaxed by using a time-series model to forecast demand and lead time. we model the system using a exible discrete-event simulation approach. this allows us to capture sophisticated system interactions as well as any custom rules. the approach in this work is not limited to standard inventory policies such as the reorder point or base stock policies. any custom inventory policy can be incorporated. we compare three open source simulation optimization solvers: the derivative free methods from scipy.optimize , a bayesian optimization algorithm scikit-optimize , and a ra- dial basis function based black-box optimizer rbfopt . there is no published work on this comparison. the article is organized as follows. the next section describes the problem addressed in this work and the example network. further in section we describe the inventory optimization algorithm with simulation and optimization modules. we also illustrate a python implementation of the algorithm in section in section we present optimization results of the example network and a comparison of the open source solvers. section concludes the article. figure : a multi-echelon supply chain example","Complex supply chains use multiple tiers of stocking locations to minimize

"figure illustrates the multi-echelon supply chain network used in this work to demonstrate the simulation-optimization algorithm. the network comprises both elements of a multi-echelon system where a stocking facility can either purely serve customer demand or purely replenishes another facility, or does a combination of both. here the outermost stocking facilities , , and are customer facing units that directly serve customer demand. stocking facility is a central facility that, besides directly fullling customer orders, also replenishes facility facility is another central facility that mainly replenishes and it gets its replenishment from the rst facility. the rst node that replenishes facility is a supply node, such as a manufacturing plant or a vendor, for which we do not track inventory. the purpose of inventory optimization is to minimize total system costs. this can include or- der placement cost, inventory holding cost, and other miscellaneous charges such as facility costs, etc. in this work we assume no order placement cost, and mainly focus on minimizing average on- hand inventory for all stocking locations while ensuring that a minimum customer service level target is met. however, the framework presented is generic and any kinds of costs or parameters are straight-forward to incorporate. we use service level in this work . we choose to have a service level target for only customer serving facilities. thus, facility has no explicit target; though it can centrally keep inventory for nodes and in order to facilitate meeting their service level targets. the time gap between placing orders and receiving replenishment is char- acterized by an overall lead time. any unfullled customer order can either be back ordered or assumed to be lost sales; we study both cases. note that the facilities do not share their inventory levels or any other information with each other. each of them operate independently. the optimization algorithm, being cognizant of the entire system, optimizes all echelons simultaneously.","The section describes a multi-echelon supply chain network used to illustrate a simulation-optimization algorithm. The network includes stocking facilities that serve customer demand and replenish other facilities. The goal is to minimize total system costs by optimizing inventory levels across stocking locations, focusing on minimizing average on-hand inventory while meeting a minimum customer service level target. The model does not consider order placement costs and incorporates service level targets for customer serving facilities only. Order lead times and unfulfilled orders are also addressed. Each facility operates independently, and the optimization algorithm optimizes all echelons simultaneously."
"each stocking facility is replenished from only one upstream unit. all stocking units follow a combination of the reorder point and base stock policies. when the inventory position falls below the reorder point, an order of amount of (base stock level - current inventory level) is placed by the facility. we optimize both base stock and reorder point levels in this work. a replenishment order is never partially shipped. if a stocking unit does not have enough on hand inventory, it waits until there is sufcient inventory to replenish the entire order volume. such a wait adds to the downstream units lead time. serving customer order is prioritized over sending replenishment order. if multiple replenishment orders exist in the pipeline from multiple requesting facilities, they are fullled in the sequence they were received. both customer demand and lead time exhibit variability. instead of assuming a pre-dened probability distribution, we follow a data-driven distribution to quantify variability. we bootstrap samples from the historical data during simulation iterations. this inherently as- sumes that there is no time correlation in the historical demand and lead time, as well as the future will be similar to the history.","Stocking facilities are replenished from only one upstream unit using a combination of reorder point and base stock policies.

Customer orders take priority over replenishment orders, which are fulfilled in the sequence received. Both customer demand and lead time exhibit variability, quantified using a data-driven distribution derived from historical data through bootstrapping samples. This method assumes no time correlation in historical demand and lead time, with future patterns expected to resemble the past."
"we develop a simulation optimization framework to minimize inventory while ensuring a desired ll rate. in this framework, the simulation module acts as a black-box for the optimization module. the simulation process can accurately capture system dynamics. because of the black- box nature, the optimization model has visibility of the system dynamics only through the inputs to and outputs from the simulation model. the optimization model invokes simulation module multiple times for function evaluations. note that, in general, the simulation-optimization frameworks do not guarantee optimality (or even feasibility) as many algorithms do not include a strong convergence criterion . we ensure we obtain a feasible and a good quality solution by running the algorithm for several iterations. this indeed results in a computationally slower framework. however, we choose a simulation- optimization framework because: for practical inventory optimization problems, accurately capturing system interactions and dynamics is paramount a simulation model provides exibility to model a variety of multi-echelon systems with custom business rules and inventory policies. it can be easily tailored to the problem needs. the next two sections describe the simulation and optimization algorithms in detail.","A simulation optimization framework is developed to minimize inventory while maintaining a desired service level.

Subsequent sections will delve into the simulation and optimization algorithms in more detail."
"optimization solvers as mentioned above, the optimization module of the algorithm is invoked by a simulation-optimization solver, which determines the optimal decision variables. in this work we utilize and compare three open source libraries: the derivative free methods from scipy.optimize , a bayesian optimiza- tion algorithm scikit-optimize , and a radial basis function based black-box optimizer rbfopt . below we provide a brief note on the methodologies used by these solvers. scipy.optimize this is a set of optimization algorithms provided by the scipy python package. it provides various algorithms for both constrained and unconstrained optimization. the gen- eral purpose algorithms for unconstrained optimization include nelder-mead, powell, conjugate gradient , bfgs, and newton-cg. constrained optimization algorithms include l-bfgs-b, truncated newton, cobyla, slsqp, and various trust-region methods. quasi-newton strategies sr and bfgs are available to approximate hessian update. several algorithms require gradient or jacobian information to be provided. in this work we use the derivative free algorithms. scikit-optimize or skopt this is a non gradient-based optimization algorithm that minimizes expensive and noisy black-box functions. it is built on numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn python packages. it essentially utilizes a bayesian optimization approach. here the unknown objective is considered as a random function for which a prior distribution is dened using a gaussian process. function evaluations are treated as data and used to update the prior to form the posterior distribution for the objective function. this posterior is used to maximize a simple utility function. scikit-optimize also provides capabilities to, instead of a gaussian process, use random forest and xgboost algorithms to approximate the noisy functions. rbfopt this library implements the radial basis function method originally proposed by gut- mann with a few extensions. here they build and iteratively rene a surrogate model of the unknown objective function. first, for an initial set of chosen sample points that satisfy the bounds and integrality constraints, a surrogate interpolation function is built using a combination of ra- dial basis functions and polynomials. the accuracy of the surrogate model is assessed and model selection is performed automatically in the algorithm using a cross validation scheme. next step is to choose a trade-off between exploration and exploitation based on gutmanns idea of bumpi- ness. exploration implies trying to improve the surrogate model in unknown parts of the domain, whereas exploitation implies trying to nd the best objective function value based on the current surrogate model. the next point in the search space, to which the algorithm moves, is determined based on this trade-off. gutmanns algorithm provides strategies to evaluate this trade-off based on least bumpy points, and solves a local search optimization problem to determine the next iterate.","The algorithm implementation section discusses the use of three open source libraries for optimization: scipy.optimize for derivative-free methods, scikit-optimize for Bayesian optimization, and rbfopt for radial basis function-based optimization. Scipy.optimize offers a variety of algorithms for constrained and unconstrained optimization, including Nelder-Mead, Powell, conjugate gradient, BFGS, and more. Scikit-optimize utilizes a Bayesian optimization approach with Gaussian process-based modeling of the objective function. Rbfopt implements the radial basis function method with extensions, building a surrogate model of the objective function and balancing exploration and exploitation to determine the next search point."

"we demonstrate the inventory optimization algorithm and compare the open source optimization libraries on the example supply chain network shown in figure as described before, all facilities follow a combination of the reorder point and base stock policies. when the inventory position falls below reorder point, an order of amount = is placed by the facility. we optimize both base stock and reorder point levels. table : parameters for the supply chain in figure facility base service level base stock reorder point lead time target initial guess initial guess facility days % facility days % facility days % facility days % facility days % table shows the base lead time, service level target, and initial guesses for base stock level and reorder point assumed for all facilities in the supply chain. the initial guess is feasible, i.e., the facilities satisfy their respective service level target with this initial guess. the base lead time is the minimum replenishment lead time from the corresponding supplier facility. the true lead time experienced is the base lead time + a random variable component. this random variable component is obtained from the historical data. during the simulation- optimization, we bootstrap from the historical data to get this variable component. similarly, the customer demand for each facility is also bootstrapped from the historical data during simula- tions. the historical data assumed and used for this example is not correlated with time. note that in table , the service level target for facility is zero. this is not impractical. facility s role predominantly is to support replenishment for facilities and it need not have a service level target as long as it is able to help facilities and meet their service level targets, which are %, respectively. while centralized inventory at facility can pool the demand uctuation risk at and , decentralized individual inventory at both facilities and with a lower lead time can lead to a more responsive supply chain. the service level target for facility applies only to the customer demand; replenishment to facility is not accounted in calculating its service level. for the objective function we use a penalty of for not meeting the service level target. we perform simulation replications and take an average across replications for the average on-hand inventory and service level penalty for the objective function. we assume the initial inventory to be % of the base stock level for all facilities. also, each simulation is run for a days time period. both simulation and

describe our implementation strategy of each algorithm: scipy.optimize: here we run the nelder mead algorithm for cycles. in each cycle the algorithm runs for iterations. after iterations another cycle starts with the current best solution as the initial guess for this new cycle. the cycle then runs for another set of iterations. this sequence continues until we either exceed the maximum time limit of day or complete all cycles. scikit-optimize: this algorithm relies heavily on the starting random state. instead of the exploitation approach, where we run the algorithm longer for several

results when the unmet demand is considered as lost sales. for all three solvers, we compare the optimal base stock and reorder points, total number of iterations and computational time, nal value of the objective function, and how much reduction in the objective was achieved from the corresponding value for the initial guess. note that the cpu time is based on simulation replications per optimization iteration. for more replications the cpu time will increase. also, the optimal base stock and reorder points pertain to the example data used in the case study. we include them in the

methodology. because the algorithm relies more on the random starting state, while it can produce better results, the exploration approach with multiple random start states is computationally more intensive. the performance of scikit-optimize is dependent on what starting states are searched. ta- bles and illustrate the best results obtained among various tests with different random start states for the case study in this work. for a different problem, the statistics could be different. for instance, while rbfopt appears to be a clear winner when compared to scikit- optimize for the back order case, the nal optimal objective for both are quite close for the lost sales case. therefore, it is not denitive that scikit-optimize is better or worse than rbfopt. depending on the problem, search strategy, and random start states, good solu- tion can be obtained from either of the two algorithms. however, in all our tests, rbfopts results were always superior compared to the others. while we observe either comparable or higher optimal rop from rbfopt when compared to that from scikit-optimize, the base stock values are lower, especially when observed for facility , thus leading to an overall lower average inventory. the optimal rop val- ues are almost comparable across all three solvers. both scikit-optimize and rbfopt are able to achieve lower inventory by attaining lower base stock values when compared to scipy.optimize. in general, when systems consider unmet demand as lost sales instead of back ordering them, they tend to carry lower inventory on average with lower reorder points. we ob- serve this trend in our case studies with both scipy.optimize and scikit-optimize. however, rbfopt in its results show the opposite behavior. also, while scipy.optimize and scikit- optimize were faster in the lost sales case compared to back order, rbfopt took longer to complete iterations. this indicates potential for getting a more improved solution with rb- fopt for the lost sales case if it is run longer for more iterations. for both back order and lost sales scenarios, we observe that the algorithms trend towards keeping a lower rop at the customer facing facilities while compensating that with a higher rop at intermediate warehouses. this behavior is more apparent in the lost sales case. we infer that optimal systems demonstrate a preference for a centralized inventory planning and positioning scheme that help with risk pooling. we note that the optimal rop for facility from rbfopt is same as the initial guess. this indicates potential for a further improved solution from rbfopt if it is run longer for more iterations one key observation is that, for facility in the back order case, and for facilities and in the lost sales case, rbfopts solution kept base stock same as the rop. this is the inu- ence of assuming no order placement cost for our case study as the system now prefers to place frequent orders with no additional penalty. thus, it is important to make appropri- ate assumptions to model a system as it signicantly impacts the optimal solution and the behavior.","The text demonstrates an inventory optimization algorithm and compares different open-source optimization libraries using a supply chain network example. The facilities follow reorder point and base stock policies, with orders placed when inventory falls below the reorder point. The study optimizes base stock and reorder point levels across facilities. Historical data is used for replenishment lead time and customer demand assumptions. Three solvers (scipy.optimize, scikit-optimize, rbfopt) are compared based on optimal base stock and reorder points, iterations, computational time, objective function value, and reduction from initial guess. Rbfopt outperformed the other solvers in terms of objective function reduction, inventory levels, iterations, and computational time. Scikit-optimize showed better results than scipy.optimize but required more iterations and time. Depending on problem specifics, either scikit-optimize or rbfopt could provide optimal solutions. Rbfopt consistently showed superior results in the tests. Optimal solutions tend to prefer lower inventory with lower base stock values when considering lost sales. Rop values varied across solvers, indicating different inventory management strategies. Optimized systems favored centralized inventory planning for risk pooling. Making appropriate assumptions significantly impacts optimal solutions and system behavior."
"we approach the problem of optimizing inventory in multi-echelon supply chain systems by de- veloping a simulation-optimization framework. the simulation capability, by design, can model sophisticated system interactions as well as any custom rules. moreover, a black-box optimization algorithm wrapped around the simulation allows determining optimal system planning decisions while ensuring system dynamics are accurately captured. in order to preserve the true nature of the variability experienced by the system, we quantify demand and lead time variability by boot- strapping historical data. in order to demonstrate practical applicability of the framework, we test it on a -echelon ex- ample network. average inventory is minimized while ensuring that the desired average service level at stocking locations is achieved. we assume no order placement cost. because there is no single proven simulation optimization platform, we compare three open source solver packages: scipy.optimize, scikit-optimize, and rbfopt. the key conclusions from the work are as follows: while we observe substantially lower inventory levels and computationally superior results from rbfopt, depending on the problem, search strategy, and the random start states, close enough good solution can be obtained from both rbfopt and scikit-optimize. the optimization results demonstrate a preference for a centralized inventory planning scheme that help with risk pooling. because we assume no order placement cost, as expected in the optimal solution, the facili- ties tend to order more frequently in order to lower their inventory as there is no additional penalty. thus, it is important to make appropriate assumptions to model a system as it signicantly impacts the optimal solution and the modeled behavior. references anshul agarwal, multi-echelon inventory optimization, https://github.com/ anshul-musing/multi-echelon-inventory-optimization, , validation of inventory models for

simulation-optimization framework for optimizing inventory in multi-echelon supply chain systems. The framework uses a black-box optimization algorithm to determine optimal planning decisions while accurately capturing system dynamics. Demand and lead time variability are quantified using historical data. The study compares three open-source solver packages and finds that rbfopt yields lower inventory levels and superior computational results. The preference is shown for a centralized inventory planning scheme to help with risk pooling. The optimal solution tends to order more frequently in the absence of order placement costs.

"identifying clusters on a discrete periodic lattice via machine learning everest lawa adepartment of physics & astronomy and molecular computational biology program, department of biological sciences, university of southern california, los angeles, california , usa abstract given the ubiquity of lattice models in physics, it is imperative for researchers to possess robust methods for quantifying clusters on the lattice whether they be ising spins or clumps of molecules. inspired by biophysical studies, we present python code for handling clusters on a d periodic lattice. prop- erties of individual clusters, such as their area, can be obtained with a few function calls. our code invokes an unsupervised machine learning method called hierarchical clustering, which is simultaneously eective for the present problem and simple enough for non-experts to grasp qualitatively. moreover, our code transparently merges clusters neighboring each other across periodic boundaries using breadth-rst search , an algorithm well-documented in computer science pedagogy. the fact that our code is written in python instead of proprietary languages further enhances its value for repro- ducible science. keywords: hierarchical clustering, lattice simulations, breadth-rst search, periodic boundary conditions program summary program title: cluster collector licensing provisions: creative common by programming language: python nature of problem: lattice simulations of, say, membrane proteins model the spa- tiotemporal organization of a system. in order to extract insights from such sim- corresponding author. e-mail address: everestl@usc.edu preprint submitted to computer physics communications january , arxiv:v jan ulations, we need robust methods for identifying clusters of simulated objects on the lattice. solution method: hierarchical clustering rst identies all potential clusters. then, breadth-rst search connects together clusters that neighbor each other across pe- riodic boundaries.","Researchers have developed Python code using unsupervised machine learning and breadth-first search algorithms to identify clusters on a discrete periodic lattice.

The program is beneficial for lattice simulations, particularly in studying membrane proteins' spatiotemporal organization."
"there has long been an interplay between physics and subsets of machine learning, before the latter became widely known outside technical elds. for instance, clustering methods has been utilized to speed up force calculations in n-body cosmological simulations . in turn, physics has inspired new algorithms, such as super paramagnetic clustering , which was applied to image classication problems . in general, clustering methods expose natural classes within data while making as few assumptions as possible. these methods are well-documented by pedagogical publications and can be readily adopted by physicists. this paper will apply hierarchical clustering to discrete lattice systems in biophysics. these lattices arise when we model the spatiotemporal or- ganization of cell membrane proteins, the study of which would shed light on synaptic transmission , viral infections , and inter-cellular com- munication among other areas. in these lattice models, the membrane is discretized into patches according to specic biophysical considerations , with each patch described by, for instance, a kdimensional vector recording the amounts of the k chemical species present. making certain assumptions such as fast diusion within each lattice site , we can simulate the systems time evolution using gillespies algorithm; see for a recent review. given the importance of membrane protein organization, it is vital to develop techniques for identifying and describing molecular clusters on a simulation lattice. hierarchical clustering is one possible choice. to our knowledge, this technique has rst been utilized in membrane biophysics by shomar et al , who in turn were inspired by a nanoscopy experiment . the matlab clustering code in was published as part of its supple- mentary materials. unfortunately, that code does not model diusion, and therefore does not correspond to any particular boundary conditions. here we present an improved implementation which may be useful to bio- physicists and practitioners of other elds alike. first and foremost, assuming a diusive system, our code readily connects together lattice sites that touch across periodic boundaries. given the prevalence of periodic boundary con- ditions, we believe this is an important feature. second, our code is written in python, which unlike matlab is non-proprietary and free-to-use. as python becomes one of the most popular programming languages globally , we believe that research code written in python is easier to maintain and adopt for other purposes, thus leading to more reproducible scientic results. this paper is structured as follows. section gives an overview of the hierarchical clustering method. section describes the d lattices to which our code is applied, and how periodic boundaries are handled. a summary and conclusion follow in section all code can be found online at https: //github.com/openerror/physicslatticeclustering.","Physics and machine learning have a longstanding relationship, with clustering methods being used to enhance force calculations in cosmological simulations and physics-inspired algorithms like superparamagnetic clustering being applied to image classification. Hierarchical clustering, a method that reveals natural classes within data with minimal assumptions, is now being employed in biophysics to study the organization of cell membrane proteins. In this context, discrete lattice systems are utilized to model spatiotemporal aspects. A new implementation of hierarchical clustering in Python is presented, which addresses limitations of previous MATLAB code by considering diffusion and periodic boundary conditions. The improved code aims to benefit bio-physicists and researchers across various fields seeking reproducible scientific results. The paper provides an overview of hierarchical clustering, details the lattice systems and boundary handling, and concludes with a summary.

". overview of algorithm there are many implementations of hierarchical clustering , some of which are parallelized . in this paper we will work with the ag- glomerative variant, which forms clusters from the bottom-up i.e. starting from single observations . below we will give a qualitative overview of the procedure, assuming serial computations, followed by a toy example. assume that we have n observations in a d dimensional space. to begin, we need a dissimilarity measure for quantifying the dierence between observations; euclidean distance is a common choice, and a natural one when considering physical separations. with a dissimilarity measure dened, the algorithm iteratively merges the two observations or clusters that are the most similar. after n steps we obtain a single megacluster containing all the original n observations, and the algorithm terminates. to make concrete the dissimilarity d between clusters of observations, various schemes or linkages have been developed. for this work we have adopted single linkage : d = min see for example the survey on stack overow, a leading forum for exchanging ideas on software development. https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey// for all points i in cluster u and j in cluster v. in other words, we compute all pairwise dissimilarities between points from u and v, take the minimum, and let that be the dissimilarity between the two clusters. the next and nal step is to extract clusters at a desired scale from the megacluster produced. it involves retaining all clusters that are merged at a dissimilarity lower than some chosen threshold. to make this more concrete, we present a toy example below.","Hierarchical clustering is a method for grouping data points in a bottom-up approach, starting from individual observations and merging them based on similarity. The algorithm iteratively merges the most similar observations or clusters until all observations are within a single megacluster. A dissimilarity measure, such as euclidean distance, is used to quantify the difference between observations. In this work, single linkage is adopted, where the dissimilarity between clusters is defined as the minimum pairwise dissimilarity between points in the clusters. The final step involves extracting clusters at a desired scale by retaining those merged below a chosen dissimilarity threshold."
"say we have a -by- lattice with occupied sites: = , , , , , . assume that sites neighboring each other belong to the same cluster, and that only non-diagonal neighbors are consid- ered. with the stated criteria, we expect to obtain clusters. we can visualize the merger of observations and clusters through a tree- like dendrogram. the leaves nodes at the bottom of the dendrogram repre- sent the original n observations. as we move up the graph, we see the leaves merging into new nodes, which may undergo further mergers. the height in the dendrogram, at which a pair of nodes combine, indicate the dissimilarity between the nodes. the dendrogram in figure b is consistent with the hierarchical clustering described. going from the bottom to the top, we see that the sites , , , which are neighboring each other, are rst merged together. the -member cluster produced is then merged with the sites at the top left and right corners successively. in order to obtain clusters at the desired scale, we cut the dendrogram horizontally. any mergers performed above the cut are ignored, while those that occur at one level below are retained. for our particular example, any cut between unity and would work, and allow us to identify sites that touch each other through their top, bottom, left and right. in the end, we obtain four clusters as expected from the denition of clusters laid out in the beginning of section","In a -by- lattice with occupied sites, clusters are formed with neighboring sites belonging to the same cluster. A tree-like dendrogram visualizes the merging of observations and clusters. Nodes at the bottom represent original observations, merging into new nodes as we move up the graph. Height in the dendrogram indicates dissimilarity between nodes. The dendrogram demonstrates hierarchical clustering, where clusters merge based on proximity. Cutting the dendrogram horizontally at a desired scale allows for identifying clusters based on adjacency. In the example, cutting between unity and results in identifying sites touching each other in four clusters."

"when simulating large systems, periodic boundaries are commonly adopted to make computations more tractable. how then can we take into account periodic boundaries in hierarchical clustering? while it would be costly to modify an existing implementation directly, we can achieve our goal by pro- cessing the simulation lattice and the clustering output together. the logic is as follows: identify clusters that are touching the boundary, and determine the coordinates where the touching occurs. for the clusters identied, check if they neighbor each other across the periodic boundaries. if they do, consider the touching clusters as one. the above logic is implemented in the functions extractclustercoordinates and grouping, located within clustering.py and grouping.py respec- tively. the former function takes the output of detectclusters, and determines which clusters touch the boundaries. the data thus processed is then sent into grouping to generate the nal output. the function grouping returns a python list containing integer tuples, each of which describes a cluster merged across periodic boundaries or otherwise. the integers themselves correspond to each individual cluster identied and returned by detectclusters. for identical input data, scipys hi- erarchical clustering implementation would give identical cluster ids. for instance, the system depicted in figure corresponds to the output [, , ]; corresponds to the -member cluster, and are the two observations on the top left and right corners, which would be merged across periodic boundaries.","When simulating large systems with periodic boundaries in hierarchical clustering, the clusters touching the boundary are identified and their coordinates determined. To handle this, the functions extractclustercoordinates and grouping are used. extractclustercoordinates determines boundary-touching clusters, while grouping processes this data to merge clusters across periodic boundaries. The final output is a list of integer tuples representing merged clusters. This implementation ensures consistent cluster ids and allows for considering clusters across periodic boundaries in hierarchical clustering simulations."
"one non-trivial task that our code has to accomplish is to identify clusters that are touching transitively. for instance, clusters a and c may be neighbors of cluster b, but they do not touch directly. how then can we robustly identify all three of them as one single cluster? to accomplish the task above we have utilized breadth-first search , a standard technique in computer science. given a graph comprised of nodes and edges, starting from a given node bfs would nd all other nodes reachable by traversing an edge the problem of merging transitively-neighboring clusters can be trans- lated into a graph-search problem: clusters become nodes that connect to their direct neighbors through edges. given the direct connectivities between each pair of clusters, we can form a square connectivity matrix c, whose height is the same as the number of clusters. each entry cij = indicates an edge between clusters i and j; cij = otherwise. for the lattice presented in figure , the corresponding matrix c is for an illustration, see the rst : of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhx- xk figure : using bfs to identify cluster neighbors from across periodic boundaries. a) the lattice on which we ran the clustering routines. clusters and are not neighbors themselves, but they both touch cluster across periodic boundaries. therefore all three together are considered as one cluster. b) graph representing the connectivities of the clusters in a. applying bfs onto this graph, represented as a matrix c in computations, gives us the connected pieces: , , , . . since clusters touching do not involve directions, the bfs algorithm is working with an undirected graph, which leads to a symmetric matrix c. starting from any given cluster or node, bfs would nd all other nodes connected to it; repeat for all nodes and obtain the desired output. implementation-wise, the function connectedcomponents in bfs.py takes as input a matrix c; it starts at each cluster, and nds all others connected to it. finally it returns the groups of connected clusters as a python list. this is in fact what grouping does, after processing its own input to form the matrix c. for clarity, we present below pseudocode describing the entire procedure depicted in sections and array d simulation lattice if array not binarized then binarize i.e. turns into s and s, with a thresholding scheme end if hcstats detectcluster performs hierarchical clustering determine which clusters touch the boundaries lattice params { sizey: lattice height, sizex: lattice width} cluster coordinates extractclustercoordinates(hcstats, lattice params) obtain tuples of integer clusters ids cluster groups grouping","The code in discussion utilizes breadth-first search to merge clusters that are touching transitively. By treating clusters as nodes in a graph and direct connections between clusters as edges, a square connectivity matrix is formed. Applying breadth-first search on this matrix identifies all clusters connected to each other, producing the desired output of grouped clusters. The algorithm works with an undirected graph due to the lack of directions in cluster connections, resulting in a symmetric matrix. Implementation-wise, the function connectedcomponents in bfs.py takes the matrix as input, finding and returning connected cluster groups as a Python list."
"to sum up, this paper has solved a common problem in lattice simula- tions, using only a combination of standard techniques from machine learning and computer science. all algorithms used namely, hierarchical clustering and breadth-rst search are well-documented, and optimized implementa- tions of clustering are easily available as pre-built libraries. we hope that our work would inspire further imports of information-technological techniques into physics. although this paper has only worked on d lattices, with a few modi- cations the same code can be applied to a rectangular d lattice. however, for more complicated geometries substantial edits would be necessary. in particular, we may need a new measure for the dissimilarity between ob- servations, in addition to alternative methods for handling boundary points or even non-periodic boundary conditions. non-trivial geometries arise in attempts to accurately describe molecular diusion on cellular membranes , and present additional needs for appropriate analytical techniques.","This paper successfully addresses a common problem in lattice simulations by utilizing standard machine learning and computer science techniques, specifically hierarchical clustering and breadth-first search. The algorithms used are well-documented with optimized implementations readily available. The work suggests the integration of information technological techniques into physics. While the focus is on d lattices, the code can be adapted for rectangular lattices with minimal changes. However, complex geometries may require significant modifications, such as new dissimilarity measures for observations and alternative approaches for boundary points or non-periodic conditions. These challenges are particularly relevant for modeling molecular diffusion on cellular membranes."

corresponding to step of tates algorithm . in m-theory and f- theory compactications, such geometries produce e gauge theories (respectively in ve- and six- dimensional spacetime with eight supersymmetric generators), with matter transforming in the adjoint and the fundamental representation of e of dimension we will denote that representation as in the rest of the paper. flops between distinct crepant resolutions are then interpreted as phase transitions between distinct coulomb chambers of the n = ve-dimensional gauge theory. the intersection polynomial is not invariant under ops and has to be computed in each of the crepant resolutions. the last few years have seen a deep improvement of our understanding of the geography of crepant resolutions of weierstrass models. crepant resolutions of a singular weierstrass model are relative minimal models over the weierstrass model and are connected to each other by a nite sequence of ops. one signicant incomplete problem at the boundary between birational geometry and string geometry is the explicit construction of all the crepant resolutions of a given weierstrass model coming from tates algorithm . the geography of these crepant resolutions is the study of the network of ops connecting them. it is natural to ask what is the geography of the minimal models corresponding to a given weierstrass model: how many such minimal models are there? what is the graph of their ops? the systematic investigation of the geography of minimal models of weierstrass models started with the study of the crepant resolutions of the su-model and has been completed for g-models with g a simple complex lie group of low-rank such as su , g, spin, spin , and f . semi-simple cases and cases with non-trivial mordellweil groups have also been investigated recently . there are still some important omissions. with the exception of innite series, e=spin, e and e are the two crucial cases left for which the details of the crepant resolutions dening each chamber are still a mystery. the e-model corresponds to a kodaira ber ivs covered by step of tates algorithm while the e-model corresponds to the kodaira ber iiiand step of tates algorithm. we would like to start a detailed exploration of the minimal models of the e-model. in this context, minimal models are crepant resolutions over the weierstrass model. we would like to explicitly construct each minimal model over the weierstrass model as a projective variety dened by a crepant resolution of the weierstrass model of an e-model and study the geography of these dierent crepant resolutions. an e weierstrass model is conjectured to have eight distinct crepant resolutions whose op diagram is a dynkin diagram of type e however, to this day, these crepant resolutions have not been identied. we will construct four of the eight conjectured minimal models of an e-model and show that their ops dene a dynkin diagram of type d in our construction, the birational geometry of the suspended pinch point will be used to model the ops of the minimal we attach a graph to the collection of minimal models of a weierstrass model such that the nodes of the graph are in bijection with the minimal models and two nodes are connected by an edge when the two corresponding minimal models are connected by a op. such a graph is called the graph of ops of the minimal models. if the elliptic bration is a calabi-yau threefold, the graph of ops corresponds to the incidence graph of the distinct chambers of the coulomb branch of the ve-dimensional gauge theory obtained by a compactication of m-theory on the elliptic bration. models we discuss. dening the e-model an e-model is an elliptic bration y b over a smooth base b with a choice of a smooth prime divisor s in the base b such that the ber over the generic point of s is of kodaira type iii and all singular bers over generic points of the discriminant locus away from s are irreducible (of kodaira type ii or i). the name e-model stems from the fact that the dual graph of a kodaira ber of type iiiis the ane dynkin diagram of type e e e-models are typically given by singular weierstrass models using step of tates algorithm, which can be traced to proposition of nrons thesis . let b be a smooth variety of dimension two or higher over the complex numbers. given a line bundle l , we dene the projective bundle of lines : x = pb b. the projective bundle x is the ambient space for a weierstrass model . let ox be the dual of the tautological line bundle of x, a weierstrass model is by denition the zero scheme of a section of the line bundle ox l throughout this paper, we work over the complex numbers c. given sections fi of lines bundles li, we denote by v their vanishing scheme dened as the zero scheme f = f = = fr = if we denote the relative projective coordinates of x as , a weierstrass model is the following vanishing locus v , where f is a section of l and g is a section of l the discriminant and the j-invariant are given by the following expressions = f + g, j = f . the divisor is a section of the line bundle l the locus of points of b over which the ber is singular is v . the bers of a smooth weierstrass model are all irreducible of type i (smooth elliptic curve), i , and ii . reducible bers appear only after resolving the singularities of a singular weierstrass model up to codimension-two. the general weierstrass equation is yz + axyz + ayz x axz axz az = let s = v be a smooth and irreducible cartier divisor in a smooth variety b. we denote the generic point of s and its residue eld by and , respectively. we dene a valuation vs such that vs = n when a rational function f has a zero of multiplicity n if n or a pole of multiplicity n if n < an e-model is characterized by step of tates algorithm and corresponds to type in nrons classication . following proposition of , an e-model is characterized by the following restrictions on the valuations of the coecients of the weierstrass equation: vs , vs , vs , vs = , vs after completing the square in y and the cube in x, an elliptic bration with generic ber of kodaira type iiiover s = v can always be written as the following weierstrass model yz = x + a,sxz + a,+s+z, z, where ai,j is a section of l i s j where s = ob. such an elliptic bration is called an e-model. in this paper, we focus on the case = and, to ease the notation, we will write the weierstrass model as follows yz = x + asxz + bsz, where s = v is a smooth cartier divisor dened by the zero locus of a section of the line bundle s , a is a section of l s , and b is a section of l s we assume that a and b have zero valuation along s and v and v are smooth divisors in b intersecting transversally. the discriminant locus of this weierstrass model is the vanishing scheme of with = s the reduced discriminant locus consists of two prime divisors, namely s = v and = v . the divisor has cuspidal singularities at v that worsen to triple point singularities over v . the divisors s and do not intersect transversally as their intersection scheme consists of triple points . since the generic point of is regular, we can still apply tates algorithm along . the ber over the generic point of s has kodaira type iiiand the generic ber over is of kodaira type i the collision of singularities iii+i is not in the list of miranda as the two bers have distinct j-invariant. we do expect a degeneration of the ber iiiover the the codimension-two locus v of the base b and further at the codimension-three loci v . e facts and conjectures in this section, we recall some facts and conjectures about the e-model that are relevant to appre- ciate the questions addressed in this paper. topological invariants. the hodge numbers and the euler characteristic of a crepant reso- lution are invariant under ops and can therefore be computed in any crepant resolution. the euler characteristic over a base of arbitrary dimension of an e-model has been computed in . the hodge numbers and the euler characteristic of an e-model in the special case of an elliptically bered calabi-yau threefold that is obtained by a crepant resolution of a weierstrass model are independent of the choice of crepant resolution and are given in . the key point is that the euler characteristic is = k k s s = k + + s the characteristic numbers of an e-model are computed in . see also . singular bers of bral divisors and the minuscule representation the ber of type iiidegenerates over the collision of s and . the irreducible rational curves forming the singular ber over s have geometric weights in the representation of e, which is a minuscule fundamental representation. thus, the matter representation associated with an e-model is the direct sum of the adjoint and the fundamental representation of e non-higgsable cluster. the representation does not occur when s and do not intersect. this is famously illustrated by the non-higgsable cluster corresponding to the local calabi-yau threefold dened over the quasi-projective surface given by the total space of the line bundle op see . loss of atness. when the base of the bration is at least of dimension three, a crepant resolution of the e-model does not give a at bration over the base as there are codimension- three points over which the ber contains a full quadric surface as discussed in the partial toric resolutions of . we will see that this happens exactly over the intersection of s with the singular locus of , namely over the codimension-three locus v in the base b. the geography of crepant resolutions. the authors of conjectured that there are eight crepant resolutions of the weierstrass model of an e-model and the graph of their ops is a dynkin diagram of type e this is based on studying the hyperplane arrangement dened by the weights of the representation inside the dual fundamental weyl chamber of e the crepant resolutions were not constructed explicitly. see also . the ber structure. the authors of also conjectured that the crepant resolution cor- responding to the i of e is such that the generic ber over s degenerates over v to a non-kodaira ber whose dual graph is the same as the ane dynkin diagram of type e e with the node i contracted to a point. this has not been veried geometrically in more than one chamber. summary of results the key results of this paper are the following: we give four distinct crepant resolutions of the weierstrass model of the e-model. we show that the graph of the ops between these four crepant resolutions is a d-dynkin subdiagram of the expected e op-diagram as illustrated in figure . more specically the resolutions correspond to the nodes , , , and of the dynkin diagram of type e of figure . for that reason, we call these resolutions y, y, y, and y, respectively. we show that the d-dynkin diagram of ops can be understood by the ops of two suspended pinch points as illustrated on figure . we show that in the resolution yi , the generic ber over v corresponds to the dynkin diagram of type e e with the node i contracted to a point. for each resolution, we identify the new curves that appear over v . they are extreme rays of the resolution and their geometric weights are always in the minuscule representation in particular, we nd the ve extreme rays corresponding to the weights , , , , as illustrated on figure . we also show that in each of the four crepant resolutions studied in this paper, the divisor d corresponding to the root has a ber that jumps in dimension over the codimension-three locus v . all other bers are always one dimensional over any point of the base. we compute the triple intersection numbers of the bral divisors and in this way give a geometric derivation of the chern-simons levels and of the superpotential of an e-model in the four chambers studied in this paper. we compute the number of hypermultiplets in an m-theory compactication on a calabi-yau threefold that is an e-model by comparing the triple intersection numbers with the one- loop corrected superpotential of a ve-dimensional supergravity theory with lie group e and matter transforming in the adjoint and the fundamental representation . as expected, the number of adjoints is the genus of the curve supporting the ber iiiand the number of fundamentals is given by the number of intersection points between the two irreducible components of the reduced discriminant locus: n = g, n = s =  + s . but this intersection is not transverse as s and intersect along the scheme which consists of triple points supported on v . the factor of / indicates that each intersection point contributes one half-hypermultiplet, which is possible because the representation is pseudo-real. when s is a rational curve, n = if s is a rational curve of self-intersection s = , we get n = while when it is a rational curve of self-intersection s = we get n = /, which corresponds to a unique half-hypermultiplet. for convenience, we collect our results in the following pages. ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch figure : adjacency graph of the chambers of the hyperplane arrangement i. each cham- ber is

bration dened over the complex numbers, so that is a proper morphism between complex quasi-projective varieties. we will assume that the base b of the bra- tion is a smooth complex variety and denote the discriminant locus by . under mild assumptions, is a cartier divisor. inspired by the physics of f-theory, we attach to the elliptic bration : y b a unique reductive complex lie group g and a representation r of its lie algebra g = lie. the lie algebra g is uniquely dened by the dual graphs of the singular bers of over the generic points of its discriminant locus , and is referred to as a g-model. the irreducible components of the singular bers over codimension-two points of the base deter- mine a nite set of weights belonging to the representation r. determining r from these weights is particularly straightforward when r is a -minuscule representation, as in that case all the weights of r are then by denition in the same weyl orbit. the group g is such that its rst homotopy group is isomorphic to the mordellweil group of , and r is a representation of g. several aspects of the geometry of the elliptic bration are controlled by the triple . m-theory compactied on a calabiyau threefold given by a g-model results in an n = ve- dimensional gauged supergravity theory with gauge group g. in the language of ve-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges, each distinct crepant resolution of the weier- strass model corresponds to a dierent chamber of the coulomb branch of the theory. string duali- ties suggest that the graph of ops between distinct minimal models is isomorphic to the adjacency graph of the chambers of the hyperplane arrangement i whose hyperplanes are the kernels of the weights of the representation r restricted to the dual fundamental weyl chamber of g. this picture requires that the elliptic bration is a calabi-yau threefold, but we expect that the hyper- plane arrangement is valid in a larger setup than the calabi-yau threefold case and even relevant to study varieties more general than elliptic brations. for example, it can be extended to the case of q-factorial terminal singularities that are partial resolutions of threefolds with cdv singularities. geography of minimal models: decomposition of the relative movable cone into relative nef-cones. the description of the coulomb branch of a ve-dimensional gauge theory with gauge algebra g and a representation r in terms of a hyperplane arrangement i is strikingly similar to the point of view of birational geometers who rely on several cones to describe the birational geometry of projective varieties in the same birational class. in particular, we refer to section of mat- suki and to kawamatas seminal paper for a description of the relative movable cone and if i are the irreducible components of the reduced discriminant and pi is the generic point of i, the langlands dual of the dual graph of the ber over pi has an ane dynkin type e gi and the lie algebra g is the direct sum g = l i gi. by denition, the kodaira type associated to a component i is the type of the geometric ber over pi. the dual graph of a kodaira ber is always an ane dynkin diagram of type ade. we assume that at least one component i of the reduced discriminant has a reducible ber over its generic point, that is, a kodaira ber of type dierent from type ii and type i its decomposition theorem into relative nef-cones. let : y b be an elliptic bration. let f : y w be the birational map to its weierstrass model. then f contracts all bral divisors not touching the zero section of the bration. in the case of an elliptic surface, that is enough to see that the weierstrass model is the canonical model of y . when an elliptic bration has a trivial mordell-weil group, the bral divisors dm and the zero section generate the relative nron-severi cone n given a crepant resolution f : x w of a weierstrass model, the relative picard number gives the rank of the gauge group and n is generated by the bral divisors dm not touching the zero section. each relative one-cycle denes a map n z via the intersection. the geometric weights of a relative -cycle c is a vector z given by the negative of the intersection numbers with the bral divisors not touching the section of the elliptic bration : m = x di c, where di are the bral divisors not touching the section of the elliptic bration. each relative one-cycle denes a hyperplane in n: = {d n| x = }. each divisor di is a bration over s and we denote its generic ber by ci. the curves ci generate an open convex cone in n we denote the open dual cone in n by d: d = {d n| i x } = \ i= this cone corresponds to the dual weyl chamber of g. geometrically, we expect d to be the cone of relative movable divisors mov. a pseudo-isomorphism is a birational map that is an isomorphism in codimension-one. a small q-factorial modication is a pseudo-isomorphism between q-factorial projective varieties. given a sqm between two varieties x and x, we get naturally an associated identifcation of the of the nron-severi groups n and n via pullback and pushforward. any nef-divisor is movable and the partition theorem implies that any movable divisor becomes nef after a nite number of ops. for any two q-factorial varieties y and y related by a bira- tional map that is an isomorphism in codimension-one, the cones n and n can be canonically identied by pushforward and pullback. we also identify in this way some other important subcones of n and n such as the relative movable cones mov, the ample cones amp, and the big cones big amp mov big n the closure of the ample cone is the nef-cone. in ideal cases, we expect that the relative movable cone decomposes as a union of relative nef-cones of all the minimal models in the same birational orbit: mov = g i amp, where the union is over all minimal models in the same birational class of y and the interiors of the cones amp are disjoint. since the pullback of an ample divisor is movable, the identication of n and n also embeds the ample cone of x onto a subcone of the movable cone of x the partition theorem states that if we x a given minimal model x, the nef-cones of the other minimal models xi embedded into subcones of the movable cone of x will provide a partition of the movable cone of x. the hyperplane arrangement i describes the decomposition of the closed relative movable cone into relative nef-cones corresponding to each individual distinct crepant resolution. elliptic bration hyperplane arrangement cones weierstrass model closed dual weyl chamber of g mov crepant resolution chambers of i amp the hyperplane arrangement i in this section, we review the construction of the root systems e, e, and the fundamental repre- sentation of e we then study the chamber structure of the hyperplane arrangement i. e root system and dynkin diagram the lie algebra of type e has dimension and rank : it has distinct roots and its cartan subalgebra has dimension its weyl group has order . the coxeter number of the lie algebra of type e is the determinant of the cartan matrix of the lie algebra of type e is hence, the fundamental group of the root system of type e and the quotient of the weight lattice modulo the root lattice are both isomorphic to z/z. a choice of positive simple roots is = , = , = , = , = , = , = . the cartan matrix of e is then the ith row of this cartan matrix gives the coordinates of the simple root i in the basis of simple fundamental weights. in bourbakis tables, our simple roots are denoted , respectively. figure : ane dynkin diagram of type e e removing the black node gives the dynkin diagram of type e the numbers inside the nodes are the multiplicities of the kodaira ber of type iii and the dynkin labels of the highest root. thus, the coxeter number of e is the root is the highest weight of the adjoint representation while is the highest weight of the fundamental represenation figure : ane dynkin diagram of type e e removing the black node gives the dynkin diagram of type e the number in the nodes are the multiplicities of the kodaira ber of type ii. root system of types e and e, and representation of e we now give a quick description of the root system of type e and the weight system of e in terms of the root system of type e we follow borcherdss lecture notes on lie groups . the smallest non-trivial representation of e is of dimension and often called the fundamental representation. the representation of e is minuscule, self-dual, and pseudo-real. its highest weight is the simple root . the roots of e form the unique eight dimensional even unimodular lattice. the roots of e are the vertices of the gosset polytope ( in coxeters notation). the roots of e are the vertices of the polytope the weights of are the vertices of a delaunay polytope also called the hesse polytope by conway and sloane. the lie algebra of type e has the following decomposition under the maximal subalgebra e a: e = . the roots of e are the following vectors of r all located on a seven-dimensional sphere of radius : by denition, the root system e consists of the subsystem of roots of e perpendicular to a chosen root s of e the weyl group w preserves the scalar product between roots. all the roots of e can be organized by their scalar products with respect to the chosen root s of e since the root system e is crystallographic and simply-laced, the scalar product of two roots can only take one of the following ve values: , , , +, + then, the following facts are directly proven by using the scalar product: there is a unique root r such that = , namely s . there are roots perpendicular to s, they form an e root system. there are roots r of e with scalar product = , we call them + (resp. ). each of form a weight system of the irreducible representation of e translation by s gives an isometry between the weight systems + and corresponding to the hyperplane reection induced by the root s. the involution r r of e exchanges + and using the scalar product of e, the weight system + is composed of the closest roots to s. they are all on a sphere of radius centered at the ane point ps dened by the vector s. the roots of e are all on the plane perpendicular to the vector s on a sphere of radius centered at the ane point ps corresponding to the vector s. the vectors of the weight system are on a sphere of radius centered at the point ps. the root s is the further away at a distance the root system e dened by = and the two representations are on parallel hyperplanes. consider the root s = of e we can write an e root system by listing the roots of e perpendicular to s: we can also determine the weights of the representation corresponding to + by enumerating the roots of e with scalar product + with s: the opposite of these vectors form the weight system the representation is invariant under the group generated by the involutions r s r and the reection s : r r + s. in the basis of fundamental weights, the weights of the representation are listed with the corresponding hasse diagram is given in figure . figure : hasse diagram for the weights of the representation of e the node i represents the weight i given above and written in the basis of fundamental weights. a root between two nodes i and j indicates that j = i . the white nodes are those corresponding to the weights used to dene the sign vector that characterizes the chambers of the hyperplane arrangement i. in a given chamber of i, each white node takes a specic sign ). the red (resp. blue) nodes correspond to weights in the positive conical hull of positive roots. in particular, a white node corresponds to a weight such that the hyperplane intersects the interior of the dual fundamental weyl chamber while that is not the case for a weight corresponding to a blue or red node. chamber structure of the hyperplane i the following theorem was given in without a formal proof. we give a proof here using the language of sign vectors in the spirit of . theorem . the hyperplane arrangement i has eight chambers. each chamber is simpli- cial. the adjacency graph of the chambers is isomorphic to the dynkin diagram of type e proof. since the minuscule representation of e is self-dual, it is enough to consider only half of its weights to study the hyperplane arrangement i. the weights that do not intersect the interior of the dual fundamental weyl chamber are such that all their coecients have the same sign when expressed in the basis of simple positive roots. after removing such weights, we are left with seven weights, listed in figure . they have an elegant structure as all can be derived from the smallest one by removing only one root, always dierent from (, , , , , - , ) - (, , , , , - , ) - - (, , , , , - , ) - - (, , , , , - , ) - - (, , , - , , - , ) - - (, , , - , -, - , ) - (, , , , , - , - ) - - in the rst column, the weights are written in the basis of simple roots, while in the second column, they are written in the basis of simple fundamental weights. we denote by an element of the coroot space. when writing in coordinates, we use the basis of simple coroots. since, by denition, the simple coroots are dual to the fundamental weights, the scalar product is dened using the identity matrix. we dene a sign vector for the hyperplane arrangement i as follows: , which gives =( , + , + , + + , + + , + , ). the open dual fundamental weyl chamber of e is dened as the cone > with i = {, , , , , , }. each chamber is uniquely dened by the signs of entries of the vector when evaluated at any interior point of the chamber. the weights have a partial order dened by adding positive simple roots: i j if i j is a nonnegative integer linear combination of positive roots. in each weight of the representation has norm square / and has scalar product / with any other weight of our choice of signs for the entries of the sign vector is such that the highest weight has a sign . particular, the partial order for the weights that are interior walls is : , thus, writing the sign vector as in figure , we have the following rule: the negative sign ows as the arrows of figure . the forms and cannot both be positive at the same time. for example, if is negative, the same is true of all the i with i = {, , , , , }. the second rule is justied by the fact that + = and we are restricted to the dual weyl chamber. to dene a chamber, we just need to name which one of the i is the rst negative one with respect to the order given above. if both and are positive, then , , and are all positive, is necessarily negative , which forces to also be negative. there are exactly eight possibilities satisfying these two rules. they are listed in table and we check explicitly by solving inequalities that they all occur. their adjacency graph is a dynkin diagram of type e illustrated in figure where we label the chambers by the corresponding simple roots of e = - = - - = - - = - - = - - = - - = - figure : up to a sign, there are seven weights of the representation of e such that each of them has a kernel intersecting the interior of the dual fundamental weyl chamber. the partial order of weights provide the hasse diagram presented above and corresponding to a decorated dynkin diagram of type e we write i j to indicate that i = j. the linear forms dened by these weights give the sign vector for the hyperplane arrangement i. minimal models y, y, y, and y in this section, we construct four distinct relative minimal models over the weierstrass model of an e-model as crepant resolutions of the weierstrass model in equation . we also study the ops between these distinct crepant resolutions. these relative minimal models correspond to chambers ch, ch, ch, and ch of the hyperplane arrangement i discussed in section . accordingly, we denote these mimimal models by y, y, y, and y we can tell them apart by identifying the extreme rays of de crepant resolution over the weierstrass model. to each extreme ray c, we associate a unique weight of the representation of e the identication is given by computing minus the intersection of the curve c with the bral divisors di not touching the section of the elliptic bration. the ops between the four minimal models y, y, y, and y form a dynkin diagram of type d as illustrated in figure . overview of the sequence of blowups dening the resolutions each of the models y, y, y, and y can be obtained by numerous sequences of blowups. we give two distinct resolutions for y and y to ease the description of the ops. we will give two trees of blowups dening respectively crepant resolutions of the triples and . the ops within each of these triples will be modeled by the ops of a suspended pinch point. the graph of ops of a suspended pinch point is a dynkin diagram of type a and gluing two such dynkin diagram along two consecutive nodes gives a d-dynkin diagram. for us, the two consecutive nodes will correspond to y and y and this explains why we give two distinct resolutions for these two minimal models. conventions for blowups. each crepant resolution is an embedded resolution dened by a sequence of blowups with smooth centers. we denote the blowup xi+ xi along the ideal with exceptional divisor e as: xi xi+ , where x is the projective bundle in which the weierstrass model is dened. we abuse notations and call the proper transforms of the variables involved in the blowup by the same name. that means for example that we implement by the birational transformation with the understanding that we introduce at the same time projective coordinates which are the projective coordinates of the ber of a pn-bundle introduced by the blowup. in particular, after the blowup, cannot vanish simultaneously as they are projective coordinates of a pn if we blowup a regular sequence and the dening equation has multiplicity n along v , then by adjunction, it is easy to see that the embedded blowup denes a crepant map. the sequence of blowups that we consider for the resolutions y and y, and to understand the ops between y, y, and y, are the following x+ x x x x x x x x x x where x is the projective bundle in which the weierstrass model is dened. we work with embedded resolutions. the minimal models y, y, and y are obtained as the proper transform of the weierstrass model in x+ , x , and x , respectively. to understand the ops between y, y, and y, we consider the following tree of blowups: x+ x x x x x x x x x where y, y, and y are obtained as the proper transform of the weierstrass model in x+ , x , and x , respectively. conventions for cartan divisors and bers. we denote the bral divisors by dm where m = , , . . . , and d is the divisor touching the zero section of the elliptic bration. by denition, each dm is a bration of a rational curve over the divisor s in the base. we denote the generic curve of dm by cm. the intersection numbers y dm cn are minus the cartan matrix of the ane dynkin diagram of type e e the bral divisors not touching the section are denoted di with i = , , . . . , we recall that the weight of a vertical curve c is by denition the vector of minus its intersection number with the bral divisors: ( y d c, y d c, . . . , y d c). they are not independent, as the linear combination with coecients gives zero. for that reason, it is enough to compute only the intersection with the di, which gives a vector in the weight lattice of e these coecients are the multiplicities of the node of the ber iiiand also correspond to the dynkin labels of the highest root of e with one given for the extra node. the geometry of y we study the minimal model y using the resolution discussed in equation . y is then the proper transform of the weierstrass model of equation after the blowups leading to x+ in equation . the result is: y : eey eee(eee x + aesx + be eee s) = the relative projective coordinates are: [eeee ee x : ee e e e e y : s][x : eeee e y : eeee ] [eeeey : e : eee ]. the divisor for the special ber is seee ee e e the bral divisors are: d : s = ey ee ee x = d : e = y = d : e = e = d : e = eey ee eee x ae eesx = d : e = e = d : e = e = d : e = beeee s + ax = d : e = eee x + aes = we denote by ca the generic ber of the bral divisor da. all the bral divisors are p-bundles with the exception of d and d remark . one might think that the curve c degenerates at a = however, that is not the case because when a = , the dening equation for c gives e = eee x = since e and eex cannot vanish simultaneously, as is clear by looking at the projective coordinates, we deduce that over v s, the curve c simplies to c : a = e = e = but does not degenerate. it follows that d, d, d, d, and d are p-projective bundles. the degeneration at a = gives: ( c c + c , c c + c + c, where c : a = e = ey ee ee x = , c : a = e = e = only c and c are new rational curves produced by the degeneration at v . they are extreme rays. the geometric weights of these curves are: ( c = - - = , c = - = the two weights and are weights of the representation and uniquely characterize the chamber ch of the hyperplane arrangement i. taking into account the multiplicities of the curves c, c, and c, we have c + c c + c + c + c together with the remaining curves, we get a ber of type ii(with dual ber the ane dynkin diagram e e) but with the node of multiplicity (the node of e e) contracted to a point as illustrated on figure . remark . we also note that the ber c over v jumps in dimension and becomes a quadric surface. thus the resolution of the e-ber does not give a at elliptic bration when the base is a threefold and a and b can vanish simultaneously on s. no other ber component jumps in dimension. figure : the resolution in chamber has a ber e that degenerates to a ber of type iiwith the node contracted to a point. the geometry of y we study the minimal model y

hypersurfaces are simple algebraic varieties. they can be instrumental in our understand- ing of ops between minimal models over a weierstrass model. for example, the binomial variety in c dened by the hypersurface uu www = , has six crepant resolutions whose graph of ops is a hexagon (an ane dynkin diagram of type e a). the op diagram of this binomial variety matches those of the spin-model and also denes the hexagon of ops of the su model . the pinch point is the singular surface dened by the following binomial equation in c: x yz = the whitney umbrella is not a normal surface as it has singularities in codimension-one. the whitney umbrella plays an important role in the geometry of weak coupling limits . the suspended pinch point appears in other areas of string geometry . the suspended pinch point is a threefold dened as the double cover of c branched along a whitney umbrella. its dening equation in c is u = x yz. after a change of variables , the suspended pinch point becomes the following binomial hypersurface in c: z : uu = uu the singularities of the suspended pinch point are in codimension-two, more precisely, the singular locus is the line u = u = u = and the singularity worsens at the origin. the variety is normal and has three distinct crepant resolutions whose graph of ops is a dynkin diagram of type a the three crepant resolutions of the suspended pinch points are presented algebraically in figure . we also give a toric description of all the crepant partial resolutions in figure . the algebraic crepant resolutions given in figure should be compared to the right tails of the trees of resolutions presented in equations and . this explains why the ops between the minimal models y, y, y, and y are inspired by those of the suspended pinch point. blowing up by (r u, r u) with exceptional divisor r = , the proper transform of z is z : uu uu = the variables [ u : u] are the projective coordinates of a p, in particular, u and u cannot vanish at the same time. it follows that z is singular at u = u = u = , which is dened in the patch u = in that patch, z is isomorphic to the cylindrical quadric cone c, where the z involution is generated by minus the identity of c as a hypersurface in c, it is given by the zero locus of x yz = , where c is parametrized by (r, x = u, y = u u, z = u). this cone has a unique crepant resolution obtained, for example, by blowing up . for z, we blowup using the birational map ( ur, ur), where r = is the exceptional divisor. the proper transform is the crepant z z z : uu uu = z z z op ( u, r) ( u, u) op ( u, u) figure : the three crepant resolutions of the suspended pinch point z : uu uu = in the blowup dening z, r = is the exceptional locus of the previous blowup dening z, i.e. r is the exceptional locus of the blowup of z centered at u = u = the ops between z, z, and z denes a dynkin diagram of type a and are all atiyah ops as shown in figure . resolution z : r u u u u = we get the other two crepant resolutions of z by rst blowing up with the birational map ( ur, ur), which gives the proper transform z : ur u uu = the variables [ u : u] are the projective coordinates of a p, in particular, u and u cannot vanish at the same time. the singular locus of z is u = r = u = u = this singularity is dened in the patch u = and is a quadric cone k/, where x = u, y = r, z = u/ u, and u u such a quadric cone has two crepant resolutions connected by an atiyah op and obtained by blowing up and , respectively. for z , we obtain the two crepant resolutions z and z by blowing up z at ( u, r) and ( u, u), respectively. the suspended pinch point can also be described as a particular partial resolution of the z z orbifold quotient of c : c/ : u uuu = where the klein group z z is generated by the two involution and consider the blowup centered at . in one patch, we have which gives the proper transform uu = uu the diagram of ops of the crepant resolutions of this orbifold is also a d-dynkin diagram as seen in figure . figure : flops between the three crepant resolutions of the suspended pinch point zu = xy and all its toric partial resolutions. the suspended pinch point is at the bottom row. the three crepant resolutions are on the top row. the four partial resolutions are in the middle row. the external varieties of the middle row have the singularities of a cylindrical quadric cone k/ while the others have singularities of a quadric threefold with a double point k/. figure : flops between the four crepant resolutions of the singularity k/. this binomial variety is

figure : some of the singular binomial varieties encountered in this paper. spp opping between y, y, y, and y the ops connecting y, y, and y can be easily understood using the tree of blowups given in equation . consider the proper transform y of the weierstrass equation after the four blowups dening x in equation . by denition, y is a common blowdown of y, y, and y it can be written in the following suggestive form ): y : e(ey aesx + be e s) ee = in the patch exys = , it has the following structure y : eq = ee , q = (ey aesx + be e s)/. we recognize this as a suspended pinch point singularity at the origin e = q = e = e = such a singularity admits three crepant resolutions described by the tail of the tree of blowups in and mimic the blowups in figure . the same story hold for the ops between the minimal models y, y, and y by considering the proper transform of the weierstrass model after the rst ve blowups dened in the tree of equation . after these ve blowups, the proper transform of the weierstrass model of an e-model takes the following form : ey eee(eee x + aesx + be es) = since when e = y = , ee is nonzero by the projective coordinates in equation . thus, we again have an equation of the form ey = ea. we recognize the form of the binomial variety of a suspended pinch point. we then derive y, y, and y as its three crepant resolutions following the discussion of section . the last three blowups in each branch of the tree presented in equation mimic the resolutions of the suspended pinch points as given in section . application to n = ve-dimensional theories m-theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold results in a ve-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory with eight supercharges that we denote n = ve-dimensional supergravity. such a theory contains a gravitational multiplet, nt tensor multiplets, nv vector multiplets, and nh hypermulti- plets. in ve-dimensional spacetime, a massless tensor multiplet is dual to a massless vector. in what follows, we assume that all tensors are massless and are dualized to vectors. each vector multiplet contains a real scalar eld and each hypermultiplet contains a quaternion . the kinetic terms of all the vector multiplets and the graviphoton as well as the chern-simons terms are determined by a real function of the scalar elds called the prepotential f. in the coulomb branch of an n = supergravity theory in ve dimensions, the scalar elds of the vector multiplets take values in the cartan sub-algebra of the lie algebra and the lie group is broken y y y y y y y y y y a a d figure : the triples and both form an a dynkin diagram where the nodes are the varieties and two nodes are connected if they are related by a op as shown on the left and middle pictures. for each of the triples, the ops mirror those of a suspended pinch point. by identifying y and y of the two triples with themselves, we end up gluing the two a to form a d dynkin diagram representing all the ops between y, y, y, and y to a product of abelian factors. this implies that the charge of a hypermultiplet is simply a weight of the representation under which it transforms . in the presence of hypermultiplets charged under a representation r of the gauge group, the coulomb phase of the theory is characterized by a one-loop quantum correction to the superpotential derived by integrating out massive hypermultiplets. the full quantum superpotential f is protected from further corrections by supersymmetry and is a piecewise cubic polynomial of the scalar elds. the metric of the scalar elds of the vector multiplets is the matrix of second derivatives of f and it is dierentiable in open regions that dene distinct coulomb branches separated by walls on which some of the massive hypermultiplets become massless and should be added to the low energy description of the theory. the intrilligator-morrison-seiberg prepotential is the quantum contribution to the prepotential of a ve-dimensional gauge theory after integrating out all massive elds. let be in the cartan subalgebra of a lie algebra g. we denote by ri the representations under which the hypermultiplets transform. the weights are in the dual space of the cartan subalgebra. we denote the evaluation of a weight on a coroot vector as a scalar product , . denoting the roots by and the weights of ri by we have fims = x |, | x i x ri nri|, | . for all simple groups with the exception of su with n , this is the full purely cubic sector of the prepotential as there are no non-trivial third casimir invariants. the open dual fundamental weyl chamber is dened as the cone , > , where runs through the set of all simple positive roots. this choice makes it possible to remove the absolute values in the sum over the roots. for a given choice of a group g and representations ri, we then consider the hyperplane arrangement , = , where runs through all the weights of all the representations ri and is an element of the coroot space. if none of these hyperplanes intersect the interior of the dual weyl chamber of g, we can safely remove the absolute values in the sum over the weights. otherwise, we have hyperplanes partitioning the dual fundamental weyl chamber into subchambers. each of these subchambers is dened by the signs of the linear forms , and corresponds to a specic sector of the coulomb branch. two such subchambers are adjacent when they dier by the sign of a unique linear form. within each of these subchambers, the prepotential is a cubic polynomial. but as we go from one subchamber to an adjacent one, we have to go through one of the walls dened by the weights. the transition from one chamber to an adjacent chamber is a phase transition. prepotential and coulomb phases it is immediate to compute the prepotential for a gauge theory with gauge group e coupled to na hypermultiplets tranforming in the adjoint representation and nf hypermultiplets transforming in the fundamental representation first we recall that the open dual fundamental weyl chamber is in our conventions given by the seven inequalities i, for i = , . . . , : ( > , + > , + > , + > , + > , > , > each of the eight chambers of i is uniquely dened by the signs taken by the seven linear functions i, for i = {, , , , , , }. these are classied in table imposing these signs together with the condition of being inside the open dual weyl chamber denes each chamber. we can then compute the prepotential for each chamber: as by their very denition they resolve the absolute values in the denition of f, we end up with polynomials. we illustrate the process for chamber the signs dening chamber are . ( > + > + > + + > + + < < < we can then immediately compute the prepotential f: f = ( + + + ) + nf)( + + ) + ( ) + +   +  + +    nf + nf nf   + + + +  . counting charged hypermultiplets in d using triple intersection numbers we can compute the number of charged hypermultiplets by comparing the triple intersection numbers with fims. we illustrate the process in chamber we can compute the number of multiplets in the adjoint and the fundamental representations by just computing the intersection numbers d and d as the coecients of and depends on linearly on na and nf and are supposed to match the intersection numbers d and d since d is a ruled surface over a curve of genus g and d is the blowup at s v of a ruled surface over a curve of genus g we have d = and d = s v . thus na = g, nf = s v . since the class of a is = k s, and ks = g s, we conclude that na = g, nf =  + s . we can apply the same technique with the same result in the other chambers as the number of multiplets does not change between dierent phases of the coulomb branch. in the next section, we will see that the same numbers na and nf are required to cancel anomalies of a n = six-dimensional theory obtained from a compactication of f-theory on a calabi-yau variety that is a crepant resolution of the weierstrass model of an e-model. application to n = six-dimensional theories local anomalies in six-dimensional theories can be used to constrain the number of charged hyper- multiplets. in the best cases, anomaly conditions can even completely x the matter content of a given six-dimensional theory. this was already brilliantly illustrated by seiberg just after the rst string revolution in a paper in which the absence of anomalies was used to derive the number of matter multiplets in a six-dimensional superconformal eld theory . anomaly cancellations in n = six-dimensional theories here, we consider a supersymmetric gauged supergravity theory. such theories have chiral spinors and chiral tensors and have potential gravitational, gauged, and mixed local anomalies. these local anomalies can be cancelled by the green-schwarz mechanism. f-theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold gives a supersymmetric six-dimensional gauged supergravity for which the green-schwarz mechanism was studied by sadov , see also . in what follows, r represents the riemann curvature of spacetime and tr rn are computed with respect to the fundamental representation of so. we denote by nt, n v , and nh the number of tensor, vector, and hypermultiplets, respectively. the gauge group is g and charged hypermultiplets transform in representations ri of the gauge group. we can distinguish two types of hypermultiplets: those that are neutral and those that transform under some representation ri of the gauge group. in our conventions, hypermultiplets that are charged under a zero weight of the representation are considered neutral. the relevant trace identities for e are tr f = tr f , tr f = , tr f = , where we note that e does not have an independent fourth casimir invariant. the trace identities for a representation ri of a simple group g are trri f a = ari trf f , trri f = bri trf f + cri, with respect to a reference representation f that we can freely choose. we take it to be the funda- mental representation. these group theoretical coecients are listed in . the anomalies are canceled by the green-schwarz mechanism when i factorizes . the modication of the eld strength h of the antisymmetric tensor b is h = db + kl + sa,y , where l and a,y are respectively the gravitational and yang-mills chern-simons terms. if i factors as i = x x, then the anomaly is canceled by adding the following green-schwarz counter-term lgs b x. following sadov , to cancel the local anomalies, we consider x = k tr r + s tr f , where is a constant normalization factor chosen such that the smallest topological charge of an embedded su instanton in the gauge group g is one . this forces to be the dynkin index of the fundamental representation of g as listed in table . if the simple group g is supported on a divisor s, the local anomaly cancellation conditions are the following equations nt = k, nh n v + nt = , badj x i nribri ! = , aadj x i nriari ! = k s, cadj x i nricri ! = s the rst equation gives us the number of tensor multiplets nt . the second equation is the vanishing of the coecient of tr r and will be checked at the end. the third equation is automatically satised since e has no independent quartic casimir . the total number of hypermultiplets is the sum of the neutral hypermultiplets and the charged g an bn cn dn e e e f g table : the normalization factors for each simple gauge algebra. see . hypermultiplets. for a compactication on a calabi-yau threefold y , the number of neutral hyper- multiplets is n h = h, + . the number of each multiplet is n v = dim g, nt = h, = k, nh = n h + nch h = h, + + x i nri  dim ri dim r i  , where the base b is a rational surface with canonical class k. here, nri is the number of hypermultiplets transforming non-trivially in the representation ri of the gauge group, dim r i is the number of zero weights in the representation ri. counting hypermultiplets in d using anomaly cancellation conditions with the gauge group e, we have n v = and h, was computed in for any crepant resolution of a weierstrass model of an e-model: n v = , h, = + k + k s + s for e, the normalization factor is since we have a unique component in the gauge group, the anomaly equations are: = k s, ( n n) = s using the identity g = k s s, where g is the arithmetic genus of the curve s, we nd: n = g, n = , which matches what we found by comparing the triple intersection numbers with the prepotential in the n = ve-dimensional theory obtained by compactiying m-theory on the same elliptic bration. the total number of hypermultiplets is then nh = + + n + n = using equations and , it is a simple arithmetic computation to check that the coecient of tr r vanishes identically : nh n v + nt = remark . as explained in the introduction, the value of n computed in equals one-half of the intersection number sv , which is the number of points over which the ber iiidegenerates to an incomplete ber of type ii. the number is a half-integer when s has odd self-intersection. if s is a rational curve, we see that requesting n to be non-negative forces the self-intersection number s to be greater or equal to a rational curve with self-intersection n is called a n-curve. when s is a -curve, s does not intersect v and there is no matter in the representation when s is a -curve, s intersects v at exactly one point and we get one half-hypermultiplet in the representation acknowledgements m.e. is supported in part by the national

endowed with a rational section and the ber over the generic point of b is a regular projective curve of genus one. denition a. the discriminant locus of an elliptic bration : x b is the locus of points p such that the ber over p is a singular ber. under mild assumptions, the discriminant locus is a divisor in the base. the prime components of the pre-image of prime components of the discriminant locus are called bral divisors. denition a. . a prime weil divisor d is said to be q-cartier when some integral multiple of d is a cartier divisor. a variety y is said to be q-gorenstein if its canonical class is q-cartier. a normal variety y is said to be q-factorial if every prime weil divisor d on x is q-cartier. let f : y x be a projective morphism between normal varieties. a divisor d is said to be f-nef when y d c for any curve c projected to a point by f. denition a. . a minimal model of a projective morphism f : y s between quasi-projective normal varieties is a projective morphism f : y s such that there exists a birational map : y k y such that f = f . given a surjective morphism : x b, a rational section is a rational map : b x such that is the identity away from a zariski closed set of x. y has only q-factorial terminal singularities. ky is f -nef. denition a. resolutions of singularities). a modication of a variety x is a proper birational morphism f : e x x. a resolution of a singularity is a modication f : e x x such that e x is nonsingular. a resolution f : e x x is said to be crepant when x is q-gorenstein and f preserves the canonical class of x (k e x = kx). a strong resolution is a resolution that is an isomorphism away from the singular locus, that is, a resolution f : e x x such that the restriction of f to e x\f ) is an isomorphism onto x\sing. in this paper we only consider strong resolutions and simply call them resolutions. remark a. a crepant resolution of y is automatically a nonsingular minimal model over y . distinct crepant resolutions are connected by a chain of ops if we assume the existence and the termination of ops. kawamata has shown that the seminal results of birkar-cascini-hacon- mckernan together with the boundedness of length of extremal rays imply that dierent minimal models are connected by a sequence of ops. a variety can be q-factorial in the projective category but fail to be q-factorial in the analytic category. an important consequence of the following lemma is that terminal q-factorial singularities are obstructions to the existence of a crepant resolution. lemma a. . let f : y x be a birational morphism between normal varieties. if x is q-factorial, then the exceptional locus of f is of pure codimension one. references p. aluand m. esole. chern class identities from tadpole

"a eective action of the ikkt model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . introduction superstring theory is a promising candidate for a unied theory of all forces in nature. su- perstring theory is only dened perturbatively and has innite degenerate vacua. there- fore, it is said that superstring theory has no predictions for our world, and we need a more fundamental theory. matrix models are proposed as a non-perturbative formulation of superstring theory. in this paper, we focus on ishibashi-kawai-kitazawa-tsuchiya model . this model is derived from the matrix regularization of the green-schwarz action in the schild gauge or large-n reduced model of ten-dimensional super yang-mills theory. in the ikkt model, matter elds and degree of freedom of spacetime are considered to be embedded in matrices. several attempts have been made to show it. in ref. , the authors considered an intersecting at d-branes system based on the ikkt model. to analyze the chirality and the generation structures of the system, they used the analogy of the harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics. they showed the existence of a chiral zero-mode which are coming from a string connecting two dierent d-branes. however, they considered a simple conguration, e.g., two d-branes are orthogonal. therefore, they could not realize multiple chiral zero-modes. in addition, in more general congurations, we cannot easily nd the chiral zero-modes by using the same method because the com- plicated contribution comes from the mixing term between two d-branes. in ref. , the authors considered intersecting fuzzy spheres as compact d-branes and realized two chiral zero-modes. to admit a fuzzy sphere as a classical solution, we must introduce a new term. however, the origin of such a term is not clear. in either case, it is dicult to obtain the number of chiral zero-modes that we expect. in ref. , the authors chal- lenged the realization of three generations by using numerical analysis. by considering the squashed fuzzy sphere in addition to the fuzzy spheres, they succeeded in realizing three generations numerically. on the other hand, the authors of ref. , considered a fuzzy torus with a magnetic ux based on the nite-matrix formulation of gauge theories they computed the index of the overlap dirac operator on the fuzzy torus by the monte carlo simulations and showed the numerical results that are consistent with the index in this paper, we use noncommutative to describe innite dimensional representations or operator algebras and fuzzy to describe nite dimensional representations or approximations. theorem. in this formulation, the exact relationship with the ikkt model is not clear because we must introduce the special type of the dirac operator to obtain the non-trivial index of the dirac operator. moreover, it is still dicult to compute physically important quantities like yukawa couplings. the purposes of this paper are to dene a dirac operator that is consistent with the ikkt model, to analyze the chirality and the generation structures and to compute yukawa couplings of chiral matter elds. to analyze concretely, we consider the noncommutative torus as a classical solution of the ikkt model. it is known that the nc torus as an irrational rotation ring can be realized in the ikkt model . in addition, we consider the analogy of the toroidal compactications of d sym theory. in ref. , the authors considered the toroidal compactications of d sym theory with magnetic uxes. a key concept is the twisted bundle. the twisted bundle can be interpreted as a compatibility condition between the periodic boundary conditions on the torus and the gauge transformations. this compatibility condition implies that the magnetic uxes are quantized, then the zero-mode solution of the dirac equation can have the chirality and the degeneracies. the authors of ref. identied these results as the chirality and the generation structures in the four-dimensional eective theory and computed the yukawa couplings by computing the overlap integral over the torus. from the viewpoint of phenomenology in superstring theory, this result is very important. therefore, we consider the twisted bundle on the nc torus. in the following, we propose a dirac operator on the nc torus that is consistent with the ikkt model, and we solve the zero-mode equation of this dirac operator with magnetic uxes. then, we compute the normalization factors of the zero-mode solutions and yukawa couplings of chiral matter elds. the organization of this paper is as follows. in section , we briey review the ikkt model and the realization of the nc torus in the ikkt model. in section , we review the basic results of the toroidal compactications of d sym theory. in section , we introduce dierential operators on the nc torus based on noncommutative geometry. in addition, we propose a dirac operator that is consistent with the ikkt model. in section , we solve the zero-mode equation by using the analogy of the fourier transformation. in addition, we compute the normalization factors of the zero-mode solutions and the yukawa couplings of chiral matter elds. to compute, we dene the trace that is consistent with the gauge transformations and the torus translations. section contains conclusions and discussion. ikkt model ishibashi-kawai-kitazawa-tsuchiya model the action of the ikkt model is dened as follows , s = gtr  + m  , where xm is a d vector and n n hermitian matrix, is a d majorana-weyl spinor whose components are n n matrices and g is a scale factor. indices are contracted by the minkowski metric. on the other hand, we will see that this action admits an innite dimensional representation like linear operators in the next subsection. the action has some symmetries: xm = i m, = i mn, xm = , = n, t xm = cmn, t = , gxm = i, g = i, where i is d majorana-weyl spinor as a grassmann odd parameter, cm is a d constant vector, n is the n n identity matrix, and is a n n hermitian matrix. eqs. and can be identied n = supersymmetry as follows. if we consider a linear combination of and as + , i ), then we can obtain [ , ]xm = i mij, [ , ] = , where we used eq. and the equation of motion of . if we identify xm as a d spacetime coordinate, eq. is n = on-shell susy algebra. in this sense, we often say that the degree of freedom of spacetime is embedded in matrices. from this, there is a possibility of analysis for the dynamics of spacetime, e.g., a mechanism of compacti- cations. when = , the equation of motion of xm is ] = the simplest solution is = however, we can show that attractive forces act between the eigenvalues in the one-loop eective potential around this vacuum. therefore, they do not spread, and the correspondence with the original theory does not hold. in this case, we need more conditions on gauge groups . the second simplest, however, an interesting solution is that some commutators are proportional to the identity matrix, i.e., = imn, where mn is a real anti-symmetric matrix with respect to the lorentz indices. we omit the identity matrix. when each matrix has a nite size, eq. is a contradiction. we should interpret eq. as it is satised at large matrix size. this is the correspondence between a function algebra and a matrix algebra in the matrix regularization. on the other hand, the innite dimensional representation, which we are interested, strictly respects eq. . we can also interpret eq. as a d-branes conguration as follows. we can nd that the transformation by is proportional to the identity matrix and cancel the transformation by . explicitly, if we set = mnmn, then )xm = , ) = therefore, the half of n = susy is preserved in this background, and the one-loop eective potential exactly vanishes due to susy. it is an advantage of this model that a many-body system of d-branes can be realized. when we consider two sets of eq. , [xm , xn ] = imn , [xm , xn ] = imn , then xm = xm xm  is also a solution of eq. . in general, eq. is not a d-branes conguration. however, some congurations become a d-branes conguration again, e.g., the case of xm = xm is interpreted as two coincident d-branes, and other cases are considered in ref. . nc torus in the ikkt model in this subsection, we briey review the nc torus in the ikkt model based on refs. . a unitary transformation is dened by xm uxmu, uu, where u is a unitary matrix . if the trace in the action has the cyclic property, this unitary transformation becomes a symmetry of the ikkt model. the innitesimal form of eq. corresponds to eq. . the authors of ref. showed that the nc torus can be realized by this unitary transformation. we restrict the action to the subspace of belonging to the same gauge class before and after translations in the directions x and x in other word, we consider conditions as follows, uxu = x + r, uxu = x + r, uixmu i = xm , uiu i = , where ri is the scalar matrix of a real coecient corresponding to the periods of the torus. in the following, let us dene m = , = and i = we can see that any nite dimensional representations do not satisfy the conditions . however, we can nd solutions if we interpret xm and as operators on an innite dimensional hilbert space from eq. , we can conrm that uuu u commutes with xm and . there- fore, we assume (or we may be able to apply schurs lemma for countable dimensional cases because we can also realize u and u as operators on l) that uuu u is a scalar operator, i.e., uu = eiuu, where is a real parameter. eq. is the algebra of the nc torus in mathematics. pre- cisely, we can restrict because of some isomorphisms. depending on whether the parameter is a rational number or an irrational number, the mathematical structure diers. in fact, the algebra of the nc torus admits a nite dimensional representation if q, and we cannot realize such algebra by the nite dimensional representation if r\q. in this paper, we assume r\q because we are interested in the innite dimensional representation of the nc torus. in this sense, xm, , u and u are no longer nite dimensional matrices but operators. we use hat to indicate that it is an operator . in the following, we show a concrete representation of xm, u and u let us start from a hilbert space h = l cm, m n (m corresponds to zm in the usual construction ). we can realize u and u as operators on h, i.e., u |x : j= x n m + : j e , u |x : j= exp  i  x nj m  |x : j, where n is some integer. for simplicity, we assume that m and n are positive and co-prime each other . we dene x and x as in general, the trace on an innite dimensional hilbert space does not satisfy the cyclic property (e.g., the position operators, the momentum operators and their commutation relations in quantum mechanics). we will dene the trace which is consistent with the gauge transformations and the conditions . x := m n mr x m, x := r p m, where m is the m m identity matrix, x and p are the position operator and the mo- mentum operator on one-dimensional quantum mechanics , respectively. we can see that = m nmrr and easily conrm that eqs. and are satised. in the following, since the part acting on cm is the identity matrix, we use the hilbert space spanned by {|x; x |x= x |x} or {|x; x |x= x |x}. from an analogy of quantum mechanics, x x = a exp  ixx  , a = rr , since the periodicity is realized by the unitary operators u and u, and we restrict the fundamental region to x r and x r toroidal compactications of d sym theory in this section, we review the basic results of toroidal compactications of d sym theory based on refs. . twisted bundle on the torus let us start from u gauge theory on the torus t in this paper, we take a lattice z that is generated by v = and v = , and t is dened by r/. a constant magnetic ux is introduced by a = , a = fx, then the magnetic ux f = f. we use the same gauge choice in section let hm be a hilbert space such that the spectrum of the hermitian operator x lies in the interval mr x r in this case, hm is unitary equivalent to hnz therefore, we interpret the fundamental region with respect to the x-direction is x r we interpret the x-direction as well. we must conrm that the gauge theory is well-dened on t obviously, we should conrm only about x-direction. the covariant derivatives transform like d d, d d irf. if this translation can be absorbed as the gauge symmetry, u gauge theory on t is well-dened. actually, we can realize eq. by d = d, d = d irf, where = exp. in general, we need to consider another gauge trans- formation associated with the translation along the x-direction. in the above case, = the above concept is called the twisted bundle. in addition, we must conrm a consistency condition = eq. implies a f z, where a = rr is the area of the torus. namely, the magnetic ux on the torus is quantized. zero-modes of dirac operator on t we can analytically solve the zero-mode equations of the dirac operator with the back- ground gauge eld . the dirac operator is dened by / d = x i=, idi =  i fx + i + fx  , where and are the pauli matrices and , respectively. for convenience, we rewrite the constant magnetic ux as f = a n, where n is a positive integer and = sign. the zero-mode equation of the dirac operator is / d = if is labeled by the eigenvalue of the chirality matrix , i.e., =  +  , the zero-mode equations of each component can be written as s = . we can easily factorize s satisfying eq. as s = exp  sf  f s, where f s satises f s = exp  n r s  f s, f s  x + is  = f s. f s is periodic with respect to the x-direction. therefore, we can use the fourier expansion as f s = x nz cs n exp ns r  . from the rst condition of eq. , the fourier coecients satisfy cs n = exp sr r  cs nn. if we decompose n into n = np + q , thus we can rewrite eq. as cs np+q = exp  r r s  cs q. from the above, f s can be written as f s = n x q= cs q x pz exp  r r s  exp  s r  . if s = +, f s converges. in other words, the sign of the magnetic ux deter- mines the chirality of the zero-mode solution. in addition, the summation with respect to q means that there are n-independent zero-mode solutions. in ref. , these results are interpreted as the chirality and the generation structures in the four-dimensional eective theory. therefore, each degenerated solution of eq. is s q = cs q exp  |f|  x pz exp  r r s  exp  s r  . each cs q is determined by the normalization condition, i.e., z r dx z r dxs, q s q = qq. from eq. , |cs q| r exp

 = x pz exp  i + i  , where im > we can easily generalize the above discussion to non-abelian, bi-fundamental or higher dimensional torus. dirac operator on the nc torus and the ikkt model in this section, we introduce dierential operators on the nc torus and construct them from the ikkt model. dierential operators on the nc torus let a be a c-algebra over c and d : a a be a linear map. d is called a derivation on a if d satises the leibniz rule, i.e., d = b + a, d = , for all a, b a, c. in mathematics, the nc torus is the c-algebra generated by u and u satisfying eq. . therefore, derivations are completely dened by how they act on the two generators. we dene u = i r u, u = i r u, u = u = and satisfy the linearity and the leibniz rule. i is called the basic derivation. the factors r and r come from the denition of the torus, c.f., subsection . we can conrm that the basic derivations commute each other. the dirac operator on the nc torus is dened by the basic derivations / d := i x i=, ii, where and are the pauli matrices and , respectively. dirac operator on the nc torus based on the ikkt model in this subsection, we construct the dierential operators, which are introduced in the previous subsection, based on the ikkt model. first, we focus on noncommutative sym theory based on the ikkt model . we consider the expansion of the action around the specic background: spacetime xm bg satisfying eq. , gauge eld abg,m will be dened in section namely, xm = xm bg + mn( abg,n + an). we refer to appendix a for the details. a point is that the partial derivatives are dened as m := imn h xn bg, i , where mn is the inverse matrix of mn. we can conrm that the partial derivatives satisfy m xn bg = n m. here, we assume that mn is non-degenerate. in the following, we identify xm bg with eq. ), and we omit the subscription bg. the action of i on the algebra of the nc torus is i uj = iik h xk, uj i = ij irj uj. therefore, the basic derivations on the nc torus based on the ikkt model are dened as i := ijj. we can conrm that the basic derivations satisfy eq. . in addition, eq. and the jacobi identity assures the commutativity of the basic derivations . from the above, we propose a dirac operator on the nc torus that is consistent with the ikkt model as follows, / dphys := i x i=, ii. in the fermionic part of the action , / d = x i= i h xi, i is identied as a dirac operator on the extra dimensions, e.g., . as mentioned above, we focus on the rst two extra dimensions that are the nc torus (i.e., p i= p i=,). we can verify that eqs. and are equivalent. namely, / dphys = i x i=, ii = iiij  ijk h xk, i = i h xi, i = / d . therefore, the operator is a suitable dirac operator on the nc torus based on the ikkt model. the partial derivatives are dened by eq. , and the gauge eld is introduced by eq. . the covariant derivatives are naturally dened by m dm := imn h xn bg + nl al, i = m i h am, i . however, we cannot introduce any fermions in a fundamental representation, i.e., , where is a unitary operator as a gauge transformation. this comes from eq. . the subscription phys means that the dirac operator has the mass dimension this mass dimension is the same with the usual dirac operator in qft. on the other hand, we can introduce fermions in a fundamental representation if we dene the covariant derivatives as dm := m i am. however, the original action does not have the eld strength which is dened by the covariant derivatives . therefore, if we want to consider fermions in a fundamental representation, we should realize as a part of the action . let us consider, for example, u gauge theory with an adjoint matter based on the action , i.e., xm u := xm u , am =  a m a m a m a m  , =   , where xm satises h xm , xn i = imn. we assume that the gauge group breaks such that u u u u: top left component of ai. if we focus on only and ignore other components of ai, then we can derive the action with the fermion in u fundamental representation. zero-mode analysis on the magnetized nc torus twisted bundle on the nc torus to consider the twisted bundle on the nc torus, we introduce a background gauge eld a( x, x) = , a( x, x) = f x, and the eld strength is f = f. the gauge transformation is obtained by am a m = am + i m , where is a unitary operator. the background gauge eld is varied by the torus translations , i.e., a( x + r, x) = a( x, x + r) = , a( x + r, x) = a( x, x) + rf, a( x, x + r) = a( x, x). we can realize eq. as the gauge transformations, i.e., ( x, x) exp  ir + f f x  , ( x, x) , where represents an action on cm part. this part does not aect eq. since the cm part of x and x is the identity matrix. therefore, in the following, we assume this part is the identity matrix and omit. next, we must consider the consistency condition corresponding to eq. . namely, ( x + r, x) ( x, x) = ( x, x + r) ( x, x). eq. implies that the magnetic ux f is quantized such that f + f a = n z. zero-modes of the dirac operator / dphys in this subsection, we consider the zero-mode equations of the dirac operator / dphys with the background gauge eld . in the following, we show the zero-mode solutions in fundamental representation bifundamental representation. case in this case, the zero-mode equation is / dphys =  ( i f x) + i + f x   +  = , where s is in the fundamental representation. simply, ( + is + sf x) s = with the periodic boundary conditions s( x + r, x) = exp  ir + f f x  s( x, x) s( x, x + r) = s( x, x) although eq. is written by the operators, this equation has the same form with eq. . therefore, we expect that the zero-mode equation can be constructed from that of eq. . here, we consider the fourier transformations. the fourier transformation of the whole zero-mode solution of eq. is obtained by s = z dk x n=|n|p+qz c exp  k |f| ikn rf  exp  ikx exp  i n r x  , where c is the normalization constant and the magnetic ux f satises the quantization condition . we expect that the whole solution of eq. is obtained by s( x, x) = z dk x n=|n|p+qz c exp  k |f| ikn rf  exp h ik xi exp  i n r x  . however, eq. does not satisfy eq. because the quantization conditions for the magnetic ux are dierent. here, we focus on that p and q do not appear alone in eq. . this fact allows us to vary the decomposition of the label from n = |n|p + q to n = |n |p + q. in addition, we should replace the magnetic ux f with f satisfying . then, we can obtain the zero-mode solutions, i.e., s( x, x) = z dk x n=|n |p+qz c exp  k |f| ikn rf  exp h ik xi exp  i n r x  , we can obtain the same result by using the baker-campbell-hausdorformula. or s q( x, x) = z dk x pz c exp  k |f| ik rf  exp h ik xi exp  i|n |p + q r x  , where q = |n | we can conrm that the above expansions satisfy eq. if fs > the normalization constant c will be computed in subsection . however, this form is dicult to use when we compute the normalization constant and yukawa couplings. fortunately, we can rewrite by using the jacobi theta-function s q( x, x) = c r |f| exp  |f| ( x)   q/n   s|n | ir ( x + is x), ir r sn  . if we require sn > , eq. can be interpreted as the operator form of eq. up to the normalization constant. therefore, in the following, we restrict ourselves to the case sn > case for simplicity, we consider the magnetic ux breaks the gauge group u uu, i.e., a( x, x) = , a( x, x) = f x f x  , where fi satises . in this case, we consider a fermion in u adjoint representation, =  +  , s =  s s s s  . the zero-mode equation for each chirality is written as  s s s s  + s  f[ x, s ] f x s f s x f x s f s x f[ x, s ]  = . first, we consider the top right component s precisely, the zero-mode equation of s is s + s(f x s f s x) = with the periodic boundary conditions s ( x + r, x) = exp  ir + f f x  s ( x, x) exp  ir + f f x  s ( x, x + r) = s ( x, x) in the case , exp h |f| ( x)i of eq. corresponds to the term: sf x in eq. . from this observation, we can obtain the solutions of eq. as s ( x, x) = z dk x n=|n|p+qz c exp  k |f| ikn rf  exp h ik xi exp  i n r x  , or s ,q( x, x) = c r |f| exp  sf ( x)   q/|n|  s|n| ir ( x + is x), ir r |n|  exp sf ( x)  where f = ff, s = sign, n = nn, and we restrict ourselves to sn we can conrm that eq. satises eq. and the periodic boundary conditions if sf > next, we consider the top left component s the zero-mode equation of s is written as s + sf[ x, s ] = with the periodic boundary conditions s ( x + r, x) = exp  ir + f f x  s ( x, x) exp  ir + f f x  , s ( x, x + r) = s ( x, x). in this case, the right-hand side of the rst condition of corresponds to the shift of x such that x x+ n r . this shift implies f +f = , and this is a contradiction. therefore, s must be the scalar operator, i.e., s = const. obviously, the above results can be generalized to the magnetic uxes break the gauge group u qn a= u, where pn a= na = n. eigenvalues of the laplacian in the ikkt model, := p i[ xi, [ xi, ]] (in this paper, := p i=,[ xi, [ xi, ]]) is identi- ed as the laplacian ). the eigenvalue problem of the laplacian relates to that of the square of the dirac operator. let us rewrite the dirac operator as / dphys =  d d  , then / d phys =  dd dd  = + ! . the action of on component of the fermion is written as / d phys s = s sf s from the above, d has the zero-mode solutions if f > . therefore, we can see that eq. is not only the zero-modes of the dirac operator but also the lightest mode of the laplacian. in addition, we can construct the eigenmodes of the laplacian corresponding component. we focus on the commutation relation of d and d, s = f s if we select f > , d and d can play roles of the creation operator and the annihilation operator, respectively. by considering the analogy of the harmonic oscillator, i.e., n := dd, = n + f, then the eigenmodes of the laplacian are obtained by +,n = n +,n , +,n := dn + , n = f if we select f < , it is sucient to reverse the roles of d and d. in the commutative case, the spectrum of the laplacian is obtained by n = f(n+ ), where fi is the magnetic ux satisfying and f = f f it seems that the spectrum vanishes in the limit however, the bosonic part of the eective action is the fourth order for the nc parameter if we ignore the order included in the denition of the partial derivatives. therefore, of the spectrum is necessary, but the limit is non-trivial. normalizations and yukawa couplings normalizations let us start from the normalization constant of eq. since f = corresponds to the case . = tr  s, ,q( x, x) s ,q( x, x)  := z r dx x s, ,q( x, x) s ,q( x, x) x = a z r dx z r dx s, ,q s ,q = qq|c|r|f| a i, where we use commutative in the sense of usual

should note the denition of the trace on the innite dimensional space. for example, z r dx x f( x, x) x = z r dx z r dx x f( x, x) x x x = z r dx z r dx x x x f( x, x) x = z r dx x f( x, x) x = tr  f( x, x)  . in addition, we should conrm that the trace is well-dened with respect to the compact- ication conditions . in this paper, target operators f are periodic with respect to the x-direction. this means z r r dx x f( x, x) x = z r dx x + r f( x, x) x + r = z r dx x u f( x, x) u x = z r dx x f( x, x + r) x = z r dx x f( x, x) x = tr  f( x, x)  . on the other hand, the target operators f are quasiperiodic with respect to the x- direction. since the unitary operator for the quasiperiodicity is written by x ( is also periodic with respect to the x-direction), then z r r dx x f( x, x) x = z r dx x + r f( x, x) x + r = z r dx x u f( x, x) u x = z r dx x f( x, x) x = z r dx x f( x, x) x = tr  f( x, x)  , where we used the equivalence in the fourth line. for general gauge transformations u, we can show the equivalence between before and after the gauge transformations if we assume the existence of the completeness relation of u. therefore, the cyclic property of the trace is held, at least, for the gauge transfor- mations. therefore, the gauge symmetry of the action is still held. similarly, we can verify that all traces dened by the appropriate completeness relation are equivalent. yukawa couplings in the following, for simplicity, we consider the magnetic uxes break the gauge group u q a= u, where p a= na = n to compute the yukawa couplings. the background gauge eld is obtained by a( x, x) = , a( x, x) = f xn f xn f xn , where fi satises and ni is the ni ni identity matrix. we should consider a sign assignment of the magnetic uxes. in the following, we select f, f, f > . this sign assignment is justied by the relation f + f + f = the component of the zero-mode fermions corresponding the above sign assignment is obtained by =  +  , + = const. + ,i + ,j const. + ,k const. , = +,, where i, j and k denote the degeneracies and const. = (corresponds to the wavefunctions of the gauginos in the commutative case). the lightest mode bosons have the same matrix structure with the chiral zero-mode fermions. let us denote by ab,i the block component of the zero-mode fermions or the lightest mode bosons since their function form is the same. in the action , the yukawa couplings are described as the product of three matrices, i.e., yijk := tr  ,k ,i ,j  . first, we focus on the product ,i ,j. if operators commute each other, these operators can be regarded as c-numbers. this allows us to use convenient formulas. from eq. , this product can be written by i ,j = s |ff| |f| cc c x mz|n|+|n| ,i+j+|n|m |n|i|n|j+|n||n|m |nnn| !  , ir r |nnn|  , where we used s, s = + and the product formula of the jacobi theta-function  r n   r n  = x mzn+n r+r+nm n+n  )  nrnr+nnm nn  ). on the other hand, the orthogonality of ab,i is assured in the above result. therefore, the yukawa couplings is obtained by yijk = r a r i ii |n|  k |n| j |n|  !  , ir r |nnn|  , where we assume m z|n|+|n| such that k = i + j + |n|m. the yukawa couplings dier from the commutative case by the overall factor only if we x the generation numbers n, n and n on the other hand, we can conrm that the yukawa couplings go back to the commutative case in the limit since the normalization constant goes back to the commutative case however, the limit is non-trivial since the nc parameter remains in the yukawa couplings, c.f., i := ijj in eq. . conclusions and discussions in this paper, we performed the analysis of the chirality and the generation structures on the magnetized nc torus based on the ikkt model. in subsection , we proposed the suitable dirac operator on the nc torus by considering noncommutative geometry. in section , we analyzed the zero-mode solutions of the dirac operator we proposed. we showed that zero-mode solutions have the chirality and the generations structures. in addition, we computed the yukawa couplings of chiral matter elds. compared with the commutative case, the dierence of the yukawa couplings is the overall factor only. advantages of our method are we can consider geometric conditions such as periodic boundary conditions we can write down the analytic form of zero-mode solutions which can easily be compared with the commutative case. this is important to observe nc eects from the ikkt model. when we consider the microscopic world, we compute the physical quantities through functions on spacetime like wavefunctions. on the other hand, in noncommutative ge- ometry, we consider a function algebra on a certain space which has a nc product. for example, the star-product is a nc product in the context of deformation quantization. in the relationship between analytical mechanics and quantum mechanics, this corresponds to the replacement of the coordinate of the phase space by operators. therefore, in the sense of noncommutative geometry, we can admit that the chirality and the generation structures of our zero-mode solutions have the physical meanings even though zero-mode solutions are written by the operators. from a phenomenological point of view, our results may not be new because the the normalization constants are slightly dierent between the commutative case and our case. this is because the integral of is normalized to obtain the area of the torus in the commutative case. in our case, the integral of is normalized by considering the analogy of quantum mechanics . this normalization is natural from the viewpoint of the nc torus without magnetic uxes. therefore, if we consider the integral of is normalized to obtain in the commutative case, the normalization constants are the same between the commutative case and our case. dierence of the yukawa couplings is the overall factor only. however, the important point of this paper is that the ikkt model can describe the string-motivated model including the nc eect. the ikkt model is considered as a non-perturbative formulation of superstring theory. therefore, we expect that the ikkt model should describe the results of string-motivated models known so far. from this point of view, our results are important. we are interested in generalizations: orbifolds, complex structure + wilson line and the origin of the magnetic ux. the toroidal orbifolds are typical models in string phenomenology. in magnetized toroidal orbifolds, the generation structure diers from the toroidal compactications without orbifold projections. in refs. , the nc toroidal orbifolds are considered. on the other hand, in general, the yukawa couplings in the toroidal compactications are functions of the complex structure moduli and the wilson lines. therefore, the values of the complex structure moduli and the wilson lines are important to compare with the observed values . our results correspond to the case whose complex structure is = ir/r we can consider the complexication when we introduce the basic derivations. we expect that the yukawa couplings on the magnetized nc torus are obtained by the general complex structure instead of = ir/r and the overall factor including . in our results, the magnetic ux played an important role. however, we introduced the magnetic ux by hand. we expect that the magnetic ux is also generated from the dynamics of the ikkt model. recently, in refs. , the authors showed that the magnetic ux may come from the tachyon condensations induced from the dynamics of d-branes and non-bps d-branes. we expect that our results can be described by the full dynamics of the ikkt model. gauge selection in this paper, we selected the axial gauge . our method, especially the ansatz of the zero-mode solutions which are similar to the fourier transformation, depends on the gauge selection. therefore, we should conrm the gauge invariance of our results. in the commutative case, the background gauge eld with the xed magnetic ux f is obtained by a = tfx, a = fx, where t . we can realize the gauge transformation from t to t by u = exp . on the other hand, the background gauge eld on the nc torus with the xed magnetic ux f is obtained by a = tf x, a = f x, where t . we expect that the gauge transformation from t to t by the unitary operator, at least, u = exp h i( x x + x x) i , where r. however, we can nd a condition such that f) = f) for all r. if we x the starting point t = t, then t must be t or t since eq. is a quadratic equation with respect to the t we need to conrm whether the gauge transformations from t to t exist. this situation is the same with a gauge theory on a nc space with the star-product formulation. this is an open question. if we cannot nd, dierent gauge backgrounds may correspond to physically dierent theories. the limit: the zero-mode solutions and become those of the commutative case if we con- sider the limit and assume the operators ( x, x) correspond to the coordinate on the torus . in addition, the yukawa couplings are the same with the com- mutative case in this limit. however, from the discussion in ref. , the nc parameter remains in the eective action, e.g., the eective metric. therefore, in terms of the eective action, the limit is non-trivial. this is also an open question for us. acknowledgments the

techniques. in this appendix, we consider the whole spacetime again. the action of the ikkt model is s = gtr  [ xm, xn][ xm, xn] + m[ xm, ]  , where m, n = first, we consider the bosonic part of the action , i.e., sb = gtr  [ xm, xn][ xm, xn]  we introduced the gauge eld as a uctuation . by substituting, sb = gtr  ikjl[ xi bg + im am, xj bg + jm am][ xk bg + kn an, xl bg + ln an]  . for concreteness, we consider the u gauge group. i j = aiaj and ij = aibj can be selected as the basis of the lie algebra. accordingly, the trace of the action is dened on the operator space and the gauge group. then, we can expand the gauge eld and the fermions in the adjoint representation as am = bm + wm = ba mua + w ab m eab, = + = aua + abeab. let us dene m = imn[ xn bg, ] , fmn = m bn n bm i[ bm, bn] gauge group), dm wn = m wn i[ bm, wn] gauge group), gmn = minjij , then eq. is rewritten as sb = gtr  fmn mn   f mn mn [ wm, wn][ w m, w n]  + gtr  dm wndm w n dm wndn w m i( fmn mn)[ w m, w n])  , where the indices are contracted by the eective metric, and we used the cyclic property of the trace. next, we introduce the abelian magnetic ux on the extra-dimensional space , i.e., ba i =< ba i > + ca i , w ab i = ab i , where ca i and ab i are uctuations around the abelian magnetic ux background (we set < w ab i >= ). by substituting the background , eq. is rewritten as sb = gtr  idd i + j di di j i g  < f a ij > < f b ij >  i,ab j,ba + sb,other, where di ab j := i ab j i < ba i > ab j + i ab j < bb i >, and we used the cyclic property of the trace. sb,other contains irrelevant terms for our main discussions. in eq. , we can see the laplacian on the extra-dimensional space, i.e., d := gij di dj = x i [ xi, [ xi, ]]. similarly, we can obtain the fermionic part of the eective action sf = gtr  i d + i i di + i[ i, ]  + sf,other, where the indices are contracted by the minkowski metric and := , and sf,other contains irrelevant terms for our main discussions.

Ishibashi-Kawai-Kitazawa-Tsuchiya (IKKT) model, explores the dynamics of spacetime and compactifications using matrix models. Multiple attempts have been made to analyze the chiral and generation structures within this model, including the realization of chiral zero-modes and numerical analyses to achieve three generations. By introducing a Dirac operator consistent with the IKKT model, the study computes Yukawa couplings of chiral matter fields on a noncommutative torus. The analysis involves the twisted bundle on the torus, the zero-mode solutions of the Dirac operator, and normalization factors. Results show that the IKKT model can incorporate string-motivated models with noncommutative effects, emphasizing the importance of understanding and integrating the dynamics of magnetic fluxes within the model. Various extensions to include complex structures, Wilson lines, and orbifolds are mentioned for future research. The paper also touches on gauge selections, the approach taken depends on the axial gauge, and the study concludes by acknowledging open questions and potential future directions for research."
