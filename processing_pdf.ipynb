              "      <td>transformers were proposed by vaswani et al. () for machine translation, and have since be- come the state of the art method in many nlp tasks. large transformer based models are often pre trained on large corpora and then ne tuned for the task at hand: bert (devlin et al., ) uses a denoising self supervised pre training task, while the gpt line of work uses language mod- eling as its pre training task (radford et al., ; ; brown et al., ). naive application of self attention to images would require that each pixel attends to every other pixel. with quadratic cost in the number of pixels, this does not scale to realistic input sizes. thus, to apply transformers in the context of image processing, several approximations have been tried in the past. parmar et al. () applied the self attention only in local neighborhoods for each query pixel instead of globally. such local multi head dot product self attention blocks can completely replace convolutions (hu et al., ; ramachandran et al., ; zhao et al., ). in a different line of work, sparse transformers (child et al., ) employ scalable approximations to global self- attention in order to be applicable to images. an alternative way to scale attention is to apply it in blocks of varying sizes (weissenborn et al., ), in the extreme case only along individual axes (ho et al., ; wang et al., a). many of these specialized attention architectures demonstrate promising results on computer vision tasks, but require complex engineering to be implemented efciently on hardware accelerators. most related to ours is the model of cordonnier et al. (), which extracts patches of size from the input image and applies full self attention on top. this model is very similar to vit, but our work goes further to demonstrate that large scale pre training makes vanilla transformers competitive with (or even better than) state of the art cnns. moreover, cordonnier et al.

              "      <td>we have explored the direct application of transformers to image recognition. unlike prior works using self attention in computer vision, we do not introduce image specic inductive biases into the architecture apart from the initial patch extraction step. instead, we interpret an image as a sequence of patches and process it by a standard transformer encoder as used in nlp. this simple, yet scalable, strategy works surprisingly well when coupled with pre training on large datasets. thus, vision transformer matches or exceeds the state of the art on many image classication datasets, whilst being relatively cheap to pre train. while these initial results are encouraging, many challenges remain. one is to apply vit to other computer vision tasks, such as detection and segmentation. our results, coupled with those in carion et al. (), indicate the promise of this approach. another challenge is to continue exploring self- supervised pre training methods. our initial experiments show improvement from self supervised pre training, but there is still large gap between self supervised and large scale supervised pre- training. finally, further scaling of vit would likely lead to improved performance. acknowledgements the work was performed in berlin, z urich, and amsterdam. we thank many colleagues at google for their help, in particular andreas steiner for crucial help with the infrastructure and the open- source release of the code; joan puigcerver and maxim neumann for help with the large scale training infrastructure; dmitry lepikhin, aravindh mahendran, daniel keysers, mario lu ci c, noam shazeer, ashish vaswani, and colin raffel for useful discussions. references samira abnar and willem zuidema. quantifying attention ow in transformers. in acl, philip bachman, r devon hjelm, and william buchwalter. learning representations by maximizing mutual information across views. in neurips, published as a conference paper at iclr alexei baevski and michael auli. adaptive inpu...</td>\n",

(b) proposed the axialresnet model in which all the convolutions with kernel size in a resnet are replaced by axial self attention, i.e. a row and column attention, augmented by relative positional encoding. we have implemented axialresnet as a baseline model. moreover, we have modied vit to process inputs in the -dimensional shape, instead of a - dimensional sequence of patches, and incorporate axial transformer blocks, in which instead of a self attention followed by an mlp, we have a a row self attention plus an mlp followed by a column self attention plus an mlp. figure , present the performance of axial resnet, axial vit b/ and axial vit b/ on ima- genet shot linear, when pretrained on jft dataset, verses the pretraining compute, both in terms of number of flops and inference time (example per seconds). as we can see, both axial vit b/ and axial vit b/ do better than their vit b counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at our implementation is based on the open sourced pytorch implementation in https://github.com/ csrhddlam/axial deeplab. in our experiments, we reproduced the scores reported in (wang et al., b) in terms of accuracy, however, our implementation, similar to the open source implementation, is very slow on tpus. therefore, we were not able to use it for extensive large scale experiments. these may be unlocked by a carefully optimized implementation. published as a conference paper at iclr total compute...</td>\n",

              "1   self attention based architectures, in particular transformers (vaswani et al., ), have become the model of choice in natural language processing (nlp). the dominant approach is to pre train on a large text corpus and then ne tune on a smaller task specic dataset (devlin et al., ). thanks to transformers computational efciency and scalability, it has become possible to train models of unprecedented size, with over b parameters (brown et al., ; lepikhin et al., ). with the models and datasets growing, there is still no sign of saturating performance. in computer vision, however, convolutional architectures remain dominant (lecun et al., ; krizhevsky et al., ; he et al., ). inspired by nlp successes, multiple works try combining cnn like architectures with self attention (wang et al., ; carion et al., ), some replacing the convolutions entirely (ramachandran et al., ; wang et al., a). the latter models, while theoretically efcient, have not yet been scaled effectively on modern hardware accelerators due to the use of specialized attention patterns. therefore, in large scale image recognition, classic resnet- like architectures are still state of the art (mahajan et al., ; xie et al., ; kolesnikov et al., ). inspired by the transformer scaling successes in nlp, we experiment with applying a standard transformer directly to images, with the fewest possible modications. to do so, we split an image into patches and provide the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to a trans- former. image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an nlp application. we train the model on image classication in supervised fashion. when trained on mid sized datasets such as imagenet without strong regularization, these mod- els yield modest accuracies of a few percentage points below resnets of comparable size. this seemingly discouraging outcome may be expected: transformers lack some of the inductive biases fine tuning code and pre trained models are a...   \n",
              "2   transformers were proposed by vaswani et al. () for machine translation, and have since be- come the state of the art method in many nlp tasks. large transformer based models are often pre trained on large corpora and then ne tuned for the task at hand: bert (devlin et al., ) uses a denoising self supervised pre training task, while the gpt line of work uses language mod- eling as its pre training task (radford et al., ; ; brown et al., ). naive application of self attention to images would require that each pixel attends to every other pixel. with quadratic cost in the number of pixels, this does not scale to realistic input sizes. thus, to apply transformers in the context of image processing, several approximations have been tried in the past. parmar et al. () applied the self attention only in local neighborhoods for each query pixel instead of globally. such local multi head dot product self attention blocks can completely replace convolutions (hu et al., ; ramachandran et al., ; zhao et al., ). in a different line of work, sparse transformers (child et al., ) employ scalable approximations to global self- attention in order to be applicable to images. an alternative way to scale attention is to apply it in blocks of varying sizes (weissenborn et al., ), in the extreme case only along individual axes (ho et al., ; wang et al., a). many of these specialized attention architectures demonstrate promising results on computer vision tasks, but require complex engineering to be implemented efciently on hardware accelerators. most related to ours is the model of cordonnier et al. (), which extracts patches of size from the input image and applies full self attention on top. this model is very similar to vit, but our work goes further to demonstrate that large scale pre training makes vanilla transformers competitive with (or even better than) state of the art cnns. moreover, cordonnier et al. () use a small patch size of pixels, which makes the model applicable on...   \n",

              "12  we have explored the direct application of transformers to image recognition. unlike prior works using self attention in computer vision, we do not introduce image specic inductive biases into the architecture apart from the initial patch extraction step. instead, we interpret an image as a sequence of patches and process it by a standard transformer encoder as used in nlp. this simple, yet scalable, strategy works surprisingly well when coupled with pre training on large datasets. thus, vision transformer matches or exceeds the state of the art on many image classication datasets, whilst being relatively cheap to pre train. while these initial results are encouraging, many challenges remain. one is to apply vit to other computer vision tasks, such as detection and segmentation. our results, coupled with those in carion et al. (), indicate the promise of this approach. another challenge is to continue exploring self- supervised pre training methods. our initial experiments show improvement from self supervised pre training, but there is still large gap between self supervised and large scale supervised pre- training. finally, further scaling of vit would likely lead to improved performance. acknowledgements the work was performed in berlin, z urich, and amsterdam. we thank many colleagues at google for their help, in particular andreas steiner for crucial help with the infrastructure and the open- source release of the code; joan puigcerver and maxim neumann for help with the large scale training infrastructure; dmitry lepikhin, aravindh mahendran, daniel keysers, mario lu ci c, noam shazeer, ashish vaswani, and colin raffel for useful discussions. references samira abnar and willem zuidema. quantifying attention ow in transformers. in acl, philip bachman, r devon hjelm, and william buchwalter. learning representations by maximizing mutual information across views. in neurips, published as a conference paper at iclr alexei baevski and michael auli. adaptive inpu...   \n",

              "3   in model design we follow the original transformer (vaswani et al., ) as closely as possible. an advantage of this intentionally simple setup is that scalable nlp transformer architectures and their efcient implementations can be used almost out of the box. vision transformer (vit) an overview of the model is depicted in figure the standard transformer receives as input a d sequence of token embeddings. to handle d images, we reshape the image x rhw c into a sequence of attened d patches xp rn(p c), where (h, w) is the resolution of the original image, c is the number of channels, (p, p) is the resolution of each image patch, and n = hw/p is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the transformer. the transformer uses constant latent vector size d through all of its layers, so we atten the patches and map to d dimensions with a trainable linear projection (eq. ). we refer to the output of this projection as the patch embeddings. similar to berts token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embed- ded patches (z = xclass), whose state at the output of the transformer encoder (z l) serves as the image representation y (eq. ). both during pre training and ne tuning, a classication head is at- tached to z l. the classication head is implemented by a mlp with one hidden layer at pre training time and by a single linear layer at ne tuning time. position embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. we use standard learnable d position embeddings, since we have not observed signicant performance gains from using more advanced d aware position embeddings (appendix d.). the resulting sequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder. the transformer encoder (vaswani et al., ) consists of alternating layers of multiheaded self- attention (msa, see appendix a) and mlp blocks (eq. , ). layernorm (ln) is applied before every block, and residual connections after ev...   \n",

              "23  axial attention (huang et al., ; ho et al., ) is a simple, yet effective technique to run self- attention on large inputs that are organized as multidimensional tensors. the general idea of axial attention is to perform multiple attention operations, each along a single axis of the input tensor, instead of applying -dimensional attention to the attened version of the input. in axial attention, each attention mixes information along a particular axis, while keeping information along the other axes independent. along this line, wang et al. (b) proposed the axialresnet model in which all the convolutions with kernel size in a resnet are replaced by axial self attention, i.e. a row and column attention, augmented by relative positional encoding. we have implemented axialresnet as a baseline model. moreover, we have modied vit to process inputs in the -dimensional shape, instead of a - dimensional sequence of patches, and incorporate axial transformer blocks, in which instead of a self attention followed by an mlp, we have a a row self attention plus an mlp followed by a column self attention plus an mlp. figure , present the performance of axial resnet, axial vit b/ and axial vit b/ on ima- genet shot linear, when pretrained on jft dataset, verses the pretraining compute, both in terms of number of flops and inference time (example per seconds). as we can see, both axial vit b/ and axial vit b/ do better than their vit b counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at our implementation is based on the open sourced pytorch implementation in https://github.com/ csrhddlam/axial deeplab. in our experiments, we reproduced the scores reported in (wang et al., b) in terms of accuracy, however, our implementation, similar to the open source implementation, is very slow on tpus. therefore, we were not able to use it for extensive large scale experiments. these may be unlocked by a carefully optimized implementation. published as a conference paper at iclr total compute...   \n",

              "15  we ne tune all vit models using sgd with a momentum of . we run a small grid search over learning rates, see learning rate ranges in table to do so, we use small sub splits from the training set (% for pets and flowers, % for cifar, % imagenet) as development set and train on the remaining data. for nal results we train on the entire training set and evaluate on the respective test data. for ne tuning resnets and hybrid models we use the exact same setup, with the only exception of imagenet where we add another value to the learning rate sweep. additionally, published as a conference paper at iclr dataset steps base lr imagenet {, , , } cifar {, , , } cifar {, , , } oxford iiit pets {, , , } oxford flowers- {, , , } vtab ( tasks) table : hyperparameters for ne tuning. all models are ne tuned with cosine learning rate decay, a batch size of , no weight decay, and grad clipping at global norm if not mentioned otherwise, ne tuning resolution is for resnets we also run the setup of kolesnikov et al. () and select the best results across this run and our sweep. finally, if not mentioned otherwise, all ne tuning experiments run at resolution (running ne tuning at different resolution than training is common practice (kolesnikov et al., )). when transferring vit models to another dataset, we remove the whole head (two linear layers) and replace it by a single, zero initialized linear layer outputting the number of classes required by the target dataset. we found this to be a little more robust than simply re initializing the very last layer. for vtab we follow the protocol in kolesnikov et al. (), and use the same hyperparameter setting for all tasks. we use a learning rate of and train for steps (tab. ). we chose this setting by running a small sweep over two learning rates and two schedules, and selecting the setting with the highest vtab score on the -example validation sets. we follow the pre processing used in kolesnikov et al. (), except that we do not use task s...  \n",

(). finally, we predict the -bit, mean color (i.e., colors in total) of every corrupted patch using their respective patch representations. we trained our self supervised model for m steps (ca. epochs) with batch size on jft. we use adam, with a base learning rate of , warmup of k steps and cosine learning rate decay. as prediction targets for pretraining we tried the following settings: ) predicting only the mean, bit color (i.e., prediction of colors), ) predicting a downsized version of the patch with bit colors in parallel (i.e., predictions of colors), ) regression on the full patch using l (i.e., regressions on the rgb channels). surprisingly, we found that all worked quite well, though l was slightly worse. we report nal results only for option ) because it has shown best few shot performance. we also experimented with % corruption rate as used by devlin et al. () but results were also slightly worse on our few shot metrics. lastly, we would like to remark that our instantiation of masked patch prediction doesnt require such an enormous amount of pretraining nor a large dataset such as jft in order to lead to sim- ilar performance gains on imagenet classication. that is, we observed diminishing returns on downstream performance after k pretraining steps, and see similar gains when pretraining on imagenet.   \n",
