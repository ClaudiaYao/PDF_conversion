              "1  we started with the aavso photometric all-sky survey\\n(apass; henden et al. 2015) dr9 catalog as our input\\nsource catalog. we selected all the apass sources with\\nv < 17 mag in all the asas-sn ﬁelds with central ﬁeld\\ncoordinates within 18 deg from the southern ecliptic pole\\n(α = 90 deg, δ = −66.55 deg). this resulted in a list of ∼1.3m\\nsources spanning a total of ∼1, 000 deg2. asas-sn v-band\\nobservations were made by the“brutus”(haleakala, hawaii)\\nand “cassius” (ctio, chile) quadruple telescopes between\\n2013 and 2018. each asas-sn ﬁeld has ∼200-600 epochs\\nof observation to a depth of v ≲17 mag. each camera has a\\nﬁeld of view of 4.5 deg2, the pixel scale is 8.\\n′′0 and the fwhm\\nis ∼2 pixels. asas-sn nominally saturates at ∼10−11 mag,\\nbut light curves of saturated sources are sometimes quite\\ngood due to corrections made for bleed trails (see kochanek\\net al. 2017).\\nthe light curves for these sources were extracted as de-\\nscribed in jayasinghe et al. (2018a) using image subtraction\\n(alard & lupton 1998; alard 2000) and aperture photome-\\ntry on the subtracted images with a 2 pixel radius aperture.\\nthe apass catalog was used for calibration. the zero point\\noﬀsets between the diﬀerent cameras were corrected as de-\\nscribed in jayasinghe et al. (2018a).\\nfigure 1 illustrates the relationship between the mea-\\nsured mean asas-sn v-band magnitudes and the apass\\ndr9 v-band magnitudes. sources with vmean ≲14 mag\\nhave similar v-band magnitudes, but a large fraction of the\\nsources with vmean ≳14 mag show a discrepancy between the\\nasas-sn and apass measurements. this is due to blend-\\ning in ﬁelds with signiﬁcant stellar densities (i.e., the lmc\\nin this work). the relatively large asas-sn pixel scale of\\n8.\\n′′0 as compared to the smaller apass pixel scale of 2.\\n′′6\\nmakes asas-sn photometry more susceptible to blending.\\nthus, asas-sn v-band measurements are systematically\\nbrighter for most sources in the lmc due to blended light.\\nthe light curve ex...   \n",
