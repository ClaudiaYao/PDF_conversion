creation and at the same time the goal of reducing the costs. network function virtualization and software defined networking represent an answer to these challenges and are changing the way ip networks are designed and operated. leveraging cloud computing principles, nfv moves the traditional data-plane network functions from expensive, closed and proprietary hardware to the so-called virtual network functions running over a distributed, cloud-like infrastructure referred to as nfvi . the sdn architecture splits the data and control planes and moves the intelligence to the sdn controller. sdn aims at simplifying the introduction of new services and fostering flexibility thanks to the centralized network state view. the concept of services chaining is directly associated to nfv. actually, the idea of creating a processing path across services pre-dates the nfv concept as stated in and . in fact, service chaining has been traditionally realized in a static way by putting hardware functions as middle-points of the processing paths and in some cases by diverting the forwarding paths with manual configuration of vlans stitching or policy routing. however, these static approaches comes with several drawbacks which are detailed in . in particular, they are intrinsically difficult to scale and hard to reconfigure. on the other hand, the current view of sfc applied to nfv is that it has to be highly dynamic and scalable.the ietf sfc working group has investigated the scenarios and issues related to dynamic service chaining and proposed a reference architecture . the main logical elements of this architecture are i) classifiers; ii) service functions forwarders , iii) the service functions, iv) sfc proxies. the classifiers match the traffic against a set of policies in order to associate the proper service function chain. the sffs forward the traffic towards the service functions or towards other sffs and handle the traffic coming back from the service functions. the sfc framework proposed in does not pose any restriction on the function that can be chained: they can be both virtualized or physical functions . for the sake of simplicity, hereafter in the paper we will only refer to the virtualized case and will simply use the term vnf instead of service function. in this scenario, the forwarding of traffic along a service chain needs to be supported by specific protocols and mechanisms that allow the architectural elements to exchange context information. the vnfs can participate to these chaining mechanisms and in this case they are called sfc aware. on the other hand, the legacy vnfs that do not interact with the sfc protocols and mechanisms are called sfc unaware. the sfc proxy elements are needed for the latter type of vnfs. an sfc proxy hides the sfc mechanisms to the sfc unaware vnfs, that will receive and send plain ip traffic. the ietf sfc wg is considering the network service header as a specific solution for the realization of the sfc architecture. the nsh header defines the service-level data-plane encapsulation for realizing the vnfs chaining. the nsh header identifies a service chain which is associated to the packets. moreover, it defines the packet meta-data that arxiv:1901.00936v3 23 jul 2019 can be inserted into the header to exchange state between the nodes of the sfc architecture. in this work we are advocating the use of ipv6 segment routing to implement service function chaining , . segment routing , is a form of source routing, which allows to add a sequence of segments in the packet headers to influence the packet forwarding and processing within the network. segment routing has been designed and implemented for the mpls and ipv6 data planes, we only focus here on the ipv6 version, denoted as srv6. in the srv6 architecture, the segments are expressed as ipv6 addresses. the srv6 network programming model , leveraging the huge ipv6 addressing space, extends the srv6 architecture from a simple forwarding mechanism for steering packets to a more general network programming abstraction. a segment can represent an instruction or behavior and not only a network location. our proposed approach is fully aligned with the network programming model described in . the srv6 architecture is not limited to service function chaining, which represents only a possible use case. indeed, srv6 can support several applications in a network provider backbone like traffic engineering, network resilience , virtual private networks , multicast, content delivery networks . with respect to the mpls based data plane, srv6 it has the advantage that it can be better integrated in host networking stack. for this reason data center applications could also benefit from srv6. a relevant subset of the srv6 and network programming model specifications have been implemented and integrated in the mainline linux kernel . in this paper, we rely on this existing work and extend it to focus on the service function chaining of legacy vnfs, which are not able to process the srv6 headers. the support of legacy vnfs is important for internet service providers for different reasons: i) it guarantees a feasible migration strategy saving past investments; ii) it facilitates the interoperability and the multi-vendor scenarios, i.e deployments composed by vnfs of different vendors; iii) the development of srv6 aware vnfs requires a new implementation cycle which can be more expensive in the short period. as introduced above, a proxy element needs to be inserted in the processing chain as relay mechanism in order to support srv6 unaware vnfs . the latest linux kernel still lacks of the functionality to implement such srv6 proxy element. in a prior work , we have provided this functionality as an external module not integrated with the most recent srv6 developments in the linux kernel. considering the importance of the support of legacy sr-unaware applications in nfv deployments, the main contribution this paper is the design and implementation of an sr-proxy integrated in the linux kernel networking components. we refer to this work as srnk . we designed a first version of srnk and evaluated its performance, identifying a poor scalability with respect to the number of vnfs to be supported. the issue is actually related to the implementation of policy routing framework in linux. therefore we provided a second design, enhancing the fig. 1: srv6 nfv node with sr-proxy for sr-unaware vnf linux policy routing framework, whose performance does not depend on the number of supported vnfs in a node. the content of the paper is as follows. section ii introduces sfc based on srv6 considering both srv6 aware and unaware vnfs. the proposed design and implementation of srv6 proxy to support legacy vnfs in the linux kernel is described in section iii. our testing environment and methodologies for performance analysis are reported in section iv. sections v details the performance evaluation of the implemented solutions. finally, in section vii we draw some conclusions and discuss future work. this work has been performed in the context of the rose research project which focuses on the development of an open source srv6 ecosystem. the source code of all components of srnk including the patches to the user space utilities are freely available at .\",\n          \"in this section we present the design of our first kernel implementation of the dynamic proxy , referred to as srnkv1. most of the following design choices apply also to the static proxy , which can be seen as a by-product of the the dynamic proxy implementation. in order to simplify the discussion we just mention the dynamic proxy in the paragraphs and in the images. srnkv1 design relies on two distinct lwts which manage respectively the inbound and fromvnf traffic. for each lwt, state information is maintained in order to correctly perform the proxy operations. in particular, the inbound processing needs an entry on the my local sid table and uses a pernetwork namespace hashtable to store the headers that have to be restored during the fromvnf processing. as regards the traffic coming from the legacy vnf, a policy routing entry for each vnf is necessary to classify the packets, a routing table with a default route pointing to the lwt is used for the vnf and finally the per-netns hashtable is used to read the headers stored previously by the inbound processing. figures 4 show an high-level view of the processing inside a srv6 enabled node and how ipv6 routing network subsystem interacts with the srv6 dynamic proxy implementation. 1) inbound processing: the inbound processing is depicted in figure 4a. as soon as an ipv6 packet arrives at interface eth0 of the nfv node, it enters into the linux networking stack. after passing the pre-routing stage, the kernel tries to look up the route with the longest prefix that matches the active segment of the packet. due to policy-routing settings, the linux kernel looks first at my local sid table and if no matching route has been found, it considers the other tables and possibly moves on the next stages of the processing . figure 4a shows this process in details, the packet destination address matches with prefix sid1 and the correspondent route is used. therefore, the linux kernel executes the processing function associated with the route: the inbound end.ad operation. the inbound end.ad operates in three different stages: i) it pops the outer ipv6 and srv6 headers from the incoming packet; ii) it updates the sid pointer of the srv6 header to select the next one; iii) it stores such retrieved headers into a per-netns hashtable data structure; iv) it sends out the decapsulated ipv6 plain packet to its designated legacy vnf. removed headers at step are indexed in the per-netns hashtable by using the identifier of the packet outgoing interface , the one used to communicate with the legacy vnf . due to the necessity of sharing ipv6 and srv6 headers between inbound and fromvnf processing, the choice of storing them within a external shared data structure turned out to be the right solution. this design simplifies the access pattern to the stored data, as well as it increases performance. indeed, the hashtable is well suitable to support fast data retrieving with a very low computational cost and, ideally it is independent with regard to the number inbound processing fromvnf processing fig. 4: srnkv1 design of stored entries. from a configuration point of view, the inbound processing just relies on the plain ipv6 routing through my local sid table: the new route is added with the ip -6 route add command of the iproute2 suite, by also specifying the behavior to be activated in the parameters of the command. appendix a provides further details on the configuration of the inbound processing. 2) auto-learning process: the auto-learning process consists in learning the information related of the vnfs chain from the inbound packets, without the need of a static configuration. the learned information is saved in a per-netns hashtable. we have introduced an age parameter to control the rate at which the per-netns hashtable can be updated. this parameter can be set during the setup of the lwt routing entry in my local sid table. when different from 0, the age parameter represents the minimum interval between two write operations in the per-netns hashtable for the same vnf. setting the age to 1 second corresponds to a maximum reconfiguration delay of 1 second for a nfv node when the vnf chain is changed by an ingress node and this is the default we used in our experiments. if age equals 0, the per-netns hashtable is updated for every inbound packets, providing the fastest possible reconfiguration time for a vnf chain. in the performance evaluation section, we have analyzed the performance cost for the continuous updating of the per-netns hashtable with respect to the default minimum reconfiguration delay of 1 second. the age parameter registers the last time the headers have been updated and it is used also to determine, when a packet is received, if it is the time to replace stale data with new fresh one. the auto-learning operation is performed only during the inbound processing. the learned information is retrieved during the fromvnf processing using the incoming interface2 of the packet to rebuild the whole srv6 packet ready for being forwarded into the network. setting properly the age parameter has an important impact on the performance of the system and a proper trade-off is necessary according to the use case to be supported. in a shared-memory producer-consumer context, we can identify the inbound processing as the content producer, and the fromvnf one as the consumer. indeed, the former is in charge of keeping the per-netns hashtable up-to-date, while the latter accesses the structure for retrieving the headers. considering this model, the aging parameter can be seen as the upper-bound of data production/refresh rate. by setting it to the maximum limit, it is possible to prevent overloading of the srv6 nfv node caused by high-rate writing in the shared memory. this problem is particularly noticeable in all of those systems based on multi-core architectures: the linux networking stack allows to assign the received packets to all available computing units in order to process them in parallel and to support high data rates. however, this means that several end.ad processing operations may occur at once and, potentially, they may involve updating the same ipv6 and srv6 headers. very frequent and simultaneous shared memory updates by multiple cpus can lead to conflicts that can negatively affect the overall performance of the system. for all these reasons, small values of the age parameter make the system more responsive to chain changes, but on the other side they can push heavy and unnecessarily load to the srv6 nfv node due to high data refresh rate. 3) end.as design: the end.ad differs from the end.as just on the way the stored headers are managed. the end.as behavior is a simplification of the end.ad because it does 2the current implementation of the dynamic proxy assumes that the same interface is used to interact with vnf in the two directions not need to deal with the auto-learning process. indeed, it uses chain information which has been saved once during the behavior configuration. the list of segments does not change during the entire life of the end.as instance unless it is first deleted and then saved with new headers values. 4) fromvnf processing: the fromvnf lwt tunnel is meant to work in tandem with its inbound counterpart. fromvnf packets do not carry any sid as it happens for the inbound ones. as result, in order to select the correct lwt tunnel and processing each packet accordingly, we can rely only on the incoming interface between the vnf and the nfv node through which packets come back. hence, we add an entry in the ipv6 routing policy db for each vnf to be supported. every rpdb entry is also known as ipv6 rule, as the command used to configure it is ip -6 rule. the rule points to a different routing table for each vnf, in which there is only a default route, pointing to the lwt tunnel associated to the vnf. this means that for n vnfs, we will have n rules and n routing tables. figure 4b provides a representation of the described fromvnf processing. let us analyze with more details the motivation for this design. the fromvnf lwt tunnel can not be tied to any route with a specific prefix because the ipv6 packets sent by vnf can use any destination address and do not have any relationship with the sids. moreover, each end.ad fromvnf tunnel expects to receive traffic by its own layer-2 interface , with no regards about the ipv6 destination address of the packets. this means that, in order to apply the fromvnf processing function to an incoming packet, the srv6 nfv node has to retrieve the route that points to the right lwt tunnel using only the identifier of the interface where such as packet has been received. as a consequence of this, the fromvnf end.ad design has to deal with: i) the problem of designating an ipv6 prefix to be used for creating a route pointing to a custom processing function , and ii) the issue of steering incoming traffic received on a specific interface through such as route. the first issue can be easily solved by using as route prefix the any address which is often indicated by ::. generally, the default route is selected by the routing algorithm when the ipv6 destination address can not be managed by any other. however, this usage gives rise to a new problem. indeed, creating a lwt on a default route has the side effect that no more than one vnf can be handled by the srv6 node using a single table. moreover, control traffic that transits through the srv6 node and for which there are no given explicit routes may be wrongly handled by the lwt installed on the default route. thankfully, this problem can be easily solved by installing every default route into a different ipv6 routing table and creating, for each of these, a rule in the ipv6 routing policy db. such rule is meant to instruct the ipv6 network system to perform route look-up on a specific table based on a specified match. the usage of an ipv6 policy route solves also the issue ii) as at this point we can use the fromvnf interface as match and a goto-table n as action predicate. in this way we can relate an interface to a specific default route that has attached to a lwt. figure 4b shows an high-level overview of proposed solution with the fromvnf lwt tunnel integrated in the ipv6 routing network subsystem. whenever a plain ipv6 packets, sent by vnf, arrives at srv6 nfv node, it is handled by the linux networking stack. after passing the pre-routing stage, the kernel tries to determine the right processing of the packet. it invokes the route look-up operation, but this time the routing algorithm finds first an entry in the rpdb of the node and does not consider ipv6 destination address at first. indeed, thanks to custom ipv6 rules the routing algorithm is capable to retrieve the ipv6 table tied to the incoming interface of the packet. at this point, the routing algorithm makes use of this table to find out the route that matches with the received packet. in this specific case, the routing algorithm selects and returns the only route available, the default one, that is attached to a specific end.ad tunnel. once the plain ipv6 packet has been received by the fromvnf processing function, it leverages the identifier of the incoming interface of the packet to search for the popped ipv6 and srv6 headers within the per-netns hashtable. if a result is found, the processing function forges a new packet and sets the headers of such as packet with those that have just been retrieved. the plain ipv6 packet is encapsulated into the newly created one and then the whole packet is delivered towards its destination. this concludes the job of the fromvnf lwt tunnel processing operation.\",\n          \"the segment routing architecture is based on the source routing approach : it is possible to include a list of instructions in the packet headers. a comprehensive survey on segment routing can be found in this work considers the use of srv6 for sfc, leveraging its scalability properties.thanks to the source routing approach, srv6 is able to simplify network operations. generally speaking, the advantage of approaches based on source routing lies in the possibility to add state information in the packet headers, thus avoiding or minimizing the information that needs to be configured and maintained by the internal nodes. the possibility to interact only with the edge nodes to setup complex services is extremely appealing from the point of view of simplicity and efficiency. this greatly improves the scalability of services based on sr and allows simpler and faster service setup and re-configuration. in the scaling capability of segment routing has been demonstrated considering an use case of 600,000 nodes and 300 millions of endpoints. by exploiting the srv6 approach the vnfs can be mapped in ipv6 addresses in the segments list and we can represent the vnf chain using this list carried in the segment routing header . the sr information can be pushed into the packets using two different approaches, denoted as insert and encap modes, respectively.according to the srv6 network programming document , when a node uses the insert mode the srh is pushed as next header in the original ipv6 packet, immediately after the ipv6 header and before the transport header. the original ipv6 header is changed, in particular the next header is modified according to the value of srh, the ipv6 destination address is replaced with the ipv6 address of the first sid in the segment list, while the original ipv6 destination address is carried in the srh header as the last segment of the list. in this work we only consider the encap mode: the original ipv6 packet is transported as the inner packet of an ipv6in-ipv6 encapsulated packet and travels unmodified in the network. the outer ipv6 packet carries the srh header with the segments list.1 an sr-aware vnf can process the srh of the incoming packets and can use it to influence the processing/forwarding of the packets. such vnfs interact with the node operating system or with sr modules in order to read and/or set the information contained in the srh. on the other side, the srunaware vnfs are not capable to process the srv6 sfc encapsulation. in this scenario an sr proxy is necessary to remove the srv6 header and deliver a clean ip packet to the vnf. figure 1 provides the reference architecture for a srv6 nfv node that includes an sr-unaware vnf . we refer to packets incoming to the srv6 nfv node that should be forwarded to the vnf by the srproxy as inbound packets. the sr-proxy needs to intercept the packets coming out from the vnf and re-apply the srv6 sfc encapsulation. we refer to these packets as fromvnf packets. in , a set of sr-proxy behaviors have been defined, among them we mention: i) static proxy ; ii) dynamic proxy ; iii) masquerading proxy . the first two cases support ipv6 sr packets in encap mode. the encapsulated packets can be ipv6, ipv4 or l2 packets. the sr proxy intercepts sr packets before being handed to the sr-unaware vnf, hence it can remove the sr encapsulation from packets. for packets coming back from sr-unaware vnf, the sr proxy can restore the srv6 encapsulation updating the srh properly. the difference between the static and the dynamic proxies is that the sr information that needs to be pushed back in the packets is statically configured in the first case and it is learned from the incoming packets in the dynamic case.instead, the masquerading proxy supports sr packets travelling in insert mode. it masquerades the sr packets before they are sent to the legacy vnf by replacing the ipv6 destination address with the original ipv6 destination . it is assumed that a vnf compatible with this operating mode is processing ipv6 packets and does not alter the srh, it just ignores it. in this way, when packets are received back, the sr proxy can restore the correct information in the ipv6 header in a stateless way, just using the information contained in the srh. 1as any tunneling method, srv6 introduces overhead the packets. the insert mode introduces an overhead of 8 + n *16 where n is the number of segments, while in the encap mode the overhead is 40 + 8 + n *16. let us discuss the operational model and the state information that need to be configured and maintained in the srv6 nfv nodes. figure 2 illustrates a srv6 based nfv domain, in which the vnfs are hosted in different nfv nodes. the packets to be associated to vnf chains are classified in ingress nodes, where the sr encapsulation is added. a network operator willing to use srv6 sfc chaining for srunaware vnfs, will first need to associate vnfs to segment ids in the hosting srv6 nfv nodes. we recall that a sid is represented by an ipv6 address. each srv6 nfv node has a pool of ipv6 addresses that are available to be used as sids for its vnfs. these prefixes are distributed using regular routing protocols, so that the reachability of all vnfs is assured. the association of the ipv6 address sid to a vnf is a configuration operation to be performed in the srv6 nfv node and it binds the sid to the virtual interface that connects the sr-proxy to the vnf. this operation is performed when a legacy vnf is created in a nfv node. the corresponding state information is used in the inbound direction, when packets directed to the vnf are processed by the sr-proxy. the second step is to configure a vnf chain across the vnfs that are running over the srv6 nfv nodes. the vnf chain will be applied to a packet by inserting a sid list in the ipv6 sr header in the ingress node. therefore, the classification of packets and the association with the sid list has to be configured in the ingress node. each nfv node which runs a legacy vnf needs the proper information to process the packets in the fromvnf direction. this is done differently for the respective types of proxy. in the static proxy case , the state information needed to process the packets coming from the vnf is done by statically configuring the sr-proxy with the sid list to be re-inserted in the packet. both the dynamic proxy and the masquerading one have the good property that they do not need to be configured when a new chain is added. the dynamic proxy learns the sid list from the packets in the inbound direction . the masquerading proxy does not even need to save the state information as the sid list is carried along with the packet through the legacy vnf . table i compares the different sr proxy behaviors. in this table i: comparison of sr proxy behaviours end.ad end.as end.am generate traffic yes yes no modify packets yes yes no stateless no no yes state-config auto manual n/a traffic supported ipv4/ipv6/l2 ipv4/ipv6/l2 ipv6 work, we focus on the design and in-kernel implementation of the sr dynamic proxy as it represents the most versatile solution and it offers a simple operational model. fig. 2: sfc scenario\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
