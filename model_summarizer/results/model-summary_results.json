        "Generated Summary": " crowd counting problem aims to count the number of objects within an image or a frame in the videos and is usually solved by estimating the density map generated from the object location annotations. in contrast to traditional methods which do not differentiate the density prediction of these two states, we propose to use a dedicated network branch to predict the object/non-object mask and then combine its prediction with the input image to produce the density map. our rationale is that the mask prediction could be better modeled as a binary segmentation problem and the difficulty of estimating the density could be reduced if the mask is known. to this end, we study five possible solutions, and via analysis and experimental validation we identify the most effective one. through extensive experiments on five public datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over the baselines and show that our network could achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

        "Generated Summary": " rowd counting is a significant topic for crowd understanding and analysis -, which has attracted much attention in multimedia and computer vision community due to large and practical demands for better management, safety and security,. it aims to count the number of objects within an image or a frame in the videos and is a very challenging problem because the objects-of-interest, e.g, people, can occur at a variety of scales, with heavy occlusions and cluttered visual appearances. also, due to the difficulty in providing highly detailed annotations such as object bounding boxes or instance-level segmentation masks, existing datasets usually adopt a weak-level annotating scheme by labeling each object with a dot inside. these challenges make the traditional detection based approach less robust - and most existing methods - choose to solve this problem by estimating a density map generated from the dot-level annotation. in this paper, we propose to use a dedicated branch of a network to first predict the foreground/background mask, and then fuse the prediction with the input image to produce the final density map estimation to produce the final density map estimation.
