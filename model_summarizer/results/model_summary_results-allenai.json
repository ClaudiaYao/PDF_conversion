The network is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. It utilizes a nested partitioning of the input point set to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. by exploiting metric space distances, point sets are sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities. The study of point sets is challenging due to limitations in capturing local structures induced by metric space points, limiting the network's ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. with further observation that point sets typically sampled with different densities results in reduced performance compared to networks trained with uniform density, novel set learning layers are proposed to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. experiments show that pointnet is able learn deep features efficiently, robustly, and efficiently."

            "The text discusses the design of a hierarchical neural network, named as pointnet++, to process a set of points sampled in a metric space in a hierarchical fashion. Similar to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), pointnet is a pioneering effort that directly processes point sets. The study of point sets is challenging due to the entanglement of feature scale and non-uniformity of input point set. The paper introduces a new approach called pointNet++, which leverages local feature learning to abstract sets of points or features into higher level representations. The approach involves partitioning the point set into overlapping local regions by a distance metric, and applying pointnet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input set. Each partition is defined as a neighborhood ball in the underlying euclidean space, whose parameters include centroid location and scale. Different neighborhoods are further grouped into larger units and processed to produce higher level features. This process is repeated until the features of the whole point set are obtained. A key contribution of the paper is the introduction of a local feature learner called pointnet. The network learns a spatial encoding of each point and then aggregates all individual point features to form a global point cloud signature. The proposed approach"

The segmentation function assigns labels to each point in the metric space and assigns a label per point to each subset of points.

The interpolated features are then concatenated with skip linked point features from the set abstraction level. These features are passed through a unit pointnet, which is similar to one-by-one convolution in cnns. The process is repeated until features are propagated to original set."

The study focuses on the problem of point feature extraction using convolutional neural network.

Different approaches have been developed regarding this, including volumetric grids, geometric graphs, and geometric graphs. However, in none of these works, the problem has been explicitly considered. In contrast to these approaches, the text focuses on unordered points sampled from a metric space, with non-uniform sampling density. This introduces difficulty for learning, especially for point features extraction, as point sampled from metric space are usually noisy and with noisy sampling density, leading to difficulty in extracting point features.
