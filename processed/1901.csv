abstract
the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn) provides long baseline (∼4
yrs) light curves for sources brighter than v≲17 mag across the whole sky. the tran-
siting exoplanet survey satellite (tess) has started to produce high-quality light
curves with a baseline of at least 27 days, eventually for most of the sky. the combi-
nation of asas-sn and tess light curves probes both long and short term variability
in great detail, especially towards the tess continuous viewing zones (cvz) at the
ecliptic poles. we have produced ∼1.3 million v-band light curves covering a total of
∼1000 deg2 towards the southern tess cvz and have systematically searched these
sources for variability. we have identiﬁed ∼11, 700 variables, including ∼7, 000 new dis-
coveries. the light curves and characteristics of the variables are all available through
the asas-sn variable stars database (https://asas-sn.osu.edu/variables). we
also introduce an online resource to obtain pre-computed asas-sn v-band light
curves (https://asas-sn.osu.edu/photometry) starting with the light curves of the
∼1.3 million sources studied in this work. this eﬀort will be extended to provide asas-
sn light curves for ∼50 million sources over the entire sky.

introduction
",,
2 Observations and Data reduction,"we started with the aavso photometric all-sky survey
(apass; henden et al. 2015) dr9 catalog as our input
source catalog. we selected all the apass sources with
v < 17 mag in all the asas-sn ﬁelds with central ﬁeld
coordinates within 18 deg from the southern ecliptic pole
(α = 90 deg, δ = −66.55 deg). this resulted in a list of ∼1.3m
sources spanning a total of ∼1, 000 deg2. asas-sn v-band
observations were made by the“brutus”(haleakala, hawaii)
and “cassius” (ctio, chile) quadruple telescopes between
2013 and 2018. each asas-sn ﬁeld has ∼200-600 epochs
of observation to a depth of v ≲17 mag. each camera has a
ﬁeld of view of 4.5 deg2, the pixel scale is 8.
′′0 and the fwhm
is ∼2 pixels. asas-sn nominally saturates at ∼10−11 mag,
but light curves of saturated sources are sometimes quite
good due to corrections made for bleed trails (see kochanek
et al. 2017).
the light curves for these sources were extracted as de-
scribed in jayasinghe et al. (2018a) using image subtraction
(alard & lupton 1998; alard 2000) and aperture photome-
try on the subtracted images with a 2 pixel radius aperture.
the apass catalog was used for calibration. the zero point
oﬀsets between the diﬀerent cameras were corrected as de-
scribed in jayasinghe et al. (2018a).
figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the mea-
sured mean asas-sn v-band magnitudes and the apass
dr9 v-band magnitudes. sources with vmean ≲14 mag
have similar v-band magnitudes, but a large fraction of the
sources with vmean ≳14 mag show a discrepancy between the
asas-sn and apass measurements. this is due to blend-
ing in ﬁelds with signiﬁcant stellar densities (i.e., the lmc
in this work). the relatively large asas-sn pixel scale of
8.
′′0 as compared to the smaller apass pixel scale of 2.
′′6
makes asas-sn photometry more susceptible to blending.
thus, asas-sn v-band measurements are systematically
brighter for most sources in the lmc due to blended light.
the light curve extraction provides a statistical error
estimate, but the scatter in the light curves of apparently
non-variable sources is generally larger than expected given
the nominal statistical uncertainties. in jayasinghe et al.
(2018a), we used the reduced χ2 statistic,

is the mean v-band magnitude to determine the typical to-
tal uncertainty σ(vmean) as a function of magnitude. in this
work, we update our approach to estimating the systematic
uncertainties in the asas-sn photometry.
we can view the photometric errors as the quadrature
sum of the estimated statistical uncertainty σstat and a sys-
tematic σsys , with
σ2 = σ2
sys + σ2
stat .
(2)
we can measure σ as the root-mean-square (rms) scatter in
the light curves of non-variable stars, and then subtract the
estimated statistical errors to derive σsys, with the results
shown in figure 2 for the 1.3m sources in our sample. for
sources with vmean < 13 mag, the photometric uncertainties
approach an asas-sn error ﬂoor of ∼0.02 mag. for the
sources with vmean > 13 mag, we ﬁt a third order polynomial,
log σsys = a(x −13)3 + b(x −13)2 + c(x −13) −1.738,
(3)
with a = −1.03×10−2, b = 8.6×10−2, and c = 3.6×10−2 to the
median of the σsys versus vmean distribution. the polynomial
smoothly joins to 0.02 mag at v = 13 mag. to correct the
errors in the light curves, we replace the formal magnitude
errors by using equation 2 and either equation 3 or 0.02 mag
for σsys.
we also identiﬁed a systematic issue that aﬀects the
light curves of certain sources due to malfunctioning shut-
ters. the shutters in the asas-sn cameras periodically
start to fail. degraded shutters do not close completely, and
stray light from neighboring bright sources can impart trails
on the images during readout (figure 3). this systematic
is illustrated in the light curve for the non-variable source
j072955.48-521556.8 (figure 3). we see that after the mal-
functioning shutter is replaced, the light curve returns to

cross-matched the apass sources to external catalogues in
section §3.1. in section §3.2, we describe the procedure we
took to identify candidate variable sources. in section §3.3,
we discuss the application of the v2 random forest classiﬁer
model from jayasinghe et al. (2018b) to classify these vari-
ables, and in section §3.4, we discuss the corrections done to
mitigate the eﬀects of blending on the candidate variables.
3.1
cross-matches to external catalogs
"
3 Variability Analysis,,3.4 Blending Corrections,"the large pixel scale of the asas-sn images (8.
′′0) and the
fwhm (∼16.
′′0) results in blending towards crowded re-
gions. the apass catalog was constructed with images that
have a signiﬁcantly smaller pixel scale (2.
′′6), and as a result
of this, multiple apass sources can fall into a single asas-
sn pixel. we do not correct for the contaminating light in
the photometry of the blended sources, but we identify and
correct blended variable groups in our catalog.
since we extracted light curves for the positions of
apass sources, we can have two or more such sources inside
a single asas-sn resolution element. if we select the sources
with another apass neighbor within 30.
′′0, we ﬁnd that 559
of the ∼12, 300 variables had a neighbor within 30.
′′0. we
compute the ﬂux variability amplitudes for these sources
using a random forest regression model (jayasinghe et al.
2018b). the majority of the variable groups consisted of two
sources, with a few groups consisting of up to three sources.
for each variable group, we consider the source with the
largest ﬂux variability as the ‘true’ variable, and remove the
other overlapping sources from the ﬁnal list. following this
treatment, our list of variables consisted of ∼11, 700 sources.
"
4 Results,"the complete catalog of ∼11, 700 variables is available
at the asas-sn variable stars database (https://asas-
sn.osu.edu/variables) along with the v-band light curves for
each source. table 2 lists the number of sources of each vari-
ability type in the catalog.
in paper ii, we used the reddening-free wesenheit mag-
nitudes (madore 1982; lebzelter et al. 2018)
wrp = mgrp −1.3(gbp −grp),
(6)
and
wjk = mks −0.686(j −ks)
(7)
for variability classiﬁcation. the wesenheit wrp vs. gbp −
grp color-magnitude diagram for all the variables is shown
in figure 7. we have sorted the variables into groups to
highlight the diﬀerent classes of variable sources. owing to
the magnitude limit of asas-sn, we are only able to detect
suﬃciently bright sources (v ≲16 mag, wrp ≲1.5 mag) in
the lmc. this is evident in the wesenheit color-magnitude
diagram for the lmc sources. for the sources outside the
lmc, we probe a wider range of magnitudes (wrp ≲6
mag), including rr lyrae, rotational variables and δ scuti
variables.
we have also plotted the wesenheit wrp vs. gbp −
grp color-magnitude diagram for all the periodic variables
in figure 8, with the points colored according to the period.
this essentially highlights the large dynamic range in period
probed by the asas-sn light curves.
we note that the identiﬁcation of mira variables in the
lmc is hindered by blending. due to blended light, the ob-
served asas-sn amplitudes of these sources fall below the
amplitude threshold of v > 2 mag that is used to deﬁne a
mira variable in our pipeline. in reality, some fraction of the
lmc semi-regular variables in this catalog are actually mira
variables. from the sample of known semi-regular variables
in the lmc, we estimate that the fraction of mira variables
classiﬁed as semi-regular variables is ∼23%.
using the same color scheme, the combined wesenheit
wjk plr diagram for the periodic variables is shown in
figure 9. the plr sequences for the cepheids and semi-
regular variables in the lmc are well deﬁned (soszynski
et al. 2005). most of the eclipsing binaries identiﬁed in the
lmc are either detached or semi-detached systems, and do
not follow the well deﬁned plr for contact binaries that
is observed in the plr diagram for the sources outside the
lmc.
we also show the sky distribution of the variables iden-
tiﬁed in this work in figure 10. we see that the distribution
of eclipsing binaries and rotational variables (black points)
is random, but the distribution of cepheids is strongly clus-
tered towards the lmc as is expected. we also note the
clustering of semi-regular/irregular variables (red giants) to-
wards the lmc and the galactic disk.
we matched our list of variables to the vsx (watson et
al. 2006) catalog available in october 2018, with a matching
radius of 16.
′′0 to identify previously discovered variables.

the variables discovered by the all-sky automated survey
(asas; pojmanski 2002) and the catalina real-time tran-
sient survey (crts; drake et al. 2014) are included in the
vsx database. we also match our variables to the cata-
logs of variable stars discovered by asas-sn (jayasinghe et
al. 2018a), the catalogs of variable stars in the magellanic
clouds and the galactic bulge from the optical gravita-
tional lensing experiment (ogle; udalski 2003; pawlak
et al. 2016; soszy´
nski et al. 2016, and references therein),
the gaia dr2 catalog of variables (gaia collaboration et
al. 2018a; holl et al. 2018; gaia collaboration et al. 2018b),
the catalog of variables from the asteroid terrestrial-impact
last alert system (atlas; tonry et al. 2018; heinze et al.
2018), the catalog of kelt variables (oelkers et al. 2018)
and the variables from macho (alcock et al. 1997). of the
∼11, 700 variables identiﬁed in this work, ∼4, 700 were pre-
viously discovered by other surveys, as also listed in table
2. the majority of these known variables consist of eclips-
ing binaries (∼31%), irregular/semi-regular variables (∼28%)
and cepheids (∼19%).
this leaves ∼7, 000 new variables. most of the new dis-
coveries are eclipsing binaries (∼35%) and irregular/semi-
regular variables (∼23%). we also discovered 128 new gcas
variables, 81 of which are located in the lmc. gcas vari-
ables are rapidly rotating, early-type irregular variable stars
(typically be stars) with mass outﬂow from their equatorial
regions. example light curves for the newly identiﬁed gcas
variables are shown in figure 12.
we also discovered another long period detached eclips-
ing binary (asassn-v j080709.46−591028.3) in this work.
asassn-v j080709.46−591028.3 is located away from the
lmc and has an orbital period of porb∼682 d (∼1.9 yr). its
light curve shows evidence of both a primary and secondary
eclipse with a primary eclipse depth of ∼1 mag (figure 11).
a non-negligible fraction of these new discoveries were
classiﬁed as generic variables (∼20%). these are mostly low
amplitude or faint sources. example light curves are shown
for a subset of the newly discovered periodic (irregular) vari-
ables in figure 9 (10).

5 Conclusions,"we
systematically
searched
for
variable
sources
in
a
∼1000 deg2 region surrounding the southern ecliptic pole.
this region is coincident with the southern continuous view-
ing zone for the tess satellite and thus, a large majority of
these sources will have excellent tess light curves.
through our search, we identiﬁed ∼11, 700 variable
sources, of which ∼7, 000 are new discoveries. variable
sources identiﬁed in the lmc largely consist of luminous
variables, including cepheids, gcas variables (be stars)
and red giants. we identify a broader sample of variables
outside the lmc, including rr lyrae, eclipsing binaries,
rotational variables and δ scuti variables.
we have developed a user friendly interface to re-
trieve pre-computed asas-sn v-band light curves for
apass sources. the v-band light curves of all the ∼1.3m

sources studied in this work are available online at the
asas-sn photometry database (https://asas-sn.osu.
edu/photometry). to highlight the possible blended sources,
a ﬂag is assigned to each source if the distance to the nearest
apass neighbor is <16.
′′0. the new variable sources have
also been added to the asas-sn variable stars database
(https://asas-sn.osu.edu/variables).
as part of our ongoing eﬀort to systematically analyze
all the ∼50 million v < 17 mag apass sources for variabil-
ity, we will gradually update this database with the light
curves for the sources across the remainder of the sky over
the course of 2019. this work provides long baseline v-band
light curves for a large fraction of the sources in the tess
southern cvz and is a useful supplement to the short base-
line tess light curves that possess better photometric pre-
cision.
