       "  'Text': 'the study of stellar variability has been invigorated by the advent of modern large scale sky surveys in the modern era. recent surveys such as the all sky automated survey (asas; pojmanski ), the optical gravitational lensing experiment (ogle; udalski ),the northern sky vari- ability survey (nsvs; wozniak et al. ), macho (al- e mail: jayasinghearachchilage.@osu.edu cock et al. ), eros (derue et al. ), the catalina real time transient survey (crts; drake et al. ), the asteroid terrestrial impact last alert system (atlas; tonry et al. ; heinze et al. ), and gaia (gaia col- laboration et al. a; holl et al. ; gaia collaboration et al. b) have collectively discovered variables. variable stars are excellent astrophysical probes and have been used in numerous astronomical contexts. pul- sating variables such as cepheids and rr lyrae stars are commonly used as distance indicators owing to the period the authors arxiv:v dec t. jayasinghe et al. luminosity relationships seen amongst these variables (e.g., leavitt ; matsunaga et al. ; beaton et al. , and references therein). eclipsing binary stars are excellent probes of stellar systems and with sucient radial velocity followup, allow for the derivation of useful astrophysical pa- rameters, including the masses and radii, of the stars in these systems (torres et al. ). variable stars are also useful for the study of stellar populations and galactic structure (matsunaga ; feast, & whitelock ) . until recently, the all sky automated survey for super- novae (asas sn, shappee et al. ; kochanek et al. ) monitored the visible sky to a depth of v mag with a cadence of - days using two units in chile and hawaii each with telescopes. starting in , asas sn expanded to units with telescopes. the new units all started with g band lters and the original units have now switched to g band as well. the asas sn telescopes are hosted by the las cumbres observatory (lco; brown et al. ) in hawaii, chile, texas and south africa. asas sn primarily focuses on the detection of bright supernovae (e.g., holoien et al. , a), tidal disruption events (e.g.,holoien et al. , , b) and other transients (e.g., tucker et al. ; rodrguez et al. ), but its excellent baseline allows for the study of variability amongst the million bright (v < mag) sources across the whole sky. asas sn team members have also studied the relative specic type ia su- penovae rates (brown et al. ) and the largest amplitude m dwarf ares seen in asas sn (schmidt et al. ). in paper i (jayasinghe et al. a), we reported , new variables that were agged during the search for supernovae, most of which are located in regions close to the galactic plane or celestial poles which were not well- sampled by previous surveys. in paper ii (jayasinghe et al. b), we uniformly analyzed , known variables from the vsx catalog, and developed a robust variability classier utilizing the asas sn v band light curves and data from external catalogues. we have also explored the synergy between asas sn and apogee (holtzman et al. ) with the discovery of the rst likely non interacting binary composed of a black hole with a eld red giant (thompson et al. ) and a detailed variability analysis of the apogee sources to identify periodic variables (pawlak et al., in prep). we have also identied rare vari- ables, including very long period detached eclipsing bina- ries (jayasinghe et al. c,d) and r coronae borealis stars (shields et al. ) . the transiting exoplanet survey satellite (tess; ricker et al. ) will produce a large number of high- quality light curves with a baseline of at least days for most of the sky. the tess input catalog (tic; stassun et al. ) contains million sources, out of which , selected targets are observed at a min cadence, while the remaining sources are observed with a cadence of min. oelkers et al. () recently identied variable sources in a sample of million tic sources, but did not classify these variables into explicit types. these sources were classied in paper ii using asas sn data. sources closer to the tess continous viewing zone (cvz) will be observed for a substantially longer period, ap- proaching one year and , epochs at the ecliptic poles. these tess light curves will probe short period variability in great detail. asas sn provides long baseline ( yr) light curves sampled at a cadence of days, that complement the tess light curves. we extracted the asas sn light curves of million sources within deg of the southern ecliptic pole. these sources are within the southern tess cvz and will have well sampled tess light curves. in this work, we system- atically search this sample for variable sources. this is, in part, a test run for carrying out such a search over the entire sky. in section , we discuss the asas sn observations and data reduction procedures. section discusses the variabil- ity search and classication procedures. in section , we discuss our results and present a summary of our work in section all the light curves of these sources are made available to the public through our online database.

Variable stars, including pulsating variables and eclipsing binary stars, are utilized for distance measurements, studying stellar populations, and galactic structure. ASAS-SN monitors the sky for supernovae and other transients with a focus on bright sources, offering valuable data for variability studies. Recent research has reported new variables near the galactic plane and developed a variability classifier using ASAS-SN data.

       "  'Text': 'we started with the aavso photometric all sky survey (apass; henden et al. ) dr catalog as our input source catalog. we selected all the apass sources with v < mag in all the asas sn elds with central eld coordinates within deg from the southern ecliptic pole ( = deg, = deg). this resulted in a list of m sources spanning a total of , deg asas sn v band observations were made by thebrutus(haleakala, hawaii) and cassius (ctio, chile) quadruple telescopes between and each asas sn eld has - epochs of observation to a depth of v mag. each camera has a eld of view of deg, the pixel scale is and the fwhm is pixels. asas sn nominally saturates at mag, but light curves of saturated sources are sometimes quite good due to corrections made for bleed trails (see kochanek et al. ). the light curves for these sources were extracted as de- scribed in jayasinghe et al. (a) using image subtraction (alard & lupton ; alard ) and aperture photome- try on the subtracted images with a pixel radius aperture. the apass catalog was used for calibration. the zero point osets between the dierent cameras were corrected as de- scribed in jayasinghe et al. (a). figure illustrates the relationship between the mea- sured mean asas sn v band magnitudes and the apass dr v band magnitudes. sources with vmean mag have similar v band magnitudes, but a large fraction of the sources with vmean mag show a discrepancy between the asas sn and apass measurements. this is due to blend- ing in elds with signicant stellar densities (i.e., the lmc in this work). the relatively large asas sn pixel scale of as compared to the smaller apass pixel scale of makes asas sn photometry more susceptible to blending. thus, asas sn v band measurements are systematically brighter for most sources in the lmc due to blended light. the light curve extraction provides a statistical error estimate, but the scatter in the light curves of apparently non variable sources is generally larger than expected given the nominal statistical uncertainties. in jayasinghe et al.

() we can measure as the root mean square (rms) scatter in the light curves of non variable stars, and then subtract the estimated statistical errors to derive sys, with the results shown in figure for the m sources in our sample. for sources with vmean < mag, the photometric uncertainties approach an asas sn error oor of mag. for the sources with vmean > mag, we t a third order polynomial, log sys = a(x ) + b(x ) + c(x ) , () with a = , b = , and c = to the median of the sys versus vmean distribution. the polynomial smoothly joins to mag at v = mag. to correct the errors in the light curves, we replace the formal magnitude errors by using equation and either equation or mag for sys. we also identied a systematic issue that aects the light curves of certain sources due to malfunctioning shut- ters. the shutters in the asas sn cameras periodically start to fail. degraded shutters do not close completely, and stray light from neighboring bright sources can impart trails on the images during readout (figure ). this systematic is illustrated in the light curve for the non variable source j- (figure ). we see that after the mal- functioning shutter is replaced, the light curve returns to vmean log(sys) polynomial fit (n=) binned median: sys number of sources figure the distribution of sys for the m sources. the red points are the binned median values of sys for this sample in bins of mag. the blue curve shows a third order polynomial model for sources with v > mag (equation ). j- hjd- v magnitude figure top: examples of images that are aected by a malfunctioning shutter for the non variable source j- , with the reference image shown in the bottom right, bottom: the light curve for the source j- with the aected epochs highlighted by the red boxes. normal, but after days, the shutter begins to fail again. some fraction of our asas sn light curves will be aected by this systematic.

       "  'Text': 'we systematically searched for variable sources in a deg region surrounding the southern ecliptic pole. this region is coincident with the southern continuous view- ing zone for the tess satellite and thus, a large majority of these sources will have excellent tess light curves. through our search, we identied , variable sources, of which , are new discoveries. variable sources identied in the lmc largely consist of luminous variables, including cepheids, gcas variables (be stars) and red giants. we identify a broader sample of variables outside the lmc, including rr lyrae, eclipsing binaries, rotational variables and scuti variables. we have developed a user friendly interface to re- trieve pre computed asas sn v band light curves for apass sources. the v band light

       "  'Groundtruth': \"In this section, the authors conducted a systematic search for variable sources in a specific region near the southern ecliptic pole, coinciding with the Tess satellite's viewing zone. They identified a total of variable sources, including new discoveries. The variable sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) mostly consist of luminous variables such as Cepheids, Be stars, and red giants, while the broader sample outside the LMC includes RR Lyrae, eclipsing binaries, rotational variables, and Scuti variables. They developed a user-friendly interface to access pre-computed light curves for APASS sources and provide V band light curves for a large fraction of the sources in the Tess southern continuous viewing zone. The new variable sources have been added to various databases for access. Their ongoing effort aims to update the database with light curves for sources across the remainder of the sky. Acknowledgments and support for the project are also mentioned.\"}]"
