    "Text": "let g be the group of real points of a connected reductive algebraic group defined over r. given a maximal compact subgroup k, form the cartan motion group g0 attached to g and k: if g = k {circled plus}p is the cartan decomposition of the lie algebra of g, then g0 is the semidirect product k {left normal factor semidirect product}p. write e g for the tempered dual of g and c g0 for the unitary dual of g0. recent years have brought proof that the parameters necessary to describe e g and c g0 are identical: there is a natural, but non-trivial, one-to-one correspondence between e g and c g0 . we will refer to this correspondence as the mackey-higson bijection. when equipped with the fell topology, neither e g nor c g0 is usually hausdor {latin small ligature ff}. but it has been known for a while that the existence of a topologically well-behaved bijection between e g and c g0 could be of particular significance for certain aspects of representation theory, especially in relation with the study of group c*-algebras. alain connes and nigel higson pointed out in the late 1980s -long before the actual construction of the mackey-higson bijection -that the baum-connes-kasparov isomorphism for the k-theory of the reduced c*-algebra of g can be viewed as a statement that e g and c g0, although not homeomorphic, always have in a precise sense the same k-theory . the mackey-higson bijection does have pleasant topological properties: building on c*-algebraic methods due to nigel higson in the complex case, one of us showed in that the bijection is a piecewise homeomorphism. for real groups, the homeomorphic pieces are defined through david vogan's theory of lowest k-types. the pieces are stitched together di {latin small ligature ff}erently in both duals; but taking k-theory somehow blurs out that fact: the connes-kasparov isomorphism can actually be obtained in a rather elementary way from the topological properties of the mackey-higson bijection . in this short paper, we complete this topological information by proving that the mackey-higson bijection maps e g continuously onto c g0, although it is never a homeomorphism . together with the results of , we obtain the following picture for its topological properties: continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 2 theorem 1.1. {em dash} the mackey-higson bijection m : e g {rightwards arrow}c g0 is continuous, but m-1 is not continuous unless g and g0 are isomorphic. be the subset of e g consisting of those representations whose set of lowest k-types is exactly c. the bijection m induces a homeomorphism between e g and c g0. let us further comment on property . the construction of the mackey-higson bijection is easier to write down in the c g0 {rightwards arrow}e g direction; yet it is the reverse map, from e g to c g0, which turns out to be continuous. this is only natural given the link with noncommutative geometry, particularly the recent work of nigel higson and angel rom {latin small letter a with acute}n on reduced c*-algebras for complex groups . they proved the existence of a nontrivial continuous embedding c* r {rightwards arrow}c* r , and characterized the mackey bijection in terms of this embedding -in the particular case of complex groups, the existence of the embedding can be viewed as morally dual to our continuity result on the reduced duals. we should mention that most of the available information on the mackey bijection has been obtained through the existence of a continuous family tbelong to of groups interpolating between g and g0: see . by contrast, our method here is direct: we use the fine details of the algebraic construction in , together with various known results on the topology of representation spaces. the properties we shall need are essentially algebraic, often boiling down to a careful analysis of lowest k-types, and do not rely on deformation theory. our proof, in {section sign}4, will be obtained by focusing on the restriction of the mackey-higson bijection to each connected component of e g. the fell topology on e g has been known quite precisely since the 1980s , and the topology of c g0 has been described in 1968 ; we will use these descriptions and recall the necessary details in {section sign}2 and {section sign}3. we close this introduction with a few remarks on the possibility that analogues of properties and above may hold true for the admissible dual. consider the admissible duals {greek capital letter pi}adm and {greek capital letter pi}adm. the mackey-higson bijection extends to a bijection madm : {greek capital letter pi}adm {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter pi}adm: see . furthermore, both admissible duals are stratified according to lowest k-type theory. given a class {greek small letter sigma} belong to b k, we can consider the subsets {greek capital letter pi} {greek small letter sigma} {subset of} {greek capital letter pi}adm and {greek capital letter pi} {greek small letter sigma} {subset of} {greek capital letter pi}adm consisting of those representations that admit {greek small letter sigma} as a lowest k-type. these strata do not define a partition of the admissible duals, in contrast to the subsets e g of property : strata attached to di {latin small ligature ff}erent representations {greek small letter sigma} may intersect nontrivially. but each stratum is an a {latin small ligature ffi}ne algebraic variety , and the intersection of each stratum {greek capital letter pi}adm with the tempered dual e g is a finite disjoint union of subsets of the form e g. now, when g is a complex semisimple group, nigel higson proved in that for each {greek small letter sigma} belong to b k, the map madm : {greek capital letter pi}adm {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter pi}adm induces an isomorphism of algebraic varieties between {greek capital letter pi} {greek small letter sigma} and {greek capital letter pi} {greek small letter sigma}. eyal subag conjectured in that the same property holds for arbitrary g. he verified this in for g = sl using the algebraic framework of . in view of these results, it it tempting to wonder about the topological properties of the extension madm : {greek capital letter pi}adm {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter pi}adm, and to speculate that it may be continuous , but not a homeomorphism except in trivial cases. furthermore, it seems that subag's conjecture may be the final word on the algebraic analogue of property above. however, the fell topology on {greek capital letter pi}adm is more subtle than that of the tempered dual . because non-associated principal series representations can have a common subquotient, the connected components of {greek capital letter pi}adm cannot be described by simple results parallel to those of {section sign}2.2. therefore, extending our method to cover the case of the admissible duals would necessitate results on the fell continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 3 topology of {greek capital letter pi}adm which we have been unable to locate in the literature, or to prove ourselves. as a result, we shall remain entirely confined within the tempered duals here. acknowledgments. {em dash} we thank nigel higson for dissipating an early misconception about the topology of c g0, and maarten solleveld for correcting a mistake in the first version of proposition 3.2.",

we will write xu for the set of unramified unitary characters of l. let us now fix a discrete pair . the map {greek capital letter phi}l, {greek small letter sigma} : xu {rightwards arrow} {ohm sign}t {greek small letter chi} 7 {rightwards arrow}orbit of sends xu to a subset {greek capital letter theta}l, {greek small letter sigma} = {greek capital letter phi}l, {greek small letter sigma} ) of {ohm sign}t. inequivalent pairs map to disjoint subsets of {ohm sign}t. we write bt = { {greek capital letter theta}l, {greek small letter sigma}, belong to {ohm sign}t} for the set of blocks. suppose {greek small letter pi} is an irreducible tempered representation of g. then there exists a discrete pair and a parabolic subgroup p = ln of g with the property that {greek small letter pi} is equivalent with one of the irreducible factors of indg ln. the pair determines an element {greek capital letter theta}l, {greek small letter sigma} of bt which depends only on {greek small letter pi}, not on the choice of : we may and will call it the discrete support of {greek small letter pi}. for all this, original sources include ; a convenient reference is . for every block {greek capital letter theta} belong to bt, we write mt for the category of continuous nondegenerate c {star operator} r modules whose irreducible factors all have discrete support {greek capital letter theta}. harish-chandra's work induces a direct sum decomposition c {star operator} r = x {greek capital letter theta}belong to bt c {star operator} r {greek capital letter theta}, continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 4 where the spectrum of a given component c {star operator} r {greek capital letter theta} is e g {greek capital letter theta} = n {greek small letter pi} belong to e g whose discrete support is {greek capital letter theta} o ; see . this yields a partition e g = g {greek capital letter theta}belong to bt e g {greek capital letter theta} of the tempered dual into disjoint subsets, and a direct product decomposition mt = y {greek capital letter theta}belong to bt mt of the category of tempered representations. we refer to for the parallel with the non-archimedean case. 2.2. connected components of the tempered dual e g. {em dash} the following remark is important for what follows. although it is well-known , we will sketch a proof. proposition 2.1. {em dash} the connected components of e g are the e g {greek capital letter theta}, {greek capital letter theta} belong to bt. proof. {em dash} we note first that for every {greek capital letter theta}, the subset e g {greek capital letter theta} of e g is closed: the decomposition in identifies e g {greek capital letter theta} with the set of irreducible representations of c {star operator} r that vanish on the ideal j {greek capital letter theta} = p {greek capital letter theta} {prime} {combining long solidus overlay}= {greek capital letter theta} c {star operator} r {greek capital letter theta} {prime}. that is indeed a closed subset . we now check that each e g {greek capital letter theta} is connected. to that end, we will fix an element {greek small letter pi} {star operator}of e g {greek capital letter theta} and prove that every element in e g {greek capital letter theta} necessary lies in the same connected component of e g as {greek small letter pi} {star operator}. fix a component {greek capital letter theta} belong to bt. among the discrete pairs with equivalence class {greek capital letter theta}, there is one that has the additional property that if l = ma is the langlands decomposition of l , then the restriction {greek small letter sigma}|a is trivial. we will assume that our pair has that property. writing a for the lie algebra of a and a {star operator}for its vector space dual, recall that an element of a {star operator}is called a-regular when its scalar product with every positive root of is nonzero. fix a parabolic subgroup p = ln with levi factor l; this determines an ordering of a {star operator}. fix then an element {greek small letter nu} {star operator}in a {star operator}whose scalar product with every positive root of is positive , then define {greek small letter pi} {star operator}= indg p . since {greek small letter nu} {star operator}is a-regular, that representation is irreducible , and it lies in e g {greek capital letter theta}. for every representation {greek small letter pi} in e g {greek capital letter theta}, there exists an element {greek small letter nu} in a {star operator}which has the property that the scalar product of {greek small letter nu} with every positive root of is nonnegative and that {greek small letter pi} is equivalent with one of the irreducible constituents of indg p . for every t in , define {greek small letter nu}t = t {greek small letter nu} + {greek small letter nu} {star operator}and {greek small letter pi}t = indg p . for t > 0, the element {greek small letter nu}t is a-regular because it has a positive scalar product with every positive root of ; thus {greek small letter pi}t is irreducible for t > 0. using the compact picture for induced representations, together with the routine criteria for the continuity of parameter integrals, we can exhibit every matrix element of {greek small letter pi} as a limit fix a hilbert space v {greek small letter sigma} for {greek small letter sigma}; then for each t belong to , the representation {greek small letter pi}t can be realized on the hilbert space h = x1a f : k l2 {rightwards arrow}v {greek small letter sigma} : {for all}u belong to , f = {greek small letter sigma}f x1b . suppose {greek small letter xi} and {greek small letter eta} are elements of h; then the matrix element c {greek small letter xi}, {greek small letter eta} : g 7 {rightwards arrow} {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter xi}, {greek small letter pi}t {greek small letter eta} {mathematical right angle bracket}can be expressed using the iwasawa decomposition g = kman. if an element of g reads g = {greek small letter kappa} {micro sign}eh {greek small letter nu}, where , {micro sign}, h, {greek small letter nu}) belong to k * ) * a * n, then we have c {greek small letter xi}, {greek small letter eta} = r k e {mathematical left angle bracket}-i {greek small letter nu}t- {greek small letter rho}, h {mathematical right angle bracket}fdu, where f = {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter xi}, {greek small letter sigma}) {greek small letter eta} {mathematical right angle bracket}v {greek small letter sigma} and {greek small letter rho} is the usual half-sum of positive roots. see for instance . the claim easily follows. continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 5 uniform convergence on compact subset of g) of a family of matrix elements of t>0. this proves that {greek small letter pi} is in the closure of the family t>0, and thus {greek small letter pi} = {greek small letter pi}0 and {greek small letter pi} {star operator}= {greek small letter pi}1 must lie in the same connected component of e g. 2.3. vogan's lowest-k-type picture for the decomposition. {em dash} we now fix a maximal compact subgroup k in g and recall vogan's description of the blocks e g {greek capital letter theta} in terms of associate classes of lowest k-types . fix {greek capital letter theta} in e g {greek capital letter theta}. let be a discrete pair with equivalence class {greek capital letter theta} and the additional property that the restriction {greek small letter sigma}|a to the split component a of l is trivial . fix a parabolic subgroup p of g with levi factor l, then write c {greek capital letter theta} for the set of lowest k-types of the representation indg p . the notation is coherent, because all choices of with equivalence class {greek capital letter theta}, provided {greek small letter sigma} is trivial on the split component, lead to the same set of lowest k-types. proposition 2.2 . {em dash} let {greek small letter pi} be an irreducible tempered representation of g. then {greek small letter pi} lies in the component e g {greek capital letter theta} if and only if at least one of its lowest k-types lies in c {greek capital letter theta}. when that is the case, all the lowest k-types of {greek small letter pi} lie in c {greek capital letter theta}. see for connected g, and for a class of groups that includes the current one. 2.4. closure of a subset of e g. {em dash} we now formulate a version of the available results which yield a complete description of the topology of e g; let us mention contributions of delorme and mili {latin small letter c with caron}i {latin small letter c with acute} . notations 2.3. {em dash} fix a component e g {greek capital letter theta} in the tempered dual; assume e g {greek capital letter theta} is not a single point. consider : a discrete pair corresponding to {greek capital letter theta} ; l = ma : the langlands decomposition of l. we may and will assume that the restriction {greek small letter sigma}|a is trivial and will identify {greek small letter sigma} with its restriction to m . p = man : a parabolic subgroup with levi factor l {increment}+ : the positive root system for that corresponds to n ; a+ = x08 {greek small letter nu} belong to a {star operator}, {for all} {greek small letter alpha} belong to {increment}+, {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter alpha}, {greek small letter nu} {mathematical right angle bracket} {greater-than or equal to}0 t . it is a closed cone in a {star operator}. a {star operator}/w = the quotient of a {star operator}by the weyl group w = w. every class in a {star operator}/w has a finite number of representatives in a+. for every irreducible tempered representation {greek small letter pi} in the component e g {greek capital letter theta}, there is a unique {greek small letter nu} = {greek small letter nu} in a {star operator}/w with the property that {greek small letter pi} occurs in indg p . proposition 2.4. {em dash} suppose b is a subset of e g {greek capital letter theta}. form the set v = { {greek small letter nu}, {greek small letter pi} belong to b} of continuous parameters for representations in b, and its closure {macron} v in a {star operator}/w. the closure of b in e g consists of those representations {greek small letter pi} that belong to e g {greek capital letter theta} and satisfy {greek small letter nu} belong to {macron} v. proof. {em dash} combine or with the information on connected components from {section sign}2.2. continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 6 to obtain the closure of b in e g, we can thus form the set of representations indg p for {greek small letter chi} in the closure of the set of continuous parameters for members of b, then consider all irreducible factors in these. example 2.5. {em dash} suppose g = sl, man is the upper triangular subgroup , and {greek small letter sigma} is the one non-trivial representation of m. the discrete pair determines a component {greek capital letter theta} in e g. we can identify the unitary unramified characters of ma with the unitary characters of a. now, consider the set b of representations of the form indg man, where {greek small letter chi} is a non-trivial unitary character of a. all representations in b are irreducible and tempered. to obtain the closure of b in e g, we need to add to b the two limits of discrete series whose direct sum is the representation indg man. we shall need a consequence of the above results, taken from , that says what happens when one considers the continuous parameters for a convergent sequence of irreducible tempered representations. corollary 2.6. {em dash} suppose {greek small letter pi} is an irreducible tempered representation of g in the component e g {greek capital letter theta}, and nbelong to n is a sequence of irreducible tempered representations that admits {greek small letter pi} as a limit point. there exists a subsequence jbelong to n of representations that all lie in e g {greek capital letter theta} and have the property that as j goes to infinity, {greek small letter nu} goes to {greek small letter nu} in a {star operator}/w.",

    "Text": "3.1. mackey parameters for c g0 and e g. {em dash} suppose {greek small letter sigma} is a unitary irreducible representation of the motion group g0 = k {left normal factor semidirect product}p of {section sign}1. given a pair in which {greek small letter chi} is an element of p {star operator}and {micro sign} is an irreducible representation of the stabilizer k {greek small letter chi} of {greek small letter chi} in k, we shall say that is a mackey parameter for {greek small letter sigma} when {greek small letter sigma} is equivalent, as a representation of g0, with indg0 k {greek small letter chi} {left normal factor semidirect product}p. every unitary irreducible representation {greek small letter sigma} of g0 admits at least one mackey parameter, and two di {latin small ligature ff}erent mackey parameters for a given {greek small letter sigma} must be conjugate under k. it is perhaps a bit less natural to write down the definition of the mackey-higson bijection m : e g {rightwards arrow} c g0 rather than that of its inverse, as in ; yet the information we shall need can be phrased as follows. if {greek small letter pi} is an irreducible tempered representation of the reductive group g, we will say that is a mackey parameter for {greek small letter pi} when it is a mackey parameter for the representation m of g0. crucial to the next statement are the notion of tempered representation with real infinitesimal character , and, when a is the split component of a levi subgroup of g, the notion of a-regular element in a {star operator}. lemma 3.1. {em dash} let {greek small letter pi} be an irreducible tempered representation of g. the pair is a mackey parameter for {greek small letter pi} if and only there is an equivalence {greek small letter pi} {asymptotically equal to}indg p x00 {greek small letter sigma} {circled times}ei {greek small letter chi}x01 , where the data satisfy the following conditions: {bullet} p = ln = man is a parabolic subgroup of g, {bullet} {greek small letter chi} is an a-regular element of a {star operator}, {bullet} {greek small letter sigma} is a tempered representation of l that has real infinitesimal character and whose restriction to k {intersection}l = k {greek small letter chi} admits {micro sign} as its lowest -type. continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 7 the above statement depends on the fact k {intersection}l = k {greek small letter chi} whenever {greek small letter chi} is a-regular, and on a theorem of vogan that says that given l and {micro sign} belong to k {intersection}l, there exists a {greek small letter sigma} belong to e l that satisfies the condition in the theorem. the fact that the statement is correct is a reformulation of parts of the construction of the correspondence in . 3.2. discontinuity of m-1 : c g0 {rightwards arrow}e g. {em dash} before we consider the topology of c g0 in more detail, let us remark that we already know enough about e g to verify that the mackey bijection cannot be a homeomorphism. proposition 3.2. {em dash} the bijection m-1 : c g0 {rightwards arrow}e g is never continuous, unless g and g0 are isomorphic. an isomorphism between g and g0 exists if and only if g is a direct product of a compact group and an abelian vector group, in other words when the derived group of g is compact. when g and g0 are not isomorphic, we shall see, for instance, that the trivial representation of g0 is always a discontinuity point of m-1. proof. {em dash} suppose g and g0 are not isomorphic. choose a regular element {greek small letter chi} in p {star operator}. consider the induced representation {greek small letter sigma} = indg0 m {left normal factor semidirect product}p, where m = zk is the centralizer of {greek small letter chi} in p {star operator}. for every {greek small letter alpha} > 0, let us consider the representation {greek small letter sigma} {greek small letter alpha} = indg0 m {left normal factor semidirect product}p, and observe what happens as {greek small letter alpha} goes to infinity. if b km is the set of those {greek small letter lamda} belong to b k that occur in l2, and if we identify the elements of b km with representations of g0 in which p acts trivially, then we will check that b = { {greek small letter sigma} {greek small letter alpha}, {greek small letter alpha} belong to , who works with the more general setting of a semidirect product h {left normal factor semidirect product}n where h is a compact group and n a locally compact abelian group. his main result does not look exactly like the above: there is the anecdotal point that he needs to use nets rather than sequences, and the more serious fact that he calls in a topology on the set a of pairs , where j is a closed subgroup of h and {greek small letter tau} is an irreducible representation of j. to see how this translates into theorem 3.3 in our case, let us first give a statement closer in spirit to . for the cartan motion group g0 = k {left normal factor semidirect product}p, using the notations of theorem 3.3, baggett proves that {greek small letter sigma} {infinity}is a limit point of nbelong to n if and only if there is a subsequence jbelong to n such that: as j goes to infinity, {greek small letter chi}nj goes to {greek small letter chi} {infinity}; goes, in the fell space a, to a pair where klim is a subgroup of k {greek small letter chi} {infinity}, the induced representation indk {greek small letter chi} {infinity} klim contains {micro sign} {infinity}. if we fix a minimal parabolic subgroup pmin = mminaminnmin, we can choose the mackey parameters in such a way that {greek small letter chi}n always belongs to the closed weyl chamber a+ min that comes with pmin. but then, since there is only a finite number of subgroups of k that can arise as the stabilizer of some {greek small letter chi} in a+ min, there is only a finite number of subgroups that can arise as k {greek small letter chi}n for some n. in baggett's statement above, we can thus replace with the sequence x10 x11 jbelong to n is eventually constant and k {greek small letter chi}nj is actually a subgroup of k {greek small letter chi} {infinity}. this leads to the statement in theorem 3.3.",

nbelong to n is a sequence of irreducible tempered representations of g that admits {greek small letter pi} {infinity}as a limit point, then there exists a subsequence of nbelong to n whose image under m admits m as a limit point. 4.1. preliminaries on the reductive side. {em dash} write e g {greek capital letter theta} for the connected component of e g that contains {greek small letter pi} {infinity}. there is a subsequence of nbelong to n whose terms all lie in e g {greek capital letter theta}; since we will have a handful of successive extractions to do hereafter, we will replace nbelong to n by such a subsequence without changing the notation. we now take up the setting of notations 2.3 and consider a parabolic subgroup ln, a discrete series representation {greek small letter sigma} of l, and parameters kbelong to n {union}{ {infinity}} in a+, in such a way that {greek small letter pi} {infinity}occurs in indg ln and for each n, {greek small letter pi}n occurs in indg ln. by corollary 2.6, after passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that {greek small letter nu} goes to {greek small letter nu} in b a/w. since the weyl group w is finite and {greek small

{infinity}in a+. 4.1.1. strata in the weyl chamber. {em dash} for each n in n {union}{ {infinity}}, let us consider sn = x08 {greek small letter alpha} belong to {increment}+ : {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter alpha}, {greek small letter nu}n {mathematical right angle bracket}> 0 t . that subset of {increment}+ keeps track of the a-regularity of {greek small letter nu}n: when sn = {empty set}we have {greek small letter nu}n = 0, whereas sn = {increment}+ if and only if {greek small letter nu}n is a-regular. observation 4.2. {em dash} suppose {greek capital letter sigma} is a subset of {increment}+. if {n belong to n : sn = {greek capital letter sigma}} is infinite, then {greek capital letter sigma} contains s {infinity}. this is because when {greek small

0, so that eventually {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter alpha}, {greek small letter nu}n {mathematical right angle bracket}> 0 and {greek small letter alpha} belong to sn. let us now fix a subset {greek capital letter sigma} {subset of} {increment}+ such that {n belong to n : sn = {greek capital letter sigma}} is infinite. after passing again to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that sn = {greek capital letter sigma} for all n. we now observe that the centralizer l {greek small letter nu}n = zg of {greek small letter nu}n in g does not depend on n. see for instance the details on the construction of the centralizer given in : if lmin = mminamin is a minimal levi subgroup of g contained in l, then l {greek small letter nu}n is generated by mmin and the root subgroups for roots {greek small letter alpha} that lie in sn = {greek capital letter sigma}. these do not depend on n. we will henceforth write lseq for the common centralizer of all {greek small

and a {infinity}denote the split components of lseq and l {infinity}, then a {infinity} {subset of}aseq {subset of}a. we remark, following the proof of , that l is in fact a levi subgroup in the reductive group lseq, and that lseq is itself a levi subgroup of l {infinity}. with apologies for the clumsy notation, let us write e n for a subgroup of lseq such that l e n is a parabolic subgroup of lseq with levi factor l, and nseq for a subgroup of l {infinity}such that lseqnseq is a parabolic subgroup of l {infinity}with levi factor lseq. we will also need the maximal compact subgroups kseq = k {intersection}lseq and k {infinity}= k {intersection}l {infinity}. 4.1.2. mackey parameters. {em dash} the above observations make it easy to pin down the mackey parameters for each of the {greek small letter pi}ns that remain at this stage . recall from vogan's work that for every irreducible representation {micro sign} of kseq, there exists a unique irreducible tempered representation of lseq that has real infinitesimal character and lowest kseq-type {micro sign} . write vlseq for that representation. the kseq-type {micro sign} is the unique lowest kseq-type of vlseq. lemma 4.3. {em

occurs in indg ln and remark, as in the proof of , that if lseqn {prime} is a parabolic subgroup of g with levi factor lseq, then indg ln {asymptotically equal to}indg lseq x10 indlseq l e n {circled times}ei {greek small letter nu}nx11 . for the coadjoint action, where we view {greek small letter nu}n belong to a {star operator}as an element of g {star operator}. continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 10 the representation {combining plus sign below} = indlseq l e n is tempered, has real infinitesimal character and a finite number of irreducible components. since {greek small letter nu}n is aseq-regular, for every irreducible component {greek small letter tau} of {combining plus sign below}, the representation indg lseqn is in fact irreducible . furthermore, its lowest k-types are entirely determined by {greek small letter tau}. thus, the lowest k-types of {greek small letter pi}n make it possible to pin down the one irreducible constituent {greek small letter tau}n for which {greek small letter pi}n {asymptotically equal to}indg lseqn. writing {micro sign}n for the unique lowest kseq-type of {greek small letter tau}n, we obtain {greek small letter tau}n {asymptotically equal to}vlseq, as desired. in the above statement, {micro sign}n may depend on n; but it determines the set of lowest k-types of {greek small letter pi}n, which is a subset of the class c {greek capital letter theta} described in {section sign}2.2, and di {latin small ligature ff}erent values for {micro sign}n lead to di {latin small ligature ff}erent sets of lowest k-types . so there are only a finite number of possibilities for the element {micro sign}n in d kseq. after a new extraction, we obtain the following result: lemma 4.4. {em dash} there exists a subsequence jbelong to n of nbelong to n with the property that {micro sign}nj does not depend on j, so that there exists {micro sign}seq belong to d kseq such that: {for all}j belong to n, {greek small letter pi}nj {asymptotically equal to}indg pseq x00vlseq {circled times}ei {greek small letter nu}nx01 . if we replace nbelong to n by the above subsequence and take up the notations of {section sign}3.1, we now know from lemma 3.1 that for each n, a mackey parameter for {greek small letter pi}n is . 4.1.3. remark on the lowest k-types of {greek small letter pi} {infinity}. {em dash} at this stage, since each {greek small letter nu}n is aseq-regular, we know that the set of lowest k-types of {greek small letter pi}n does not depend on n: it is determined by the pair . example 2.5 shows that {greek small letter pi} {infinity}does not necessarily have the exact same set of lowest k-types as the {greek small letter pi}ns: if g = sl and {greek small letter pi} {infinity}is a limit of discrete series, then {greek small letter pi} {infinity}has a unique lowest so-type, but {greek small letter pi} {infinity}is a limit point of the nonspherical principal series, which consists of representations having two distinct lowest so-types . lemma 4.5. {em dash} suppose cseq {subset of}b k is the set of lowest k-types common to all {greek small letter pi}n, n belong to n. then the set of lowest k-types of {greek small letter pi} {infinity}is contained in cseq. proof. {em dash} we first recall that if {greek small letter lamda} is a class in b k and {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter lamda} : k {rightwards arrow}c is its character, there is a simple criterion for ascertaining that an irreducible tempered representation {greek small letter pi} of g does not contain {greek small letter lamda} upon restriction to k: one needs only check that for every matrix element c : g {rightwards arrow}c of {greek small letter pi}, the convolution product {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter lamda} {star operator} x00c|k x01 vanishes. we also recall that the partial ordering on b k used to define the notion of lowest k-type can be built from a positive-valued function {parallel to} {middle dot} {parallel to}b k on b k. all classes {greek small letter lamda} in cseq have the same norm {parallel to} {greek small letter lamda} {parallel to}b k ; write {parallel to}cseq {parallel to}b k for the common value. consider then {bullet} a k-type {greek small letter lamda} such that {parallel to} {greek small letter lamda} {parallel to}b k {less-than or equal to} {parallel to}cseq {parallel to}b k, but which does not belong to cseq, {bullet} and a matrix element c of {greek small letter pi} {infinity}; let us inspect the convolution {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter lamda} {star operator} x00c|k x01 . by definition of the fell topology, there exists a sequence nbelong to n of complex-valued functions on g, in which each map cn is a matrix element of {greek small letter pi}n, and which as n goes to infinity goes to c uniformly on compact subsets of g. since the k-type {greek small letter lamda} appears in none of the {greek small letter pi}n, we have {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter lamda} {star operator} x00|k x01 = 0 for each n. but |k)nbelong to n goes to c|k uniformly on k; so {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter lamda} {star operator} x00|k x01 does pointwise converge to the {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter lamda} {star operator} x00c|k x01 . thus the latter function must be zero. we conclude that a k-type whose norm does not exceed {parallel to}cseq {parallel to}b k can appear in {greek small letter pi} {infinity}only if it belongs to cseq. besides, {greek small letter pi} {infinity}lies in e g {greek capital letter theta}, so we already know that its lowest k-types all have norm {parallel to}cseq {parallel to}b k; this proves the lemma. this is the convolution product over k: the function k 7 {rightwards arrow} r k {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter lamda}cdu from k to c. continuity of the mackey-higson bijection 11 4.2. verification of baggett's criterion. {em dash} we can now prove that m is a limit point of )nbelong to n in the unitary dual c g0. in {section sign}4.1.2, we showed that a mackey parameter for {greek small letter pi}n is -recall that in the present context, the centralizer of {greek small letter nu}n in k is equal to kseq . by the argument already used for lemma 4.3, we also know that there exists a parabolic subgroup p {infinity}with levi factor l {infinity}, and an irreducible representation {micro sign} {infinity}belong to d k {infinity}, such that {greek small letter pi} {infinity}is equivalent with the irreducible representation indg p {infinity} {circled times}ei {greek small letter nu} {infinity}); the representation {greek small letter pi} {infinity}then admits as a mackey parameter. given baggett's criterion 3.3, to complete the proof of theorem 4.1, we need only verify the following fact: lemma 4.6. {em dash} the representation {micro sign} {infinity}of k {infinity}is contained in indk {infinity} kseq. proof. {em dash} suppose the lemma is false. let us induce to k and compare the k-modules indk k {infinity} and indk k {infinity} x10 indk {infinity} kseq x11 {asymptotically equal to}indk kseq; more precisely, let us inspect their lowest k-types. if {small tilde} {micro sign} is an irreducible representation of k {infinity}that appears in indk {infinity} kseq, then under our assumption that the lemma is false, we have {micro sign} {infinity} {combining long solidus overlay}= {small tilde} {micro sign}; but in that situation, we know that the representations indk k {infinity} and indk k {infinity} have no lowest k-type in common. the second k-module in is a direct sum of k-modules that each read indk k {infinity} for some {small tilde} {micro sign} {combining long solidus overlay}= {micro sign} {infinity}; so the two k-modules to be compared in actually have no lowest k-type in common. to see that this is impossible, we only have to point out that the two k-modules in are the restrictions to k of {greek small letter pi} {infinity}and {greek small letter pi}n . lemma 4.5 shows that each lowest k-type in {greek small letter pi} {infinity} is also a lowest k-type in {greek small letter pi}n, so the set of lowest k-types of the first module of is contained in the set of lowest k-types of the second. the lemma follows.",

        "Text": "for neutrino energies beyond some 100 gev, the detectors discussed in the previous subsection lack sensitivity, simply because the target volume is too small to yield su {latin small ligature ffi}cient event rates and also because events at such energies are too large to be contained in the detector volume. in order to access this high-energy regime, in particular for the purpose of neutrino astronomy, instrumented volumes of at least several 10 mtons, better gtons are required. they are constructed by deploying arrays of vertical structures carrying pmts to the deep ice of the south pole or the deep water of the mediterranean sea or the lake baikal. the water/ice layer above the sensors completely shields the daylight. the pmts are included in pressureresistant glass spheres which also house the voltage supplies, the front-end electronics and calibration instruments . the strings are connected to surface/shore by cables for data transport, operation control and electrical power supply. particle-induced events from neutrinos or atmospheric muons are recognised and reconstructed using the space-time pattern of cherenkov photons recorded by the optical modules. see for more details. figure 7: schematic of the icecube detector. picture provided by the icecube collaboration. the main science objectives of these neutrino telescopes include neutrino astronomy ; multi-messenger astronomy ; the indirect search for dark matter; neutrino and other particle physics , the search for phenomena beyond the standard model of particle physics . note that the universe is transparent to neutrinos of all energies, whereas the reach of electromagnetic radiation is severely constrained for energies exceeding some 10 tev due to gamma-ray interaction with ubiquitous radiation fields. the currently most sensitive high-energy neutrino telescope is icecube at the south pole, operational in full configuration since 2010. it consists of 86 strings carrying altogether 5160 downward-looking 10-inch pmts instrumenting one cubic kilometre of ice at a depth between 1450 m and 2450 m. a sub-volume is instrumented more densely than the rest to detect neutrinos with energies down to 10 gev . the icetop cherenkov surface array serves for cosmic-ray studies and also provides some veto capability against muons and neutrinos from air showers. an in-ice hardware trigger requires hits in adjacent pmts within 1 {micro sign}s. a schematic of icecube is shown in fig. 7. the angular resolution for {greek small letter nu} {micro sign} chargedcurrent events above some tev is a few tenths of a degree; cascade events resulting from reactions of other neutrino flavours or neutral-current interactions are reconstructed with a resolution of about 10-15 {white bullet}. main systematics come from the inhomogeneity of the optical ice properties and from light scattering, which blurs the space-time pattern of cherenkov photons. icecube has achieved two major breakthrough results: the first identification and flux measurement of high-energy cosmic 5 neutrinos and the first association of high-energy neutrinos to an astrophysical object, the blazar txs 0506.056 . this detection became possible by relating an icecube neutrino alert with electromagnetic observations, and was confirmed by archival icecube data. see for these and further icecube results. the icecube detector will be further developed and extended. as a first step, 7 additional strings with newly developed optical modules and calibration devices will be added to the deep core region. this project has currently been approved by the us national science foundation , and deployment is expected in 2022/23. the main objectives are a better understanding of the ice properties, entailing a reduction of the systematic uncertainties; improved investigation of neutrinos in the few-gev range; test of new hardware developments. as a next step, icecube-gen2 with a 10 km3 deep-ice detector, a high-density core for low-energy neutrinos , a large cosmic-ray and veto surface array, and a radio detection array is planned. if all works well, icecube-gen2 could be installed 2025-2031. see for details. complementing icecube in the field of view and in the major systematic uncertainties, the antares neutrino telescope in the mediterranean sea o {latin small ligature ff}the french shore near toulon is operational in full configuration since 2008. it consists of 12 strings carrying 25 storeys with three 10-inch pmts each, downward-looking at an angle if 45 {white bullet}to vertical. the strings are connected to a junction box on the sea bed and from there by an electro-optical cable to shore. all pmt hits exceeding a signal height corresponding to 0.3 photo-electrons are read out and sent to shore, where the data are filtered by an online computer cluster. antares instruments a water volume of about 0.015 km3 and is thus intrinsically significantly less sensitive than icecube. angular resolutions for {greek small letter nu} {micro sign} charged-current and for cascade events with neutrino energies exceeding 10 tev are better than 0.4 {white bullet}and 2-3 {white bullet}, respectively. main instrumental systematics are due to the inhomogeneity of detector and deep-sea environment in time, and due to background light from bioluminescence. in spite of its limited size, antares has provided a number of important results, in particular also in common analyses with icecube, which evidence the importance of full sky coverage for each neutrino flavour and energy. see for a selection of important antares results. antares has proven the feasibility of deep-sea neutrino detection and has paved the way towards the next-generation neutrino telescope in the mediterranean sea, km3net . the km3net 2.0 detector will consist of two installations, arca1 o {latin small ligature ff}the eastern sicilian shore and orca2 close to the antares site. arca will encompass two building blocks with 115 strings each, where each string carries 18 optical modules; the overall instrumented volume will be 1 km3. the prime objective of arca is neutrino astronomy in an energy range beyond a few tev. due to its larger size and improved detector technology , the angular resolutions in km3net 1astroparticle research with cosmics in the abyss 2oscillation research with cosmics in the abyss figure 8: photograph of a km3net digital optical module during assembly/testing. picture provided by the km3net collaboration. will be better than in antares . orca will use the same basic detector technology as arca, but be much more densely instrumented . orca will focus on neutrino oscillation physics with atmospheric neutrinos in the energy range of a few gev to a few 10 gev, and in particular on measuring the neutrino mass ordering. an option to investigate cp violation by directing a neutrino beam from protvino to orca is under discussion. a number of new technical developments has been achieved for km3net that improve functionality, cost-e {latin small ligature ff}ectiveness, risk mitigation and construction time. amongst them are equipressure vertical cables , a new deployment strategy , and a multi-pmt digital optical module . the advantages of the latter are increased photocathode area per glass sphere at reduced overall pmt cost; reduced risk due to less feed-through holes in the glass spheres; better photon-counting; angular information; almost isotropic sensitivity. the construction of both km3net detectors has begun and is expected to be completed 2021/22. a further extension with four more arca blocks is envisioned but not yet negotiated. see for expected km3net sensitivities, in particular to a di {latin small ligature ff}use cosmic neutrino flux as observed by icecube and to the neutrino mass ordering. a third large neutrino telescope, the gigaton volume detector , is currently under construction in lake baikal, russia. it will consist of 8-string clusters with a diameter of 120 m and a height of 525 m; the depth at the installation site is 1360 m. each string carries 36 optical modules equipped with 10-inch, downward-looking pmts. in a first phase, 8 clusters will be deployed to instrument 0.4 km3 of water; the final goal are 27 clusters covering a volume of 1.5 km3. currently three clusters are operational, and two more are to be deployed per year. first results from gvd have been reported at the neutrino conference 2018 . 6",

    "Text": "rank aggregation is an important task that arises in a wide-range of applications, including recommender systems, information retrieval, online gaming, sport competitions, and evaluation of machine learning algorithms. given a set of items, the goal is to infer ranking scores of items or an ordering of items based on observed data that contains partial orderings of items. a common scenario is that of paired comparisons, e.g, player a defeats player b in a game, product a is preferred over product b by a user, and machine learning algorithm a outperforms machine learning algorithm b in an evaluation. in such scenarios, a common goal is not only to compute an aggregate ranking of items, but also to compute ranking scores, which represent strengths of individual items. such ranking scores are used for predicting outcomes of future ranking outcomes, such as predicting outcomes of matches in online games and sport contests, and predicting preference of users in product shopping or movie watching scenarios, among 1 arxiv:1901.00150v3 26 dec 2020 vojnovic, yun and zhou: accelerated mm algorithms for ranking scores inference from comparison data 2 others. note that, importantly, observations are not restricted to paired comparisons, but may also include other types of comparison data, such as choice or full ranking . in this paper, our goals are to shed light on the efficiency of one of the most popular iterative optimization methods for inference of ranking scores, namely the mm algorithm, where ranking scores correspond to parameter estimates of popular bradley-terry family of models, and to propose an accelerated mm algorithm that resolves a slow convergence issue found to hold for a classic mm algorithm. related work statistical models of ranking data play an important role in a wide range of applications, including learning to rank in information retrieval , li ), skill rating in sport games ), online gaming platforms ), and evaluation of machine learning algorithms by comparing them with each other ). a common class of statistical models of ranking data are generalized bradley-terry models, which accommodate paired comparisons with win-lose outcomes , bradley and terry , bradley ), paired comparisons with win-lose-draw outcomes ), choices from comparison sets of two or more items, e.g, luce choice model ), full ranking outcomes for comparison sets of two or more items, e.g, plackett-luce ranking model ), as well as group comparisons ). these models can be derived from suitably defined latent variable models, where items are associated with independent latent performance random variables, which is in the spirit of the wellknown thurstone model of comparative judgment ). an iterative optimization algorithm for the maximum likelihood parameter estimation of the bradley-terry model has been known since the original work of zermelo . lange et al. showed that this algorithm belongs to the class of mm optimization algorithms. here mm refers to either minorize-maximization or majorizeminimization, depending on whether the optimization problem is maximization or minimization of an objective function. lange provided a book on mm algorithms and hunter and lange provided a tutorial. mairal established some convergence results for incremental mm algorithms. in a seminal paper, hunter derived mm algorithms for generalized bradley-terry models as well as sufficient conditions for their convergence to ml estimators using the framework of mm optimization algorithms. for the bradley-terry model of paired comparisons, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a ml estimator is that the directed graph whose vertices correspond to items and edges represent outcomes of paired comparisons is connected. in other words, the set of items cannot be partitioned in two sets such that none of the items in one partition won against an item in other partition. a bayesian inference method for generalized bradley-terry models was proposed by caron and doucet , showing that classical mm algorithms can be reinterpreted as special instances of expectation-maximization algorithms associated with suitably defined latent variables and proposed some original extensions. this amounts to mm algorithms for maximum a posteriori probability parameter estimation, for a specific family of prior distributions. this prior distribution is a product-form distribution with gamma marginal distributions, where {greek small letter alpha} {greater-than or equal to}1 is the shape parameter and beta > 0 is the rate parameter. importantly, unlike to the ml estimation, the map estimate is always guaranteed to exist, for any given observation data. algorithms for fitting bradley-terry model parameters are implemented in open source software packages, including bradleyterry2 ), bradleyterryscalable ), and choix ). the first package uses a fisher scoring algorithm , while the latter two use mm algorithms . first-order methods are generally vojnovic, yun and zhou: accelerated mm algorithms for ranking scores inference from comparison data 3 preferred over second-order methods for fitting high-dimensional models using large training datasets. while the conditions for convergence of mm algorithms for generalized bradley-terry models are well understood, to the best of our knowledge, not much is known about their convergence rates for either ml or map estimation. in this paper, we close this gap by providing tight characterizations of convergence rates. our results identify key properties of input data that determine the convergence rate, and in the case of map estimation, how the convergence rate depends on prior distribution parameters. our results show that mm algorithms, commonly used for map estimation for generalized bradley-terry models, can have a slow convergence for some prior distributions. recent research on statistical models of paired comparisons focused on characterization of the accuracy of parameter estimators and development of new, scalable parameter estimation methods, e.g, guiver and snelson , wauthier et al. , hajek et al. , rajkumar and agarwal , chen and suh , shah et al. , vojnovic and yun , khetan and oh , negahban et al. , borkar et al. , chen et al. . note that the question about statistical estimation accuracy and computation complexity tradeoff is out of the scope of our paper, and this was studied in the above cited papers. the focus of our work is on convergence properties of first-order iterative optimization methods for parameter estimation of bradleyterry models. here first-order refers to optimization methods that are restricted to value oracle access to gradients of the optimization objective function, thus not allowing access to second-order properties such as values of the hessian matrix. specifically, we are interested in convergence properties of first-order methods for ml and map estimation objectives. it is noteworthy that some recently proposed algorithms show empirically faster convergence rate than mm, e.g, negahban et al. , maystre and grossglauser , agarwal et al. , but it is hard to apply them for the map estimation objective. we thus restrict our attention to mm and gradient descent algorithms which are able to solve both mle and map optimization problems. a preliminary version of our paper was published in vojnovic et al. , which contains results on convergence rates of gradient descent and mm algorithms . in the present paper, we extend our prior work by proposing new accelerated algorithms and establishing their theoretical guarantees as well as demonstrating their efficiency through numerical evaluations . summary of our contributions we present tight characterizations of the rate of convergence of gradient descent and mm algorithms for ml and map estimation for generalized bradley-terry models. our results show that both gradient descent and mm algorithms have linear convergence with convergence rates differing only in constant factors. an iterative optimization algorithm that has linear convergence is generally considered to be fast in the space of first-order optimization algorithms, and many first-order algorithms cannot guarantee a linear convergence. for example, standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm is known to have sub-linear convergence, see, e.g, bubeck . we provide explicit bounds on convergence rates that provide insights into which properties of observed comparison data play a key role for the rate of convergence. specifically, we show that the rate of convergence critically depends on certain properties of the matrix of item pair co-occurrences, m, of input comparison data. we found that two key properties are: maximum number of paired comparisons per item ) and the algebraic connectivity of matrix m ). intuitively, a quantifies how well is the graph of paired comparisons connected. here a is the fiedler value , cf. fiedler , defined as the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix lm = dm -m, where dm is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to the row sums of m. the fiedler value of a matrix of paired comparison counts is known to play a key role in determining the mle accuracy, e.g, hajek et al. , shah et al. , khetan and oh , vojnovic and yun , negahban et al. . these works characterized the number of samples vojnovic, yun and zhou: accelerated mm algorithms for ranking scores inference from comparison data 4 needed to estimate the true parameter vector within a statistical estimation error tolerance. this is different from the problem of characterizing the number of iterations needed for an iterative optimization algorithm to compute a ml or a map parameter estimate satisfying an error tolerance condition, which is studied in this paper. our results reveal the following facts about convergence time, defined as the number of iterations that an iterative optimization algorithm takes to reach the value of the underlying objective function within a given error tolerance parameter {greek lunate epsilon symbol} > 0 of the optimum value. for the ml objective, we show that the convergence time satisfies tml = o x12d a log x121 {greek lunate epsilon symbol} x13x13 which reveals that the rate of convergence critically depends on the connectivity of the graph of paired comparisons in observed data. for the map estimation, we show that the convergence time satisfies tmap = o x12x12d beta + 1 x13 log x121 {greek lunate epsilon symbol} x13x13 where, recall, beta > 0 is the rate parameter of the gamma prior distribution. this bound is shown to be tight for some input data instances. we observe that the convergence time for the map estimation problem can be arbitrarily large for small enough parameter beta, where small values of parameter beta correspond to less informative prior distributions. our results identify a slow rate of convergence issue for gradient descent and mm algorithms for the map estimation problem. while the map estimation alleviates the issue of the non-existence of a ml estimator when the graph of paired comparisons is disconnected, it can have a much slower convergence than ml when the graph of paired comparisons is connected. perhaps surprisingly, the rate of convergence has a discontinuity at beta = 0, in the sense that for {greek small letter alpha} = 1 and beta = 0, the mm algorithm for the map estimation corresponds to the classic mm algorithm for ml estimation, and in this case, the convergence bound holds, while for the map estimation, the convergence time grows arbitrarily large as beta approaches 0 from above. we propose an acceleration method for the map estimation objective, with convergence time bounded as follows tmap acc = o x12 min x1ad a, d beta x1b log x121 {greek lunate epsilon symbol} x13x13 . this acceleration method resolves the slow convergence issue of classic mm algorithm for the map estimation for generalized bradleyterry models. this accelerated method does not have a discontinuity at beta = 0 with respect to the rate of convergence: as beta approaches 0 from above, the convergence time bound corresponds to that of the mm algorithm for ml estimation. the acceleration method normalizes the parameter vector estimate in each iteration of the gradient descent or mm algorithm using a particular normalization that ensures that the value of the objective function is non decreasing along the sequence of estimated parameter vectors and that the objective function satisfies certain smoothness and strong convexity properties that ensure high convergence rate. this amounts to a slight modification of the classical mm algorithm that resolves the identified convergence issue. this acceleration method is derived by using a theoretical framework that may be of general interest. this framework can be applied to different statistical models of ranking data and prior distributions for bayesian inference of parameters of these models. we present numerical evaluation of the convergence time of different iterative optimization algorithms using input data comparisons from a collection of real-world datasets. these results demonstrate the extent of the slow convergence issue of the existing mm algorithm for map estimation and show significant speed ups achieved by our accelerated mm algorithm. our theoretical results are established by using the framework of convex optimization analysis and spectral theory of matrices. in particular, the convergence rate bounds are obtained by using concepts of smooth and strongly convex functions. we derive accelerated iterative optimization algorithms based vojnovic, yun and zhou: accelerated mm algorithms for ranking scores inference from comparison data 5 on a general approach that may be of independent interest. this approach transforms the parameter estimator in each iteration so that certain conditions are preserved for the gradient vector and the hessian matrix of the objective function. for generalized bradley-terry models, this transformation turns out to be simple, yielding a practical algorithm. organization of the paper in section 2, we present problem formulation and some background material. section 3 contains our main results on characterization of convergence rates of gradient descent and mm algorithms; for simplicity of exposition, we focus only on the bradley-terry model of paired comparisons. section 4 presents our accelerated algorithms for map estimation. section 5 contains our numerical results. we conclude in section 6. section 7 contains all our proofs, additional discussions, and extensions to generalized bradley-terry models.",

agresti . we will sometimes use the parametrization {greek small letter theta}i = ewi when it is simpler to express an equation or when we want to make a connection with the literature using this parametrization. using parameterization w = {down tack}belong to irn, we have pr = ewi ewi + ewj . all our convergence results are for the model with parameter w. the bradley-terry type models for paired comparisons with ties, choice, and full ranking outcomes, we refer to as generalized bradley-terry models, are defined in section 7.15. our results apply to all these different models. in the main body of the paper, we focus only on the bradley-terry model for paired comparisons in order to keep the presentation simple. maximum likelihood estimation the maximum likelihood parameter estimation problem corresponds to finding w {star operator}that solves the following optimisation problem: max wbelong to irn {script small l} where {script small l} is the log-likelihood function, {script small l} = n {n-ary summation} i=1 {n-ary summation} j {combining long solidus overlay}=i di,j ) with di,j denoting the number of observed paired comparisons such that i {succeeds}j. the maximum likelihood optimisation problem is a convex optimization problem. note, however, that the objective function is not a strictly concave function as adding a common constant to each element of the parameter vector keeps the value of the objective function unchanged. map estimation problem an alternative objective is obtained by using a bayesian inference framework, which amounts to finding a maximum a posteriori estimate of the parameter vector under a given prior distribution. we consider the bayesian method introduced by caron and doucet , which assumes the prior distribution to be of product-form with marginal distributions such that {greek small letter theta}i has a gamma distribution where {greek small letter alpha} {greater-than or equal to}1 is the shape parameter and beta > 0 is the rate parameter. note that {greek small letter alpha} and beta affect the scale of the parameter vector as with respect to the gamma prior distribution, {greek small letter theta}i has the expected value and the mode equal to {greek small letter alpha}/beta and /beta, respectively. for any fixed {greek small letter alpha} {greater-than or equal to}1, the density of gamma distribution becomes more flat as beta approaches zero which corresponds to a less informative prior. according to the assumed prior distribution, {n-ary summation} n i=1 {greek small letter theta}i {tilde operator} gamma and, hence, the mode of {n-ary summation} n i=1 {greek small letter theta}i is /beta. we can interpret the mode of {n-ary summation} n i=1 {greek small letter theta}i as the scale of the parameter vector. vojnovic, yun and zhou: accelerated mm algorithms for ranking scores inference from comparison data 6 the log-a posteriori probability function can be written as {greek small letter rho} = {script small l} + {script small l}0 where {script small l}is the log-likelihood function in and {script small l}0 is the log-likelihood of the prior distribution given by {script small l}0 = n {n-ary summation} i=1 wi -betaewi) . note that for {greek small letter alpha} = 1 and beta = 0, the log-a posteriori probability function corresponds to the log-likelihood function. for these values of parameters {greek small letter alpha} and beta, map and ml estimation problems are equivalent. mm algorithms the mm algorithm for minimizing a function f is defined by minimizing a surrogate function that majorizes f. a surrogate function g is said to be a majorant function of f if f {less-than or equal to}g and f = g for all x and y. the mm algorithm is defined by the iterative updates: x = argmin x g). for maximizing a function f, we can analogously define the mm algorithm as minimization of a surrogate function g that minorizes function f. majorization surrogate functions are used for minimization of convex functions, and minorization surrogate functions are used for maximization of concave functions. the classic mm algorithm for the bradleyterry model of paired comparisons uses the following minorization function of {script small l}: {script small l} = n {n-ary summation} i=1 {n-ary summation} j {combining long solidus overlay}=i {script small l}ij, where {script small l}ij = di,j x12 xi -exi + exj eyi + eyj -log + 1 x13 . it is easy to observe that {script small l} is a minorization surrogate function of {script small l} by noting that log {less-than or equal to}x -1 and that equality holds if, and only if, x = 1, which is used to break log terms in the log-likelihood function. the classic mm algorithm for the ml parameter estimation of the bradley-terry model of paired comparisons , hunter ), is defined by the following iterative updates, for i = 1,2, . . . , n, {greek small letter theta} i = {n-ary summation} n j=1 di,j {n-ary summation} n j=1 mi,j {greek small letter theta} i + {greek small letter theta} j . following caron and doucet , the mm algorithm for the map parameter estimation of the bradley-terry model of paired comparisons is derived for the minorant surrogate function {greek small letter rho} of function {greek small letter rho} in , defined as {greek small letter rho} = {script small l} + {script small l}0 where {script small l} is the minorant surrogate function of the log-likelihood function and {script small l}0 is the prior log-likelihood function . the iterative updates of the mm algorithm are defined by, for i = 1,2, . . . , n, {greek small letter theta} = {greek small letter alpha} -1 + {n-ary summation}j {combining long solidus overlay}=i di,j beta + {n-ary summation}j {combining long solidus overlay}=i mi,j {greek small letter theta} i + {greek small letter theta} j . note that this iterative optimization algorithm corresponds to the classic mm algorithm for ml estimation when {greek small letter alpha} = 1 and beta = 0. we also consider gradient descent algorithm with constant step size {greek small letter eta} > 0, which has iterative updates as x = x - {greek small letter eta} {nabla}f ). our goal in this paper is to characterize the rate of convergence of mm algorithms for generalized bradley-terry models. we also derive convergence rates for gradient descent algorithms. it is natural to consider gradient descent algorithms as they belong to the class of first-order optimization methods . intuitively, the rate of convergence of an iterative algorithm quantifies how fast the value of the objective function converges to the optimum value with the number of iterations. for an iterative optimization method for minimizing function f, which outputs a sequence of points x, x, . . , we say that vojnovic, yun and zhou: accelerated mm algorithms for ranking scores inference from comparison data 7 there is an {greek small letter alpha}-improvement with respect to f at time step t if f ) -f {less-than or equal to}) -f ) where x {star operator}is a minimizer of f. an iterative optimization method is said to have linear convergence if there exist positive constants {greek small letter alpha} and t0 such that the method yields an {greek small letter alpha}-improvement at each time step t {greater-than or equal to}t0. background on convex analysis we define some basic concepts from convex analysis that we will use throughout the paper. function f : irn {rightwards arrow}ir is {greek small letter gamma}-strongly convex on x if it satisfies the following subgradient inequality, for all x, y belong to x : f -f {less-than or equal to} {nabla}f {down tack} - {greek small letter gamma} 2 ||x -y||2. f is {greek small letter gamma}-strongly convex on x if, and only if, f - {greek small letter gamma} 2 ||x||2 is convex on x . function f is {micro sign}-smooth on x if its gradient {nabla}f is {micro sign}-lipschitz on x , i.e, for all x, y belong to x , || {nabla}f - {nabla}f || {less-than or equal to} {micro sign}||x -y||. for any {micro sign}-smooth function f on x , we also have that, for all x, y belong to x , | f -f - {nabla}f {down tack}| {less-than or equal to} {micro sign} 2 ||x -y||2. a proof of the last claim can be found in lemma 3.4 in bubeck . function f satisfies the polyak-lojasiewicz inequality on x ) if there exists {greek small letter gamma} > 0 such that for all x belong to x , f -f {less-than or equal to}1 2 {greek small letter gamma}|| {nabla}f ||2 where x*is a minimizer of f. when the pl inequality holds on x for a specific value of {greek small letter gamma}, we say that {greek small letter gamma}-pl inequality holds on x . if f is {greek small letter gamma}-strongly convex on x , then f satisfies the {greek small letter gamma}pl inequality on x .",

{greek small letter rho} = {script small l} - {script small l}, by lemma 3.3, we have lemma 3.5 for all x, y belong to n, {greek small letter rho} {greek small letter rho} {greater-than or equal to}- {greek small letter delta} 2 {parallel to}x -y {parallel to}2 where {greek small letter delta} = 1 2e2 {greek small letter omega}d. by theorem 3.2 and lemmas 3.4 and 3.5, we have the following corollary: corollary 3.4 assume w*is the maximum a posteriori parameter estimate in w {greek small letter omega} = {w belong to irn : ||w|| {infinity} {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter omega}}, for some {greek small letter omega} {greater-than or equal to}0, and w 7 {rightwards arrow} w is according to the mm algorithm. then, if w belong to w {greek small letter omega}, there is an {greek small letter alpha}m, {greek small letter omega}improvement at time step t where {greek small letter alpha}m, {greek small letter omega},beta = 2e- {greek small letter omega}beta d + 2e {greek small letter omega}beta. from corollaries 3.2 and 3.4, we observe that both gradient descent algorithm and mm algorithm have the rate of convergence bound 1 {ohm sign})), and hence both have linear convergence and both have the convergence time bound . we next establish tightness of this rate of convergence by showing that it is achieved for a simple instance.",

we used 10-4 as the default value for parameter {greek small letter xi}. for nascar dataset, we also present results for several other values of {greek small letter xi} to demonstrate how the convergence time changes. in our experiments, we also evaluated the convergence time measured in real processor time units. we noted that they validate all the observations derived from the convergence times measured in the number of iterations, and hence we do not further discuss them. in our experiments we varied the value of parameter beta and, unless specified otherwise, we set the value of parameter {greek small letter alpha} such that {greek small letter alpha} 1 = beta. this corresponds to fixing the mode of the gamma prior marginal distributions to value 1. note that the case beta = 0 corresponds to ml estimation. before discussing numerical convergence time results, we first show results validating that the mm algorithm converges and that this convergence is linear. this is shown in figure 4 for gifgif a dataset for three different values of parameter beta. for space reasons, we only include results for this dataset. we observe that in all cases the log-a posteriori probability monotonically increases with the number of iterations, thus validating convergence. we also observe that the gap between the maximum log-a posteriori probability and the log-a posteriori probability decreases with the number of iterations in a linear fashion for sufficiently large number of iterations, when plotted using the logarithmic scale for the y axis, thus validating linear convergence. we next discuss our numerical results for convergence time evaluated for the mm algorithm and accelerated mm algorithm for different datasets and choice of parameters. our numerical results are shown in table 2. for gifgif datasets, we observe that the convergence time increases as the value of parameter beta decreases for beta > 0. for the values of beta considered, this increase can be for as much as two orders of magnitude. when the ml estimate exists , we observe that the mm algorithm for ml estimation converges much faster than the mm algorithm for map

algorithm. this reduction can be for as much as order 10% of the convergence time of the mm algorithm without acceleration. these empirical results validate our theoretical results. for chess datasets, all the observations derived by using the gifgif datasets remain to hold. for nascar dataset, we show results for different values of parameter {greek small letter xi}, including the default value of 10-4. again, all the observations made for gifgif and chess datasets remain to hold. it is noteworthy that the mm algorithm for ml estimation converges much faster than for map estimation for sufficiently small values of parameter beta. this is especially pronounced for smaller values of {greek small letter xi}. for the cases considered, this can be for as much as three orders of magnitude. similarly, the accelerated mm algorithm converges much faster than the classical mm algorithm. in the reminder of this section we highlight the importance of carefully changing the scale of the parameter vector in each iteration, as done in our accelerated mm algorithm, algorithm 1, as otherwise the monotonic convergence may not be guaranteed or the convergence may be slow. to demonstrate this, we examine the alternative change of scale such that the parameter vector w in each iteration satisfies {n-ary summation} n i=1 ewi = 1. we present the results for the gifgif datasets. from figure 5, we observe that the algorithm does not guarantee a monotonic increase of the a posteriori probability with the number of iterations, which is unlike to our accelerated mm algorithm for which this always holds. in table 3, we show the same quantities as in table 2 but for the mm algorithm with the alternative change of scale under consideration. we observe that our acceleration method can converge much faster, and that there are cases for which the alternative change of scale results in no convergence within a bound on the maximum number of iterations.",

oscillation of lepton flavor, or - neutrino oscillation . this e {latin small ligature ff}ect manifests itself as a quasi-periodic probability to observe charged leptons {script small l} {greek small letter alpha} and {script small l}beta in, respectively, the source and the detector of neutrino. simplifying the consideration to only two neutrino types {greek small letter nu}1 and {greek small letter nu}2, the corresponding probability in the plane wave model reads p {greek small letter alpha}beta = sin2 2 {greek small letter theta} sin2 {increment}m2l 4p , {greek small letter alpha} , beta, p {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter alpha} = 1 -sin2 2 {greek small letter theta} sin2 {increment}m2l 4p . in eq. {greek small letter theta} is the mixing angle, parameterizing the pmns matrix v in eq. , {increment}m2 = m2 2-m2 1, l is the distance between the source and the detector and p is the absolute value of neutrino three-momentum. in a two-neutrino model the oscillation probability is strictly periodic as a function of l/p. the corresponding oscillation length losc = 4 {greek small letter pi}p/ {increment}m2 = 2.48km p mev 10-3ev2 {increment}m2 is of macroscopic magnitude for observed {increment}m2 and typical neutrino momenta. the plane-wave model of neutrino oscillation being used elsewhere is not self-consistent and leads to a number of paradoxes . a consistent model adopts wave-packets. the oscillation probability in eq. is modified and in the wave-packet model it depends on three more parameters having dimension of length -

    "Text": "3.1 masses of fermions in the sm the main trick to create a sterile neutrino state is to add to the sm a neutrino field without adding the fourth left-handed fields of leptons. in order to explain it, let us recall how the masses of fermions appear in the sm. we simplify our consideration by examining only the dirac-type particles in order to keep the analysis simple and clear. a fundamental idea of the sm is a requirement of gauge invariance of the lagrangian under a particular symmetry, sul*u. all fermions in the sm are massless because the corresponding mass-term is not gauge invariant. to illustrate this statement let us consider first the mass-term of only one generation of charged leptons -m x10 {script small l}l {script small l}r + h.c. x11 equation is not gauge invariant because the left-handed {script small l}l and right-handed {script small l}r fields have di {latin small ligature ff}erent gauge symmetries: sul*u and u, respectively. the masses of fermions are acquired via the so-called yukawa interactions of a scalar field with two fields of fermions. originally, this interaction was proposed to explain an attractive potential of two nucleons interacting with each other by exchange of a scalar massive field the pion. in the sm the same terminology is used to describe interactions of fermions with the only fundamental scalar field of the model - the higgs field {greek phi symbol}. the yukawa term in the lagrangian for charged leptons reads ly = - {greek small letter lamda} x10 {greek small letter nu}l, {script small l}l x11 0 {greek phi symbol} ! {script small l}r + h.c. the replacement {greek phi symbol} {rightwards arrow}v + {greek small letter chi} {square root} 2, where v is a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the higgs field, generates the mass term in eq. with m = {greek small letter lamda}v and a term describing an interaction of fermions with an excitation {greek small letter chi} of the higgs field above vev. the masses of the neutrinos are generated in a similar way replacing 0 {greek phi symbol} ! by - {greek phi symbol}c 0 ! , where {greek phi symbol}c is a charge-conjugated higgs field, and replacing {script small l}r by {greek small letter nu}r. the right-handed neutrino field {greek small letter nu}r does not interact with w and z, and thus is often called sterile. this is not the sterile field one needs in interpretations of anomalies in neutrino data mentioned in sec. 2. in order to generalize our consideration of the case of generations of leptons one should add three right-handed fields for charged leptons {script small l}er, {script small l} {micro sign}r, {script small l} {greek small letter tau}r and three right-handed fields for neutrinos {greek small letter nu}er, {greek small letter nu} {micro sign}r, {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter tau}r. the most general yukawa lagrangian gives non-diagonal terms for charged leptons and neutrinos -m {script small l} {greek small letter alpha}beta x10 {script small l} {greek small letter alpha}l {script small l}betar + h.c. x11 -m {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter alpha}beta x10 {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter alpha}l {greek small letter nu}betar + h.c. x11 . m {script small l}and m {greek small letter nu} are non-diagonal matrices with matrix elements m {script small l} {greek small letter alpha}beta and m {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter alpha}beta, respectively. both terms in eq. must be diagonalized in order to be interpreted as mass-terms. the diagonalization can be done with the help of four matrices u {script small l} l, u {script small l} r, u {greek small letter nu} l and u {greek small letter nu} r, rotating {script small l}l, {script small l}r, {greek small letter nu}l and {greek small letter nu}r, respectively, where {script small l}t = x10 {script small l}e, {script small l} {micro sign}, {script small l} {greek small letter tau} x11 and {greek small letter nu}t = x10 {greek small letter nu}e, {greek small letter nu} {micro sign}, {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter tau} x11 . the rotation matrices make u {script small l} l m {script small l}u {script small l} r and u {greek small letter nu} l m {greek small letter nu}u {greek small letter nu} r diagonal. as a result, the fields with definite masses and belonging to di {latin small ligature ff}erent sul doublets mix in their interactions with w boson as shown in eq. . the corresponding mixing pmns-matrix reads v = u {script small l} l u {greek small letter nu} l. this matrix should not be attributed, as done often in the literature, to neutrino fields. instead, v is a mixing matrix of both charged leptons and neutrinos. the reviewed mass-generation mechanism used fields for three charged leptons and three neutrinos.",

        "Text": "the sterile neutrino emerges if there are four right-handed neutrino and still three left-handed doublets. let us label the fourth right-handed neutrino field as {greek small letter nu}s r. assuming that this new field interacts with the higgs and left-handed neutrino fields in yukawa interactions, one arrives at non-diagonal terms like in eq. in which m {greek small letter nu} is replaced by a 4 * 4 matrix and an additional fourth left-handed field is constructed as x10 {greek small letter nu}s r x11c. making the diagonalization, one finds that 3 * 3 mixing matrix v is replaced by a 4 * 4 matrix v3*3 k3*1 u1*3 m1*1, ! in which the dimension of each sub-block is displayed. the unitarity of this matrix yields the following relationships vv + uu = 13*3, kk + mm = 11*1, vv + kk = 13*3, uu + mm = 11*1, vk + um = 03*1, vu + km = 03*1. grouping flavor neutrino fields into {greek small letter nu} f = x10 {greek small letter nu}e, {greek small letter nu} {micro sign}, {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter tau} x11t and massive neutrino fields into {greek small letter nu}m = t, the relationship in eq. is generalized as {greek small letter nu} f l c ! = v3*3 k3*1 u1*3 m1*1 ! {greek small letter nu}m l {greek small letter nu}4 l ! . the left-handed neutrino field {greek small letter nu}s l {identical to}c being made of a sterile right-handed field, remains sterile in terms of interactions with w and z-bosons. at the same time fields {greek small letter nu}m l and {greek small letter nu}4 l do interact with w and z bosons. what can be said about widths of w and z bosons in the presence of new fields {greek small letter nu}4 l and {greek small letter nu}s l? the corresponding amplitude, assuming coherence of the sterile neutrino state and using eq. , reads for w aw = 3 x i=1 u* 1iv {greek small letter alpha}iaw i + m* 11k {greek small letter alpha}1aw 4 {asymptotically equal to} {greek small letter alpha}1aw 0 = 0, where aw i , aw 4 are interaction amplitudes for massive neutrinos and aw 0 is the corresponding amplitude assuming zero neutrino mass. similarly, one can show that for the z boson, within the same assumptions, the amplitudes read az = x j u* 1 jaz ji + m* 11az 4i {asymptotically equal to}az 0 x10 v h vu + kmix11 i1 = 0, az = x j u* 1 jaz j4 + m* 11az 44 {asymptotically equal to}az 0 x10 k h vu + kmix11 11 = 0. equations and show that the interaction amplitudes of a sterile neutrino state with w and z are both vanishing. therefore, decays of w and z involving sterile neutrinos should also vanish in the end. we made an important assumption that a coherent superposition of neutrino states | {greek small letter nu}i {mathematical right angle bracket}and | {greek small letter nu}4 {mathematical right angle bracket}making up the sterile state | {greek small letter nu}s {mathematical right angle bracket}= p3 i=1 u* 1i| {greek small letter nu}i {mathematical right angle bracket}+ m* 11| {greek small letter nu}4 {mathematical right angle bracket}can be produced. as mentioned in section 1 use of states with definite momentum is an approximation which fails in describing neutrino oscillation phenomenon. a more consistent approach is based on using the wave-packet model which necessarily imposes a non-zero incoherency in the production of states with di {latin small ligature ff}erent masses. the term suppressing the coherence of neutrino states is the second term in eq. . the coherence is suppressed if the wave-packet spatial dimension {greek small letter sigma}x is comparable to or larger than the oscillation length losc. let us note that in the plane wave model {greek small letter sigma}x = {infinity}. what happens to w and z widths if the | {greek small letter nu}s {mathematical right angle bracket}state cannot be produced as a coherent superposition of | {greek small letter nu}i {mathematical right angle bracket}and | {greek small letter nu}4 {mathematical right angle bracket}states? let us focus only on the z-boson decay width. one can observe that the diagonal in the sm vertex g cos {greek small letter theta}w x {greek small letter alpha}=e, {micro sign}, {greek small letter tau} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter alpha},l {greek small letter gamma} {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter alpha},lz {micro sign} = g cos {greek small letter theta}w 3 x i=1 {greek small letter nu}i,l {greek small letter gamma} {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}i,lz {micro sign} of z-boson interaction with neutrino is no longer diagonal in an extension of the sm with sterile neutrinos. keeping only essential factors, this vertex now reads x {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter alpha} {rightwards arrow} x i, j x10 vv x11 i j {greek small letter nu}i {greek small letter nu} j + x i x10 vk x11 i1 {greek small letter nu}i {greek small letter nu}4 + x i x10 kv x11 1i {greek small letter nu}4 {greek small letter nu}i + x10 kk x11 11 {greek small letter nu}4 {greek small letter nu}4. the first term in eq. suggests that the decay width z {rightwards arrow} {greek small letter nu}i {greek small letter nu} j is proportional to |i j|2 and therefore, summation over i, j yields x i, j {greek capital letter gamma} {proportional to}tr x10 vvvv x11 . a similar calculation can be applied to all other possible final states. therefore, the width p i, j {greek capital letter gamma} + p i {greek capital letter gamma} + p i {greek capital letter gamma} + {greek capital letter gamma} of a z-boson decaying into neutrino and anti-neutrino is proportional to tr x10 vvvv + vkkv + kvvk + kkkk x11 = tr x10 vvvv + vvkk + kvvk + kkkkx11 = tr x10 vv + kkx112 = 3, where for the last equality we used first unitarity relation in the second line of eq. . thus, according to eq. , the expected width of a z boson decaying into all possible combinations of four neutrino and anti-neutrino states is determined by three generations of leptons avoiding inconsistency with the observed decay width of z boson. in order to get a simpler understanding of how this magic happened, it is instructive to consider only one lepton generation, rather than three, for example x00 {greek small letter nu}e,l, el x01. let us now add two right-handed neutrino fields and a yukawa interaction term which should be diagonalized, similar to considerations with three generations of leptons. instead of eq. one gets {greek small letter nu}e {greek small letter nu}s ! = cos {greek small letter theta} sin {greek small letter theta} -sin {greek small letter theta} cos {greek small letter theta} ! {greek small letter nu}1 {greek small letter nu}2 ! . the flavor part of the lagrangian given by eq. for z boson interaction with {greek small letter nu}e and {greek small letter nu}e is replaced by cos2 {greek small letter theta} {greek small letter nu}1 {greek small letter nu}1 + sin {greek small letter theta} cos {greek small letter theta} + sin2 {greek small letter theta}2 {greek small letter nu}2 {greek small letter nu}2. therefore, the width of z boson decaying into any of {greek small letter nu}i {greek small letter nu} j, is proportional to cos4 {greek small letter theta} |{z} {greek small letter nu}1 {greek small letter nu}1 + sin2 {greek small letter theta} cos2 {greek small letter theta} | {z } {greek small letter nu}2 {greek small letter nu}1 + sin2 {greek small letter theta} cos2 {greek small letter theta} | {z } {greek small letter nu}1 {greek small letter nu}2 + sin4 {greek small letter theta} |{z} {greek small letter nu}2 {greek small letter nu}2 = x10 cos2 {greek small letter theta} + sin2 {greek small letter theta} x112 = 1. thus, we find that the corresponding decay width is proportional to one, while there are two massive neutrinos {greek small letter nu}1 and {greek small letter nu}2 both interacting with z. the original coupling of z {greek small letter nu}e {greek small letter nu}e vertex is redistributed over four combinations of two fields conserving the total strength of the interaction as illustrated by eqs. and . let us briefly summarize key elements of the concept of sterile neutrinos. assume a disparity between the numbers of neutrino fields interacting and noninteracting directly with w and z bosons in the sm. for example, assuming dirac neutrinos, there are three left-handed interacting and four right-handed non-interacting with w and z, neutrino fields. assume a mechanism of mixing active and inert neutrino fields in a generally nondiagonal mass-term. an example of such mechanism is the yukawa interaction. other mechanisms also exist. the sterile neutrino field emerges after the diagonalization of the mass-term. the sterile field is a superposition of at least four massive neutrino fields with nearly zero interaction amplitude with w and z. this amplitude corresponds to a coherent superposition of all four neutrino states. the widths of w and z bosons decaying into any possible combination of neutrino and anti-neutrino states is proportional to the number of active neutrino fields .",

    "Text": "we reviewed main concepts of sterile neutrinos - a yet hypothetical particle, coined to resolve some anomalies in neutrino data. in the framework of an extension of the sm, a sterile neutrino field is a superposition of fields of massive neutrinos. the corresponding interaction amplitude of the sterile neutrino state vanishes if states of massive neutrinos are coherent. even in the case when massive neutrinos are in incoherent mixture, the widths of decays of w {rightwards arrow} {script small l} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter nu}i and z {rightwards arrow} {greek small letter nu}i {greek small letter nu} j, where i, j belong to , are proportional to the number of active neutrino species , thus avoiding inconsistencies with observations. this elegant theoretical construction appears when there is a disparity between active and inert numbers of neutrino fields in an extension of the sm. currently, there are data consistent with sterile neutrino hypothesis at about 3 {greek small letter sigma} with {increment}m2 = 1.3 ev2 and |ve4|2 {almost equal to}0.1. on the other hand there is a bulk of accelerator and atmospheric data strongly disfavoring lsnd and miniboone anomalies as due to sterile neutrino oscillation. finally, cosmology also disfavors a fourth neutrino with ev mass and |v {greek small letter alpha}4| {asymptotically equal to}0.1 - the only currently available domain of parameters for sterile neutrino hypothesis of reactor {greek small letter nu}e data. still, the allowed parameter space is within the sensitivity region of currently running experiments .",

    "Text": "we begin with the following definition. definition 2.1. a ring r is said to be regular left fusible if for any nonzero element r belong to r there exists a regular element s belong to r such that the element sr is left fusible, i.e. sr = c + w, where c is a left zero divisor and w is left regular. since every left regular element is left fusible, our definition reduces to the requirement that for every nonzero left zero divisor a there exists a regular element s in r such that the element sa is left fusible. it is also clear that every left fusible ring is regular left fusible . the following example shows that the class of left fusible rings is strictly smaller than the one of regular left fusible rings. example 2.2. let f be a field and set r = f < x, y | x2 = 0 >. by , the set of all left zero divisors of r is equal to xr. in particular, a di {latin small ligature ff}erence of any two left zero divisors is a left zero divisor as well. thus r is not left fusible. notice that y is a regular element of r and yr = 0 + yr is a left fusible decomposition of yr, for any nonzero element r belong to r. thus r is a regular left fusible ring. similarly, one can see that r is not right fusible but it is regular right fusible. we will use the above example to answer question of . before doing so let us recall some notions. a ring r is a left p.p. ring if any principal left ideal of r is projective and r is said to be left p.q.-baer if the left annihilators of principal left ideals are generated as left ideals by an idempotent. birkenmeier et al. in proved that a ring r is an abelian left p.p. ring if and only if r is a reduced p.q.-baer ring. it was proved in that every abelian left p.p. ring is fusible and that, in general, p.q.-baer rings do not have to be left fusible . question of asks whether every abelian p.q.-baer ring is fusible. the following example shows that the answer to this question is negative. example 2.3. let r = f < x, y | x2 = 0 > be the ring defined in example 2.2. since elements from yr are left regular, we get ayb {combining long solidus overlay}= 0, for any nonzero a, b belong to r. thus r is a prime ring, so it is also a p.q.-baer ring. the only idempotents of r are 0 and 1 . this can be checked directly or one can apply a classical result of herstein . by , the set of all nilpotent elements of r is equal to xrx. the subring f is invariant under all inner automorphisms adjoint to elements of the form , n belong to xrx but f is neither contained in the center nor contains a nonzero ideal of r. therefore, by , the ring r does not contain nontrivial idempotents. thus r is an abelian p.q.-baer ring. we have already seen in example 2.2 that r is neither left nor right fusible. example 2.2 also suggests that although abelian p.q.-baer rings need not be fusible but maybe they have to be regular fusible. we are unable to answer the following question: question 2.4. is every abelian left p.q.-baer ring regular left fusible? on fusible rings 3 now we will move to some basic properties of regular left fusible rings. recall that a left ideal i of a ring r is essential if a {intersection}i {combining long solidus overlay}= 0 for every nonzero left ideal a of r. lemma 2.5. let a, b belong to r be such that lannr <e rr and lannr {combining long solidus overlay}= 0. then lannr {combining long solidus overlay}= 0. in particular, every element element a such that lannr <e rr can not be left fusible. proof. the imposed assumptions imply that lannr {intersection}lannr {combining long solidus overlay}= 0, so the thesis is clear. {white square} the left singular ideal of a ring r is singl = {x belong to r | lannr <e rr}. it is well known that singl is a two-sided ideal of r. a ring r is called left nonsingular if singl = 0. the following lemma generalizes . lemma 2.6. every regular left fusible ring r is left nonsingular. proof. assume 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= a belong to singl. since r is regular left fusible, we can pick a regular element s belong to r such that sa is left fusible. since singl is a two-sided ideal, sa belong to singl. thus, by lemma 2.5, sa is not left fusible, a contradiction. {white square} let s denote the left ore set consisting of regular element of the ring r and let s-1r be the left ore localization of r. writing ql we will mean that r possesses a classical left quotient ring which is equal to ql. lemma 2.7. let s belong to s and a belong to r. then lanns-1r {combining long solidus overlay}= 0 if and only if lannr {combining long solidus overlay}= 0. proof. suppose bs-1a = 0, for some nonzero b belong to s-1r. eventually multiplying on the left by a suitable element from s, we may assume 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= b belong to r. since s is the left ore set, there exists t belong to s and 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= c belong to r such that bs-1 = t-1c. then 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= c belong to lannr. suppose ca = 0, for some 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= c belong to r. then s-1a = 0, so s-1a is a left zero divisor in s-1r. {white square} proposition 2.8. let r be a ring. if r is left fusible, then so is s-1r. if r is regular left fusible, then ql is left fusible. if s-1r is regular left fusible, then r is regular left fusible. suppose every regular element of r is invertible. then r is regular left fusible i {latin small ligature ff} r is left fusible. proof. let s-1r belong to s-1r. as r is left fusible, r has a left fusible decomposition, say r = a + w. lemma 2.7 shows that s-1r = s-1a + s-1w is a left fusible decomposition of s-1r. suppose r is regular left fusible. let 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= s-1r belong to ql. then there exists a regular element t belong to r such that tr has a fusible decomposition tr = a + w. by lemma 2.7, s-1r = -1a + -1w is a fusible decomposition of s-1r in ql. 4 kos {cedilla}an, matczuk let r belong to r. since s-1r is regular left fusible, there exists a regular element s-1 1 t1 belong to s-1r such that the element z = s1-1t1r has a left fusible decomposition, say s1-1t1r = s2-1a2 + s3-1w3. taking the left common denominator, we may write z = s-1tr = s-1a + s-1w for suitable s belong to s, t, a, w belong to r. by lemma 2.7, t is regular, w is left regular and a is a left zero divisor of r. this implies that the element tr is left fusible in r and hence r is regular left fusible. by assumption, r = ql. let r belong to r. suppose r is regular left fusible. there exists a regular element t belong to r such that tr has a fusible decomposition tr = a + w. then, by lemma 2.7, r = t-1a + t-1w is a fusible decomposition of r. this yields the proof of . {white square} the above proposition gives immediately the following: corollary 2.9. suppose r has the left quotient ring ql. the following conditions are equivalent: r is regular left fusible. ql is left fusible. ql is regular left fusible. in , the authors observed that the statement of proposition 2.8 holds when r is a commutative ring and asked whether the reverse implication holds. in the context of corollary 2.9, their question can be restated as: question 2.10. let r be a regular left fusible ring having the classical left quotient ring. is r left fusible? notice that, although the ring r in example 2.2 is not left fusible, the ring r is regular left fusible. thus the above question has a negative answer without the assumption that r possesses the classical left quotient ring. using the same arguments as in and making use of the fact that in a commutative ring r an element r is nilpotent if and only if the ideal rr is nilpotent we get the following modification of . lemma 2.11. every commutative regular fusible ring is reduced. in , the authors showed that a commutative ring with only finitely many minimal prime ideals is fusible if and only if it is reduced. using this characterization we obtain a positive, partial answer to question 2.10: proposition 2.12. let r be a commutative ring with only finitely many minimal prime ideals. the following conditions are equivalent: r is fusible. r is regular fusible. r is reduced. proof. the implication {rightwards double arrow} is a tautology. the implications {rightwards double arrow} and {rightwards double arrow} are given by lemma 2.11 and , respectively. {white square} on fusible rings 5 o {latin small ligature ff}ers a commutative ring which is reduced but is not fusible, i.e. the equivalence {leftwards double arrow} {rightwards double arrow} does not hold for arbitrary commutative rings. the ring from this example is also not regular fusible. we do not know of any example of a commutative ring which is regular fusible but not fusible. a ring r is called unit-regular if for each a belong to r there exists a unit u belong to u such that aua = a. in , the following proposition was proved. we o {latin small ligature ff}er a short direct argument. proposition 2.13. every unit-regular ring is left fusible. proof. let r be a unit-regular ring and r belong to r, i.e, 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= r = rur where u belong to r. then e = ur is an idempotent and e = + is its fusible decomposition. this shows that r is regular left fusible. now, since every regular element in r is invertible, the thesis is a direct consequence of proposition 2.8. {white square} proposition 2.8 and corollary 2.9 enable us to give the following new characterization of semiprime left goldie rings: theorem 2.14. for a semiprime ring r, the following conditions are equivalent: r is left goldie. r is regular left fusible and has finite left goldie dimension proof. suppose r is left goldie. then, by goldie's theorem, ql is a semisimple artinian ring. in particular it has finite left goldie dimension and it is a unit-regular ring. thus, by proposition 2.8, ql is left fusible. now corollary 2.9 yields that r is regular left fusible. this completes the proof of {rightwards double arrow}. let r be as in . then, by lemma 2.6, r is left nonsingular. now the implication {rightwards double arrow} is a consequence of goldie's theorem. {white square} recall that a ring r a right complemented, if for each a belong to r, there is a b belong to r such that ab = 0 and a + b is regular . by , every right complemented ring is left fusible. asks whether a right complemented ring have always possesses a right classical quotient ring? since any domain is complemented on both sides and there are domains having no a classical right quotient ring, the answer to this question is no in general. however the above theorem gives immediately the following: corollary 2.15. every right complemented ring of finite left goldie dimension has a classical left quotient ring. proof. as observed in , every right complemented ring is reduced, so it is semiprime. now the thesis is a consequence of the left version of theorem 2.14. {white square} one can easily adopt the proof of to get the following: proposition 2.16. suppose that for any finite set r1, . . . , rn belong to r{0} there exists a regular element s belong to r such that the elements sr1, . . . , srn are left fusible. then the matrix ring mn is regular left fusible. with the help of the above proposition we get: 6 kos {cedilla}an, matczuk theorem 2.17. suppose r is a regular left fusible ring having the classical left quotient ring. then the matrix ring mn is regular left fusible. proof. by corollary 2.9, ql is left fusible and proposition 2.16 shows that mn) is regular left fusible. let us notice that mn) = s-1mn, where s denotes the set of all diagonal matrices diag, where s ranges over all regular elements of r. now the thesis is a direct consequence of proposition 2.8. {white square} let r be the ring from example 2.2. then y belong to r is regular and, for any 0 {combining long solidus overlay}= r belong to r, yr is left regular, so r satisfies the assumptions of proposition 2.16. therefore we have: example 2.18. let r be the ring from example 2.2. then the matrix ring mn is regular fusible, for any n {greater-than or equal to}1. we were unable to answer the following: question 2.19. is the matrix ring mn over a regular left fusible ring r itself regular left fusible? we close the paper with an observation that regular left fusible property behaves well under polynomial extensions. essentially the same proof as in gives the following proposition 2.20. if r is regular left fusible, then so are the rings r, r and r], where {greek small letter sigma} is an automorphism of r.",

above} as drange judith egan serge gaspers alexis shaw peter shaw blair d. sullivan petra wolf abstract cluster editing, also known as correlation clustering, is a well-studied graph modification problem. in this problem, one is given a graph and the task is to perform up to k edge additions or deletions to transform it into a cluster graph, i.e, a graph consisting of a disjoint union of cliques. however, in real-world networks, clusters are often overlapping. for example in social networks, a person might belong to several communities {em dash}e.g. those corresponding to work, school, or neighborhood. other strong motivations come from biological network analysis and from language networks. trying to cluster words with similar usage in the latter can be confounded by homonyms, that is, words with multiple meanings like bat. in this paper, we introduce a new variant of cluster editing whereby a vertex can be split into two or more vertices. first used in the context of graph drawing, this operation allows a vertex v to be replaced by two vertices whose combined neighborhood is the neighborhood of v . we call the new problem cluster editing with vertex splitting and we initiate the study of it. we show that it is np-complete and fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the total number k of allowed vertexsplitting and edge-editing operations. in particular, we obtain an o-time algorithm and a 6k-vertex kernel. 1 introduction cluster editing is defined as follows. given a graph g and a non-negative integer k, one is asked whether g can be turned into a disjoint union of cliques by a sequence of at most k edge-editing operations . the problem is known to be np-complete since the work of k {caron} riv anek and mor avek and it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k, the total number of allowed edge-editing operations . over the last decade, cluster editing has been well studied from both theoretical and practical perspectives . in general, clustering results in a partitioning of the input graph. hence, it forces each vertex to be in one and only one cluster. this can be a limitation when the entity represented by a vertex plays a role in multiple clusters. this situation is recorded in work on gene regulatory networks , where enumeration of maximal cliques was considered a viable alternative to clustering. moreover, such vertices can e {latin small ligature ff}ectively hide clique-like structures and also greatly increase the computational time required to obtain an optimal solution . in this paper, we introduce a new variant, which we call cluster editing with vertex splitting in an attempt to allow for such overlapping clusters1. we show the new problem to be np-complete and investigate its parameterized complexity. we obtain a polynomial kernel using the notion of a critical cliques as introduced by lin et al. and applied to cluster editing by guo . this paper is structured as follows: in section 2, we give some basic definitions and notation used throughout the paper. in section 3, we prove that our problem is np-complete, even on graphs of bounded maximum degree. in section 4, we study the order of operations in an optimal solution and section 5 is devoted to critical cliques. in section 6, we show how to obtain a 6k-vertex author e-mail addresses: faisal.abukhzam@lau.edu.lb,

section 7 presents a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm and we conclude in section 8 with some open problems and future directions. 2 preliminaries for a positive integer n, we use to denote the set {1, 2, . . , n} of all positive integers up to n. all logarithms in this paper use 2 as their base. we use standard graph-theoretic notation and refer the reader to the textbook by diestel for commonly used definitions. all graphs in this work are simple, unweighted, and undirected. we denote the open and closed neighborhoods of a vertex v by n and n, respectively. for a subset v {prime} of vertices in a graph g, we denote by g the subgraph of g induced by v {prime}. for an introduction to parameterized complexity, fixed-parameter tractability, and kernelization, we refer the reader to the textbooks by flum and grohe , niedermeier , and cygan et al. . the exponential-time hypothesis , formulated by impagliazzo, paturi, and zane , states that there exists some positive real number s such that 3-sat on n variables and m clauses cannot be solved in 2s time. a cluster graph is a graph in which the vertex set of each connected component induces a clique. equivalently, a graph is a cluster graph if and only if the graph does not have p3 as an induced subgraph. problem definition given a graph g = , an edit sequence of length k is a sequence {greek small letter sigma} = of k operations, where each ei is one of the following operations: 1. do nothing, 2. add an edge to e, 3. delete an edge from e, and 4. split a vertex, that is, replace a vertex v by two vertices v1, v2 such that n {union}n = n. an example of the splitting operation is given in figure 1 and we call the two new vertices v1 and v2 copies of the original vertex v . we denote the graph resulting from applying an edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} to a graph g by g| {greek small letter sigma}. cluster editing with vertex splitting is then defined as follows. given a graph g and an integer k, is there an edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} of length k such that g| {greek small letter sigma} is a cluster graph? 3 n p-hardness in this section, we show that cluster editing with vertex splitting is np-complete. 2 the graph w6 . one of the three ways of transforming w6 into two k5's using six operations. figure 2: the graph w6t requires 8t -2 edits and any solution with exactly 8t -2 edits results in a disjoint union of k5s. theorem 1. cluster editing with vertex splitting is np-complete. moreover, assuming the exponential-time hypothesis, there is no 2o-time or 2o {middle dot} poly-time algorithm for it. proof. since containment in np is obvious , we focus on the np-hardness and present a reduction from 3-sat. therein, we will use two gadgets, a variable gadget and a clause gadget. the variable gadget is a wheel graph with two center vertices. an example of this graph is depicted on the left side of figure 2. we call this graph with t vertices on the outside wt and we will only consider instances with t mod 6 = 0, that is, t = 6a for some positive integer a. the clause gadget is a crown graph as depicted in figure 3. more precisely, for each variable xi, we construct a variable gadget gi which is a w6a where a is the number of clauses that contain either xi or {not sign}xi. for each clause cj, we construct a clause gadget hj as depicted in figure 3, that is, a k5 with the edges of a triangle removed. we arbitrarily assign each of the three vertices of degree two in hj to one literal in cj. finally, we connect the variable and clause gadgets as follows. if a variable xi appears in a clause cj, then let u be the vertex in hj assigned to xi . moreover, let b be the number such that cj is the bth clause containing either xi or {not sign}xi and let c = 6. let the vertices on the outer cycle of gi be v1, v2, . . . , v6a. if cj contains the literal xi, then we add the three edges {u, vc+1}, {u, vc+2}, {u, vc+3}. if cj contains the literal {not sign}xi, then we add the three edges {u, vc+2}, {u, vc+3}, {u, vc+4}. to complete the reduction, we set k = 35m -2n, where m is the number of clauses and n is the number of variables. we next show that the reduction is correct, that is, the constructed instance of cluster editing with vertex splitting is a yes-instance if and only if the original formula {greek small letter phi} of 3-sat is satisfiable. to this end, first assume that {greek small letter phi} is satisfiable and let beta be a satisfying assignment. for each variable xi, we will partition gi into k5's as follows. let a be the value such that gi is isomorphic to w6a. if beta sets xi to true, then we remove the edge {v3j, v3j+1} and add the edge {v3j+1, v3j+3} for each integer 1 {less-than or equal to}j {less-than or equal to}2a . if beta sets xi to false, then we remove the edge {v3j+1, v3j+2} and add the edge {v3j+2, v3j+4} for each 1 {less-than or equal to}j {less-than or equal to}2a. moreover, we split the two center vertices 2a -1 times. in total, we use 8a -2 modifications to transform gi into a collection of k5's. since each clause contains exactly three literals and we add six vertices for each variable appearance, the sum of lengths of cycles in all variable gadgets combined is 18m. hence, in all variable gadgets combined, we perform 24m -2n modifications. next, we modify the crown graphs. to this end, let cj be a clause and let hj be the constructed clause gadget. since beta is a satisfying assignment, at least one variable appearing in cj satisfies it. if 3 y x z the crown graph y x z good solution: one added edge and two deleted edges y x z bad solution 1: three added edges y x z bad solution 2: two splits and one added edge y x z bad solution 3: one split, one deleted edge, and one added edge figure 3: the crown graph with its four solutions of size 3. the good solution is the only solution with three operations that creates at least one isolated vertex. multiple such variables exist, then we pick one arbitrarily. let xi be the selected variable and let u be the vertex in hj assigned to xi. we first turn hj into a k4 and an isolated vertex by removing the two edges incident to u in hj and add the missing edge between the two vertices assigned to di {latin small ligature ff}erent variables. finally, we look at the edges between variable gadgets and clause gadgets. for the vertex u, note that by construction the three vertices that u is adjacent to in gi already belong to a k5 and hence we can add two edges to the two centers of the variable gadget to form a k6. for the two other vertices in hj that have edges to vertices in variable gadgets, we remove all three such edges, that is, six edges per clause. hence, we use 3+2+6 = 11 modifications for each clause. since the total number of modifications is 35m -2n and the resulting graph is a collection of k4's, k5's, and k6's, the constructed instance of cluster editing with vertex splitting is a yes-instance. for the other direction, suppose the constructed instance of cluster editing with vertex splitting is a yes-instance. we first show that 24m -2n modifications are necessary to transform all variable gadgets into cluster graphs and that this bound can only be achieved if each time exactly three consecutive vertices on the cycles are contained in the same k5. to this end, consider any variable gadget gi. by construction, gi is isomorphic to w6a for some integer a. by the counting argument from above, we show that at least 8a -2 modifications are necessary. note first that some edge in the cycle has to be removed or some vertex on the cycle has to be split as otherwise any solution would contain a clique with all vertices in the cycle and this would require at least 18a2 -9a > 8a -2 edge additions . we next analyze how many modifications are necessary to separate b vertices from the outer cycle into a clique. we require at least two modifications for the center vertices and one operation to separate the cycle on the other end . for b belong to {1, 2} these operations are enough. for b {greater-than or equal to}3, we need to add x00b 2 x01 - edges . note that the average cost per separated vertex is minimized with b = 3 with a cost of 4 for three vertices. hence, to separate all but c vertices from the cycle, we require at least 4/3 operations. the cost for making the remaining c vertices into a clique requires again x00c 2 x01 - edge additions. analogously, the optimal solution is to have c = 3 with just a single edge addition. thus, the minimum number of required operations is at least 4/3 + 2 = 8a -2 and this value can only be reached by partitioning the cycle into triples which each form a k5 with the two center vertices. note that it is always preferable to delete an edge on the outer cycle and not split one of the two 4 incident edges as splitting a vertex increases the number of vertices on the cycle and thus invokes a higher overall cost. next, we analyze the clause gadget and the edges between the di {latin small ligature ff}erent gadgets. we start with the latter. let u be a vertex in a clause gadget hj with incident edges to some variable gadget. the only way to not use at least three operations to deal with the three edges is if u is an isolated vertex or if the three neighbors do not have two more neighbors in the current solution. in the former case, we can add the two edges between u and the two centers of the respective variable gadgets to build a k6. in the latter case, we have used at least three operations more in the variable gadget than intended . since each vertex in a variable gadget is only adjacent to at most one vertex in a clause gadget, this cannot lead to an overall reduction in the number of operations and we can therefore ignore this latter case. we are now in a position to argue that at least eleven modifications are necessary for each clause gadget. first, note that at least three operations are required to transform a crown into a cluster graph. possible ways of achieving this are depicted in figure 3. in each of these possibilities, at most one vertex becomes an isolated vertex. to make two vertices independent, at least four operations are required and for three isolated vertices, at least five operations are required. as shown above, at least two operations are required for each isolated vertex with edges to variable gadgets and at least three operations are required for non-isolated vertices with edges to variable gadgets. thus, at least eleven operations are required for each clause gadget and eleven operations are su {latin small ligature ffi}cient if and only if the three vertices incident to one of the vertices in hj belong to the same k5 in the variable gadget. by the argument above, at least 24m -2n + 11m = k operations are necessary and since the constructed instance is a yes-instance, there is a way to cover all variable gadgets with k5's such that for each clause there is at least one vertex whose three neighbors in a variable gadget belong to the same k5. let cj be a clause, let u be a vertex with all three neighbors in the same k5, and let xi be the variable corresponding to this variable gadget. if xi appears positively in cj, then v3i+1, v3i+2, and v3i+3 belong to the same k5 for each i and we set xi to true. if xi appears negatively in cj, then v3i+2, v3i+3, and v3i+4 belong to the same k5 for each i and we set xi to false. note that we never set a variable to both true and false in this way. we set all remaining variables arbitrarily to true or false. by construction, the variable xi satisfies cj and since we do the same for all clauses, all clauses are satisfied, that is, the original formula {greek small letter phi} is satisfiable. thus, the constructed instance is equivalent to the original instance of 3-sat. since the reduction can clearly be computed in polynomial time, this concludes the proof for the np-hardness. for the eth-based hardness, observe that k, n, m belong to o. this implies that there are no 2o-time or 2o {middle dot} poly-time algorithms for cluster editing with vertex splitting unless the eth fails . in contrast to the reduction for cluster editing , our reduction does not produce instances with constant maximum degree. we instead observe that in our reduction, the maximum degree of the produced instances depends only on the maximum number of times a variable appears in a clause. combining this with the fact that 3-sat remains np-hard when restricted to instances where each variable appears in at most four clauses , we obtain the following corollary: corollary 1. cluster editing with vertex splitting remains np-hard on graphs with maximum degree 24. 4",

    "Text": "in this section, we show that we can always assume that a solution to cluster editing with vertex splitting has a specific structure, that is, it first adds edges, then removes edges, and finally splits vertices. we mention that removing edges can also be moved to the front or to the back and that we do not use the fact that we want to reach a cluster graph at any point. the statement therefore holds for any graph-modification problem which only adds edges, deletes edges, and splits vertices. to start, we say that two edit sequences {greek small letter sigma} and {greek small letter sigma} {prime} are equivalent if g| {greek small letter sigma} and g| {greek small letter sigma} {prime} are isomorphic. we show first that all vertex splittings can be moved to the back of the edit sequence. 5 lemma 1. for any edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} = where ei is a vertex splitting and ei+1 is an edge addition, an edge deletion, or a do-nothing operation, there is an equivalent edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} {prime} = of the same length where e {prime} i is an edge addition, an edge deletion, or a do-nothing operation and e {prime} i+1 is a vertex splitting. proof. if ei+1 is a do-nothing operation or the edge added or removed by it is not incident to one of the vertices introduced by the vertex split ei, then the edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} {prime} where e {prime} i = ei+1 and e {prime} i+1 = ei is equivalent to {greek small letter sigma} and of the same length. so assume without loss of generality that ei splits vertex v into v1 and v2 and ei+1 adds or deletes the edge {v1, w} for some vertex w. if ei+1 adds the edge {v1, w} and the edge {v, w} exists after performing the edit subsequence {greek small letter sigma}1 = , then we set e {prime} i to be the do-nothing operation. if ei+1 adds the edge {v1, w} and the edge {v, w} does not exist after performing {greek small letter sigma}1, then we let e {prime} i add the edge {v, w}. in both cases, we let e {prime} i+1 = ei with the modification that v1 is also adjacent to w. note that this is possible as v is adjacent to w after performing the edit sequence . if ei+1 deletes the edge {v1, w}, then we know that the edge {v, w} exists after performing {greek small letter sigma}1 and we can assume without loss of generality that the edge {v2, w} does not exists after performing the edit sequence . hence, we let e {prime} i remove the edge {v, w} and let e {prime} i+1 = ei with the modification that v1 is no longer adjacent to w. in all cases, the graphs reached after performing the edit sequences and are identical and hence performing the edit sequence {greek small letter sigma}*= afterwards shows that {greek small letter sigma} and {greek small letter sigma} {prime} are equivalent . we show next that moving edge additions to the front results in an equivalent edit sequence. lemma 2. for any edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} = where ei is an edge deletion and ei+1 is an edge addition, at least one of the edit sequences {greek small letter sigma} {prime} = where e {prime} i = ei+1 and e {prime} i+1 = ei or both are do-nothing operations is of the same length and equivalent to {greek small letter sigma}. proof. note that if ei+1 adds the edge that ei removed, then replacing these two operations with do-nothing operations results in the same graph. if ei+1 adds a di {latin small ligature ff}erent edge than ei removed, then the graphs reached after the edit subsequences {greek small letter sigma}1 = and {greek small letter sigma}2 = are identical. hence, performing the edit sequence {greek small letter sigma}*= afterwards results in isomorphic graphs for both starting edit sequences. note that performing {greek small letter sigma}1 first and then {greek small letter sigma}*is equivalent to performing {greek small letter sigma} and performing {greek small letter sigma}2 first and {greek small letter sigma}*afterwards is equivalent to performing {greek small letter sigma} {prime} where e {prime} i = ei+1 and e {prime} i+1 = ei. this concludes the proof. we can easily deduce the following theorem from the two above lemmata. theorem 2. for any edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} = , there is an edit sequence {greek small letter sigma} {prime} = such that 1. k {prime} {less-than or equal to}k, 2. {greek small letter sigma} and {greek small letter sigma} {prime} are equivalent, 3. e {prime} i is not a do-nothing operations for any i belong to . 4. if e {prime} i is an edge addition and e {prime} j is an edge deletion or a vertex splitting, then i < j, 5. if e {prime} i is an edge deletion and e {prime} j is a vertex splitting, then i < j, and proof. let {greek small letter sigma} = be any edit sequence. if ei is a do-nothing operation for some i belong to , then the edit sequence is equivalent and shorter. hence, we can assume that {greek small letter sigma} does not contain any do-nothing operations. if there exists a vertex-splitting operation ei and an operation ej with j > 0 such that ej is not a vertex-splitting operation, then let i {prime} be the last index of a vertex-splitting operation such that ei {prime}+1 is not a vertex-splitting operation. by lemma 1, we can modify {greek small letter sigma} into an equivalent edit sequence where e {prime} j = ej for all j belong to {i {prime}, i {prime} + 1} and ei {prime}+1 is a vertex-splitting operation and ei {prime} is not. if e {prime} i {prime} is a donoting operation, we can again remove it. performing this procedure repeatedly until no longer 6 applicable results in an edit sequence {greek small letter sigma}1 that is equivalent to {greek small letter sigma}, does not contain any do-nothing operations and all edge-addition and edge-deletion operations come before all vertex-splitting operations. if {greek small letter sigma}1 performs an edge-deletion operation ei before an edge-addition operation ej , then there is also an index i {prime} such that ei {prime} is an edge-deletion operation and ei {prime}+1 is an edgeaddition operation. we can then use lemma 2 to obtain a new sequence in which the number of index pairs with i < j, ei is an edge-deletion operation, and ei is an edge-addition operation is reduced by at least one. if the application of lemma 2 introduces a do-nothing operation, then we again remove it. repeatedly applying lemma 2 finally results in an equivalent sequence {greek small letter sigma} {prime} where the number of mentioned index pairs is zero, that is, all edge-addition operation come before all edge-deletion operations. note that {greek small letter sigma} {prime} now satisfies all requirements of the theorem statement. we refer to an edit sequence satisfying the statement of theorem 2 as an edit sequence in standard form. 5",

    "Text": "originally introduced by lin et al. , critical cliques provide a useful tool in understanding the clique structure in graphs. definition 1. a critical clique is a subset of vertices c that is maximal with the properties that 1. c is a clique 2. there exists u {subset of or equal to}v s.t. n = u for all v belong to c. equivalently, two vertices u and v belong to the same critical clique if and only if they are true twins, that is, n = n. hence, each vertex v appears in exactly one critical clique. the critical clique quotient graph c of g contains a node for each critical clique in g and two nodes are adjacent if and only if the two respective critical cliques c1 and c2 are adjacent, that is, there is an edge between each vertex in c1 and each vertex in c2. note that by the definition of critical cliques, this is equivalent to the condition that at least one edge {u, v} with u belong to c1 and v belong to c2 exists. to avoid confusion, we will call the vertices in c nodes and in g vertices. the following lemma is adapted from lemma 1 by guo with a careful restatement in the context of our new problem.2 lemma 3 . let be a yes-instance of cluster editing with vertex splitting. then, there exists a solution {greek small letter sigma} of length at most k such that for each critical clique ci in g and each clique sj in g| {greek small letter sigma}, either sj contains exactly one copy of each vertex in ci or sj does not contain any copy of a vertex in ci. proof. let {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma} be an optimal solution for in standard form. for each critical clique ci, we select a representative vertex ri belong to ci by picking any vertex in ci with fewest appearances in {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma}. if it holds for each critical clique ci in g and each clique sj in the resulting cluster graph g| {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma} that sj contains exactly one copy of each vertex in ci or sj does not contain any copy of a vertex in ci, then {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma} satisfies all requirements of the lemma statement and we are done. otherwise, there exists a clique sj in g| {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma} which contains two copies of some vertex v or there exists a critical clique ci and two vertices u, v belong to ci such that sj contains a copy of u but no copy of v. in the former case, note that removing any operations involving one of the two copies results in a solution of strictly shorter length, contradicting the fact that {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma} was an optimal solution. in the latter case, there also exists such a pair of vertices where one of the two vertices is ri. let w be the other vertex. we find a new optimal solution by removing all operations involving w and copying all operations including ri and replacing ri by w in the copy. for the sake of notational convenience, we 2we mention in passing that we claimed a slightly stronger lemma in a previous version of this paper. firbas et al. observed that the stronger version does not hold and conjectured that this weaker version is true. we confirm this here. 7 say that that if some operation involves the jth copy of ri, then the very next operation will be the copy and will use the jth copy of w.3 since w is involved in at least as many operations as ri , the resulting sequence {greek small letter sigma} {prime} will be at most as long as {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma}. we next show that {greek small letter sigma} {prime} is also a solution. if the resulting graph g| {greek small letter sigma} {prime} is not a cluster graph, then it contains an induced p3. let x be an induced p3 in g| {greek small letter sigma} {prime}. since we only modified operations for w, some copy of w has to be part of x. let j be the index such that x contains the jth copy of w. if x contains another copy of w, then the two copies are the two ends. the center cannot be a copy of ri as each copy of w is only adjacent to the corresponding copy of ri and vice versa. hence, we have another induced p3 where we replace the two copies of w by their respective copies of ri. this contradicts that {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma} is a solution. so assume that x contains only the jth copy of w. if x does not contain the jth copy of ri, then the graph contains also a p3 where we replace the jth copy w by the jth copy of ri. this again contradicts the assumption that {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma} is a solution. thus, we may assume that x contains both the jth copy of ri and the jth copy of w. since these two vertices are adjacent, one of the two vertices is the center of x. however, all other vertices have either both or none of the two vertices as neighbors. this contradicts that x exists. hence, {greek small letter sigma} {prime} is also a solution. note that the number of vertices that behave di {latin small ligature ff}erently than their representative is one smaller in {greek small letter sigma} {prime} compared to {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma}. hence, repeating the above procedure at most n times results results in an optimal solution {greek small letter sigma} as stated in the lemma. in the following two sections, we will use lemma 3 to develop a linear-vertex kernel and a 2o-time algorithm.

    "Text": "in this section, we prove a problem kernel for cluster editing with vertex splitting with at most 6k vertices based on the critical clique lemma and a similar kernel for cluster editing by guo . to this end, we propose three reduction rules, prove that they are safe4, that they can be performed exhaustively in linear time, and that their application gives a kernel as required. we start with the simplest one. reduction rule 1. remove all isolated cliques. lemma 4. reduction rule 1 is safe. proof. notice that for any optimal solution {greek small letter sigma}, each clique in g| {greek small letter sigma} only contains copies of vertices of one connected component in g. hence, if a clique contains a copy of a vertex in an isolated clique k in g, then it only contains copies of vertices in k. since k by definition does not require any operations to be transformed into a clique with no outgoing edges, removing k results in an equivalent instance of cluster editing with vertex splitting. we next bound the size of each critical clique in terms of the sizes of adjacent critical cliques. reduction rule 2. if there is a critical clique k such that |k| > | s cbelong to n c| + 1, then reduce the size of k to | s cbelong to n c| + 1. lemma 5. reduction rule 2 is safe. proof. let k be a critical clique with |k| > | s cbelong to n c| and let {greek small letter sigma} be an optimal solution. we show that {greek small letter sigma} does not split any vertex corresponding to k and does not add or delete any edge incident to such a vertex. by lemma 3, we may assume that all cliques in g| {greek small letter sigma} contain no or exactly 3we only point out here that since we removed any operations involving w, the original edge between ri and w is not removed. moreover when splitting another vertex , then we treat each copy of w the same as the corresponding copy of ri. when splitting the jth copy of ri to create the j {prime}th and j {prime} {prime}th copies, then we keep both new vertices adjacent to the jth copy of w and when splitting the jth copy of w, then we make the j {prime}th copy of w adjacent to the j {prime}th copy of ri and the j {prime} {prime}th copy of w adjacent to the j {prime} {prime}th copy of ri. note that each copy of w is adjacent to the respective copy of ri and not adjacent to any other copy of ri . 4a reduction rule is safe if its application results in an equivalent instance. 8 one copy of vertices in k. let h be a clique in g| {greek small letter sigma} that contains exactly one copy of each vertex corresponding to k. let a be the set of nodes in n in the critical clique quotient graph c of g whose corresponding vertices have a copy in h. analogously, let b be the set of nodes not in n in c whose corresponding vertices have a copy in h. note first that we can assume b = {empty set} as otherwise {greek small letter sigma} adds at least |k| edges between a vertex corresponding to a node in b and all vertices in k. splitting all vertices corresponding to nodes in a instead results in another cluster graph reached by a shorter edit sequence as |a| {less-than or equal to}| s cbelong to n c| < |k|. this contradicts the fact that {greek small letter sigma} is an optimal solution. we next show that a = n. assume towards a contradiction that a {combining long solidus overlay}= n. then, there exists a node v belong to n a. modifying {greek small letter sigma} to split each vertex corresponding to v once, add all missing edges between vertices corresponding to v and vertices corresponding to a node in a, and removing all edge removals between vertices corresponding to k and v results in another cluster graph. moreover, the newly acquired edit sequence is in fact shorter as |v| + |v| {middle dot} | s cbelong to a c| {less-than or equal to}|v| {middle dot} {v} c| + 1) {less-than or equal to}|v| {middle dot} c|) < |v| {middle dot} |k|. this again contradicts the fact that {greek small letter sigma} is optimal. we have shown that a = n and b = {empty set}. since h contains a copy of each vertex adjacent to a vertex in k, we can assume without loss of generality that no vertex in k is split and no edge incident to such a vertex is added or deleted. since the above argument holds as long as |k| > | s cbelong to n c|, we can reduce the size of k to | s cbelong to n c| + 1 and still have an equivalent instance of cluster editing with vertex splitting. we next show that if more than 6k vertices are left after performing reduction rules 1 and 2 exhaustively, then we have a no-instance. lemma 6. if there is a solution to cluster editing with vertex splitting on , then there are at most 6k vertices and 4k critical cliques left after performing reduction rules 1 and 2 exhaustively. proof. we follow an approach similar to that taken by guo . let {greek small letter sigma} be an optimal solution of cluster editing with vertex splitting that satisfies lemma 3. let g {prime} be the graph obtained from g after applying reduction rules 1 and 2 exhaustively. partition the node set of the critical clique quotient graph c of g {prime} into 4 sets w, x, y, and z as follows. let w be the set of nodes whose corresponding vertices are the endpoint of some edge added by {greek small letter sigma}. let x be the subset of nodes not contained in w whose corresponding vertices are the endpoint of some edge deleted by {greek small letter sigma}. let y be the subset of nodes not in w or x whose corresponding vertices are split by {greek small letter sigma}. finally, let z be all other nodes in c. as each vertex corresponding to a node in w, x, and y is a {latin small ligature ff}ected by some operation in {greek small letter sigma} and each operation can a {latin small ligature ff}ect at most 2 vertices, it holds that | s cbelong to w {union}x {union}y c| {less-than or equal to}2| {greek small letter sigma}| {less-than or equal to}2k. let us now consider z. assume towards a contradiction that there is a clique h in g| {greek small letter sigma} that contains the vertices corresponding to a node in z but no vertex corresponding to a node in w {union}x {union}y or c contains vertices corresponding to two nodes in z. in the former case, let v belong to z be a node whose corresponding vertices are contained in h. by definition of z, the vertices corresponding to v are adjacent to all vertices in h . hence, none of these vertices correspond to a node in w {union}x {union}y . since reduction rule 1 removed all isolated critical cliques, v is not an isolated node and there is therefore a second node u belong to z whose corresponding vertices are contained in h. hence, we are in the second case where h contains the vertices of at least two critical cliques u, v belong to z. by definition of z, the vertices corresponding to u and v are adjacent to all vertices in h and not adjacent to any other vertices. moreover, since h is a clique and no edges incident to vertices corresponding to u or v were added by {greek small letter sigma}, all vertices corresponding to u and v are pairwise adjacent in g. note that this means that u and v are actually the same critical clique, a contradiction. hence, each clique h in g| {greek small letter sigma} contains vertices corresponding to at most one node in z and if it does, then it contains vertices of at least one node in w {union}x {union}y . this also means that the number of nodes in z is upper bounded by |w {union}x {union}y | {less-than or equal to}2k. thus, g {prime} contains at most |w {union}x {union}y {union}z| {less-than or equal to}4k critical cliques. consider now the graph g| {greek small letter sigma}. the number of vertices that are copies of vertices corresponding to nodes in w {union}x {union}y is at most 2k. by definition of z, the vertices corresponding to nodes 9 in z are not split during {greek small letter sigma}. hence, the number of vertices in g| {greek small letter sigma} that are copies of vertices corresponding to nodes in z is the same as the number of vertices in g {prime} that correspond to nodes in z. assume towards a contradiction that this number is more than 4k. then, there exists by the pigeonhole principle a clique h in g| {greek small letter sigma} and an integer {script small l}such that h contains {script small l}vertices which are copies of vertices corresponding to nodes in w {union}x {union}y and at least 2 {script small l}+ 1 vertices that are corresponding to nodes in z. let a be the set of vertices in g {prime} which correspond to a node in w {union}x {union}y and have a copy in h and let b be the set of vertices in g {prime} which correspond to a node in z and are contained in h. by definition of z, all vertices in b are adjacent to all vertices in a in g {prime}. moreover, as shown above, all vertices in b belong to the same critical clique c in g {prime}. hence, |c| {greater-than or equal to}2| s c {prime}belong to n c {prime}| + 1 {greater-than or equal to}| s c {prime}belong to n c {prime}| + 2. this contradicts the fact that c {prime} was reduced with respect to reduction rule 2. thus, the number of vertices in g {prime} that correspond to a node in z is at most 4k and the total number of vertices in g {prime} is at most 6k. the above lemma can be converted into the following reduction rule. note that a c4 is a cycle on four vertices and a c4 cannot be transformed into a cluster graph with a single operation. reduction rule 3. if there are more than 6k vertices or 4k critical cliques left after applying reduction rules 1 and 2 exhaustively, then reduce the graph to a c4 and set k = 1. based on the previous three reduction rules, it is easy to derive a problem kernel with 6k vertices in linear time. theorem 3. one can compute a kernel with at most 6k vertices and 4k critical cliques for cluster editing with vertex splitting in linear time. proof. computing the critical clique quotient graph c of g takes linear time . applying reduction rule 1 exhaustively also takes linear time and this removes all isolated nodes in c. applying reduction rule 2 exhaustively takes linear time as shown next. first, we can sort all critical cliques by their size in linear time using bucket sort. applying reduction rule 2 to a critical clique c takes deg time. by the handshaking lemma, this procedure takes time linear in the number of edges in c which is upper-bounded by the number of edges in the input graph. note that if we iterate over the critical cliques in increasing order of size, then an application of reduction rule 2 can never a {latin small ligature ff}ect previously considered critical cliques. this is due to the fact that an application of reduction rule 2 does only depend on adjacent critical cliques. since, whenever we reduce the size of a critical clique, we only reduce it to a size larger than all of its adjacent critical cliques, this can never lead to a situation where we can reduce a critical clique that was initially smaller than the current critical clique. hence, applying reduction rule 2 exhaustively takes linear time. afterwards, we can compute the critical clique quotient graph c {prime} of the resulting graph g {prime} and count the number of vertices in g {prime} and c {prime} in linear time. if the number of vertices in g is at most 6k and the number of vertices in c {prime} is at most 4k, then we are done. otherwise, we apply reduction rule 3. this is correct by lemma 6, can be performed in constant time, and the resulting graph has 4 {less-than or equal to}6k {prime} vertices and 4 {less-than or equal to}4k {prime} critical cliques, where k {prime} = 1 is the newly set parameter. this concludes the proof. we leave it as an open problem whether the size of the kernel can be improved and mention that there is a 2k-vertex kernel for cluster editing . 7",

    "Text": "the result in theorem 3 implies that cluster editing with vertex splitting is fixedparameter tractable. by lemma 3, we can assume that all vertices in the same critical clique belong to the same clique in a solution. it is easy to see that the final solution consists of at most 2k cliques and guessing these for each of the at most 4k critical cliques takes o4k) = o time. checking whether a given solution can be reached in k operations takes o time and combined with the time for computing the kernel, this results in a running time in o. this is, however, far from optimal as shown next. 10 theorem 4. cluster editing with vertex splitting can be solved in o time. proof. first, we compute the critical clique of each vertex and the critical clique quotient graph c of g in linear time . next, we compute the kernel from theorem 3 in linear time. note that c contains at most 4k vertices. by lemma 3, we can also assume that all vertices in a critical clique belong to the same clique in the graph g| {greek small letter sigma} reached after performing an optimal solution {greek small letter sigma}. let x = {s1, s2, . . . , s {script small l}} be the set of cliques in g| {greek small letter sigma}. note that x contains {script small l} {less-than or equal to}2k cliques as each operation can complete at most two cliques of the solution and reduction rule 1 removed all isolated cliques . hence, if there are more than 2k cliques in the solution, then we cannot reach the solution with k operations. to streamline the following argumentation, we will cover the nodes in c by cliques s1, s2, . . . , s {script small l}=2k and assume that an optimal solution contains exactly 2k cliques by allowing some of the cliques to be empty. next, we iterate over all possible colorings of the nodes in c using {script small l}+ 1 colors 0, 1, 2, . . , {script small l}. note that there are at most 4k belong to o4k) such colorings. the idea behind the coloring is the following. all colors 1, 2, . . , {script small l}will correspond to the cliques s1, s2, . . . , s {script small l}, that is, we try to find a solution where all nodes of the same color belong to the same clique in the solution. the color 0 indicates that the node will belong to multiple cliques in the solution, that is, all vertices in the respective critical clique will be split. since each such split operation reduces k by one, we can reject any coloring in which the number of vertices in critical cliques corresponding to nodes with color 0 is more than k. in particular, we can reject any coloring in which more than k nodes have color 0. next, we guess two indices i belong to , j belong to and assume that the ith node of color 0 belongs to sj or we guess that all nodes of color 0 have been assigned to all cliques they belong to. note that in each iteration, there are k {script small l}+ 1 possibilities and since each guess reduces k by at least one, is the last guess corresponding to one of the nodes of color 0, or the last guess in general, we can make at most 2k + 1 guesses. hence, there are at most 2k+1 = 2k+1 belong to o4k+1) such guesses. it remains to compute the best solution corresponding to each possible set of guesses. to this end, we first iterate over each pair of vertices and add an edge between them if this edge does not already exist and we guessed that there is a clique si which contains a copy of each of the two vertices. moreover, we remove an existing edge between them if we guessed that the two vertices do not appear in a common clique. finally, we perform all split operations. therein, we iteratively split one vertex v into two vertices u1 and u2 where u1 will be the vertex in some clique si and u2 might be split further in the future. the vertex u1 is adjacent to all vertices that are guessed to belong to si. the vertex u2 is adjacent to all vertices that u was adjacent to, except for vertices that are adjacent to u1 and not guessed to also belong to some other clique sj which u2 belongs to. since our algorithm basically performs an exhaustive search, it will find an optimal solution. it only remains to analyze the running time. we first compute the kernel in o time. we then try o4k) possible colorings of c and for each coloring o4k+1) guesses. afterwards, we compute the solution in o time as n belong to o by reduction rule 3. thus, the overall running time is in o8k+1 {middle dot} k2 + n + m) {subset of or equal to}o. we should note in passing that, while the constants in the running time of our algorithm can probably be improved, a completely new approach is required if one wants a single-exponentialtime algorithm. this is due to the fact that the number of possible partitions of o critical cliques into clusters grows super-exponentially even if no vertex-splitting operations are allowed. 8 conclusion by allowing a vertex to split into two vertices, we extend the notion of cluster editing in an attempt to better model clustering problems where a data element may have roles in more than 11 one cluster. on the one hand, we show that this new problem, which we call cluster editing with vertex splitting, is np-complete and, assuming the eth, there are no 2o-time or 2o {middle dot} poly-time algorithms for it. on the other hand, we give a 6k-vertex kernel and an o-time algorithm. this leaves the following gaps. open problem 1. does there exist a 2o {middle dot} poly-time algorithm for cluster editing with vertex splitting? open problem 2. does there exist a linear-size kernel, that is, a kernel in which the number of vertices plus the number of edges is in o? however, even resolving these questions should only be seen as a starting point for a much larger undertaking. while we do understand the parameterized complexity of cluster editing with vertex splitting with respect to k reasonably well, there are still a lot of open questions regarding structural parameters of the input graph. future work may also consider a bound on the number of allowed edge edits incident to each vertex as used by komusiewicz and uhlmann and abu-khzam . moreover, one might also study the approximability of cluster editing with vertex splitting as the trivial constant-factor approximation of cluster editing does not carry over if we allow vertex splitting. in case cluster editing with vertex splitting turns out to be hard to approximate, one might then continue with studying fpt-approximation and approximation kernels . the vertex splitting operation may also be applicable to other classes of target graphs, including bipartite graphs, chordal-graphs, comparability graphs, perfect graphs, or disjoint unions of graphs like complete bipartite graphs , s-cliques, s-clubs, s-plexes, k-cores, or {greek small letter gamma}-quasi-cliques. we note that the results in section 4 are directly applicable to these settings as well. especially bicluster editing has received significant attention recently . to the best of our knowledge, nothing is known about bicluster editing with vertex splitting. we should also note that there are two natural versions in the bipartite case and both of them seem worth studying. the two versions di {latin small ligature ff}er in whether or not one requires that all copies of a split vertex lie on the same side of a bipartition in a solution. on the one hand, the additional requirement makes sense if the data is inherently bipartite. this happens for example if each vertex represents either a researcher or a paper and an edge represents an authorship. on the other hand, if edges reflect something like a seller-buyer relationship, then it is plausible that a person both sells and buys. finally, we believe that it also makes sense to study a variant of the vertex-splitting operation where the neighborhood of the two newly introduced vertices are a partition of the neighborhood of the split vertex rather than a covering. that is, when we split a vertex v into v1 and v2, instead of allowing a neighbor w of v to be adjacent to both v1 and v2, we require that w must be adjacent to exactly one of the two. this operation is called exclusive vertex splitting in the literature, and can be seen to be closely related to the clique partitioning problem. acknowledgments matthias bentert is supported by the european research council

    "Text": "the standard model has been very successful in explaining almost all experimental data to date, culminating in the discovery of the the long awaited standard higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider . the most important experimental goals of the lhc, future high energy hadron colliders, and the international linear collider are to study the higgs properties and to search for new physics beyond the standard model including additional higgs bosons and flavor changing neutral higgs interactions. in the standard model there is one higgs doublet, which generates masses for both vector bosons and fermions. there is no explanation for the large di {latin small ligature ff}erences among yukawa couplings of fermions with the higgs boson. in addition, there are no flavor changing neutral currents mediated by gauge interactions or by higgs interactions at the tree level. the top quark is the most massive elementary particle ever discovered. the fact that the higgs boson is lighter than the top quark makes it possible for the top quark to decay into the higgs boson along with a charm quark kinematically. at the one loop level, the branching fraction of t {rightwards arrow}ch0 is 3 *10-15 for mh = 125 gev . if this decay mode is detected in the near future, it would indicate a large tree-level coupling or a significant enhancement from beyond sm loop e {latin small ligature ff}ects. a general two higgs doublet model usually contains flavor changing neutral higgs interactions if there is no discrete symmetry to turn o {latin small ligature ff}tree-level fcnc . in 1991, it was pointed out that top-charm fcnh coupling could be prominent if the yukawa couplings of fermions and the higgs boson are comparable to the geometric mean of their mass . a special two higgs doublet model for the top quark might provide a reasonable explanation why the top quark is much more massive than other elementary fermions. in the t2hdm, top quark is the only elementary fermion acquiring its mass from a special higgs doublet with a large vacuum expectation value . since the up and charm quarks couple to another higgs doublet , there are fcnh interactions among the up-type quarks. the down type quarks have the same interactions as those in the sm. in a general two higgs doublet model, there are five physical higgs bosons: two cp-even scalars h0 and h0 , a cp-odd pseudoscalar , and a pair of singly charged higgs boson . to study fcnh interactions in a general 2hdm, we employ the following lagrangian with higgs bosons and fermions , ly = -1 {square root} 2 x f=u,d,l {macron} f nh {greek small letter kappa}fsbeta- {greek small letter alpha} + {greek small letter rho}fcbeta- {greek small letter alpha} i h0 + h {greek small letter kappa}fcbeta- {greek small letter alpha} -

{greek small letter lamda}tch {square root} 2 {macron} cth0 + h.c. . the lhc limits for the branching ratios can be translated to a limit on the flavor changing yukawa coupling by a simple rescaling. it is a good approximation to consider a simple numerical relation between the fcnh yukawa coupling and the branching fraction of t {rightwards arrow}ch0 {greek small letter lamda}tch {asymptotically equal to}1.92 * q b . in this article, we focus on the discovery potential of the lhc in the search for the fcnh top decay t {rightwards arrow}ch0 followed by h0 {rightwards arrow}ww * {rightwards arrow} {script small l}+ {script small l}- {greek small letter nu} {macron} {greek small letter nu}. we have evaluated production rates with full tree-level matrix elements including breit-wigner resonances for both the signal and the physics background. in addition, we optimize the acceptance cuts to e {latin small ligature ff}ectively reduce the background with realistic b-tagging and mistagging e {latin small ligature ffi}ciencies. promising results are presented for the lhc with {square root}s = 13 tev and {square root}s = 14 tev as well as for future hadron 3 colliders at {square root}s = 27 tev and 100 tev, for high luminosities of l = 300 fb-1 and 3000 fb-1. section ii shows the production cross sections for the higgs signal and the dominant background, as well as our strategy to determine the reconstructed masses for the top quark and the higgs boson. realistic acceptance cuts are discussed in section iii. section iv presents the discovery potential at the lhc for {square root}s = 13 tev and 14 tev, as well as for future hadron colliders with for {square root}s = 27 tev and 100 tev. our optimistic conclusions are drawn in section v.",

{greek small letter pi} * * * q 1 -2 q 1 -2 . we assume that the total decay width of the top quark is {greek capital letter gamma}t = {greek capital letter gamma} + {greek capital letter gamma} . 5 then the branching fraction of t {rightwards arrow}ch0 becomes b = {greek capital letter gamma} {greek capital letter gamma}t . as a case study, let us take the fcnh yukawa couplings to be the

{macron} t = the invariant mass of t {macron} t, for the renormalization scale and the factorization scale . this choice of scale leads to a k factor of approximately 1.8 for top quark pair production. we have used the computer program top++ to evaluate higher order corrections. in addition, we have checked the tree-level signal cross section with narrow width approximation. that is, the cross section {greek small letter sigma} is calculated as the product of cross section times branching fractions: {greek small letter sigma} * b * b * 2 . in our analysis, we consider the fcnh signal

    "Text": "one of the most important and simultaneously most di {latin small ligature ffi}cult studies of the origin of cosmic rays is the study of their anisotropy. the di {latin small ligature ffi}culty is due to the extremely low level of the anisotropy and the steeply falling energy spectrum of cr. in their seminal book 'origin of cosmic rays' issued in 1964 v.l.ginzburg and s.i.syrovatskii could only give an upper limit of the anisotropy as < 1% . more than 20 years later v.l.ginzburg and his co-authors on the basis of data obtained by linsley j. could show that the amplitude and phase of the anisotropy are not constant, but vary with the energy . this variability is the consequence of the non-uniformity of the spatial distribution of cr sources and properties of the interstellar medium . sources of di {latin small ligature ff}erent locations and ages contribute in di {latin small ligature ff}erent energy regions and magnetic fields of di {latin small ligature ff}erent strength and orientations tend to isotropise the arrival directions of cr particles. one of the most interesting regions of the cr energy spectrum is sub-pev and pev region where the well-known 'knee' is observed. the study of this region is di {latin small ligature ffi}cult because of the very small intensity of particles and low anisotropy level. that is why there are many unsolved problems and puzzles here which still wait for their solution. below we describe only three of them. 1*corresponding author: tel +74991358737 e-mail address: erlykin@sci.lebedev.ru 1",

    "Text": "due to cr scattering on the chaotic magnetic fields their motion in the galaxy is like a di {latin small ligature ff}usion from regions of higher to lower cr density. since the solar system is located at about 8 kpc from the galactic center then the main source of cr - supernova remnants and pulsars are concentrated in the inner galaxy. the cr density is higher towards the galactic center and their gradient is directed from the inner to outer galaxy. hence we have to expect some anisotropy with the maximum flux from the inner galaxy. the expected and observed situation with the first harmonic of the anisotropy in the sub-tev region is shown in figure 1. ihe upper panel shows the amplitudes and it is seen that they do not exceed the value of 10-3. the lower panel presents measurements of the phase in equatorial coordinates. if transferred to galactic coordinates they occupy the region delimited by two dashed lines. it is seen that when the expected phase of the maximum cr flux is from the inner galaxy with {script small l} {almost equal to}0 {white bullet}, the observed phase occupies the longitude {script small l}-region between 90 {white bullet}and -90 {white bullet}, i.e. cr come preferentially from the outer galaxy. we call this phenomenon an 'inverse anisotropy'. one of the possible explanations of an inverse anisotropy is to assume that it is a local phenomenon caused by a spatial orientation of the magnetic field or the ism density fluctuation. the sun is located in the local bubble at the inner edge of the orion spiral arm. the strength of the magnetic field and of the ism density in the arm is higher than in the interarm region where the local bubble is located. the di {latin small ligature ff}usion in the nearby outer side of the galaxy is slower than locally. cr moving from the inner galaxy meet like a wall, a part of them reflect from it, accumulate in a number and create an inverse gradient . there might be an alternative explanation . recent measurements of cr at subtev - sub-pev energies demonstrated the irregular non-power law shape of the energy spectrum. as an example the spectral hardening at 200-300 gevnoticed in cream, pamela, ams-2 experiments can be mentioned, the steepening at the magnetic rigidity of 10tv in the nucleon experiment and others. the observed irregularities point to the possible role of local sources. however, to be responsible for an observed inverse anisotropy these local sources should be located mostly in the outer galaxy. we should underline that these explanations are only a possible assumption with many internal uncertainties. however, we should emphasize that the inverse anisotropy is most likely a local phenomenon, which is caused by the reflection of cr from a nearby region of higher ism density or the dominance of some local sources in the outer galaxy.",

    "Text": "in general there are several features noticable in figure 1: a good consistency of the results at energies up to a few pev; 2 figure 1: the observed amplitude and equatorial phase of the first harmonic of the cr anisotropy. data denoted as {combining enclosing circle}are taken from the survey presented in , {circled dot operator}super-kamiokande-i , {star operator}- tibet iii , {white up-pointing triangle}- baksan , {diamond operator}- andyrchi , {bullet} - eas-top . thick line above loge = 5.7 with an arrow - upper limits of the amplitude, given by kascade . here and in the text below the energy e is in gev. the full line in the upper panel relates to calculations with our model described in section 3 . the area between thin dashed lines in the lower panel denotes the region in galactic coordinates corresponding to the ra region occupied by experimental points in equatorial coordinates assuming that the observations were made at declinations about 30 {white bullet}-60 {white bullet}. 3 the extremely small {tilde operator}10-4 {division sign} 10-3 amplitude of the anisotropy; the visible rise of the amplitude a with energy e up to loge {almost equal to}4; a moderate fall of the amplitude above loge {almost equal to}4 up to a minimum at loge {almost equal to} 5.3 {division sign} 5.5; the rise of the amplitude beyond this minimum up to a few pev; the approximately constant phase at low energies which suddenly changes its direction at about the same energy of loge {almost equal to}5.3 {division sign}5.5 where the amplitude has a minimum; in the pev region, where the rise of the amplitude is observed, the phase has an apparent trend to recover up to its previous direction close to ra {tilde operator}0. in what follows we shall endeavour to build a model which can reproduce these features with the minimum number of assumptions. this model contains three basic ingredients: the galactic disk, the halo and the single source . although we separate here the role of the single source, we understand that, in fact, it is just part of cr in the disk. the details of the model suggested to explain all these peculiar features are given in . here we give just its main features and they are illustrated in figure 2. we assume that the anisotropy appears only in the vicinity of the sources, i.e. in the disk. the amplitude of the anisotropy a is connected with the cr intensity i, its gradient, gradi, and the di {latin small ligature ff}usion coe {latin small ligature ffi}cient d as a = 3dgradi ci . if the relative gradient gradi i {combining long solidus overlay}= 0 and d {proportional to}e {greek small letter delta}d then a in the disk rises with energy as ad {proportional to}e {greek small letter delta}d. the anisotropy of cr in the halo is postulated as being ah = 0 and the isotropy of cr re-entrant from the halo back into the disk dilutes the anisotropy of cr produced and trapped in the disk. in this treatment we just consider the first harmonic. later work will deal with higher multipoles. we calculate the amplitude of the first harmonic for the case where only disk and halo contribute to cr as a = adid id + ih the result is shown in figure 2b by the dotted line. the rise of the amplitude at energies above 100 gev is due to the rise of the di {latin small ligature ff}usion coe {latin small ligature ffi}cient in the expression for ad mentioned above. the slow decrease of a above {tilde operator}10 tev is explained by the rising fraction of isotropic cr from the halo, which overcomes the rise of ad. however, this scenario does not reproduce the remarkable dip in the amplitude visible in the experimental data at loge = 5.3 -5.5 and the subsequent rise of the amplitude above this dip . we think that these features, if they are real, are connected with the existence of the single source, from which the cr energy spectrum is schematically shown by the dotted line in figure 2a and denoted as 'ss'. however, this idea alone is not enough to reproduce the experimental data and here the examination of the phase of the first harmonic could help. in figure 2b it is seen that after the moderate decrease in the energy interval 0.1 - 100 tev the phase suddenly changes to its opposite. we consider this change seriously and propose that cr from the single source have a phase opposite to that of the background at lower energies. this is a necessary complementary requirement in our model. the rising part of cr coming from the opposite direction would reduce the 4 figure 2: schematic formation of the cr energy spectrum from the disk, the halo and the single source. the amplitude of the first harmonic of the cr anisotropy obtained with contributions from disk + halo + single source and the same with contributions only from disk + halo without single source . anisotropy of the background from the disk and halo as a = |adid -assiss id + ih + iss | the result of the calculations with the contribution of the single source is shown in figure 2b by the full line. a comparison with the experimental data is shown also in figure 1a by the full line. it is seen that after minimum in the dip the amplitude of the anisotropy starts rising again and it is caused by the rising contribution of the single source, which has the opposite phase. we think that the described model with three basic ingredients: disk, halo and single source is reasonable and is worthy of discussion. the new features advocated here are: the dominance of the halo component in the sub-pev region. it means that the cr which we observe and study in spite of being ourselves inside the disk come mostly from the halo. it is disputable but helps to understand the low anisotropy, small radial 5 gradient of cr intensity and small level of irregularities in the regular power law energy spectrum. the idea about the single source, which has to be nearby and young and creates the knee, usually raises questions: 'if it is nearby why do'nt we see it in the anisotropy ?'. it is a very reasonable question and this work gives the answer. the single source causes the stronger decrease and the dip in the amplitude of the dipole anisotropy at sub-pev energies. it is also seen in the change of the phase of the anisotropy at the same energies. it means that the single source should deliver cr from the direction opposite to the direction of cr from the background and it is a new assumption in the single source scenario. above the dip energy the amplitude starts to rise again with the opposite phase, as expected. the dip in this model appears as the result of subtraction of two bigger values. its position and shape are extremely sensitive to the choice of parameters participating in expression . the relatively good agreement with the experimental data is the result of the fitting procedure, but, nevertheless: it demonstrates the possibility of achieving agreement within the framework of our simplistic model and the high sensitivity of the dip to the input parameters of the expression gives the possibility of investigating these parameters when precise results in this energy region are obtained. the phase of the first harmonic in the pev region, where the contribution of the single source is big enough, could help to locate it on the sky. the present experimental data have a too big spread to make a conclusion. we understand that this scenario raises more questions than gives answers. for instance, the main questions are: do the halo and the single source really exist ? arguments for positive answers are given in the {section sign}3, but more supportive arguments are needed. why numerical estimates for cr intensity in the disk and the halo, calculated with the expression , are smaller than in the observations ? why is the energy spectrum of cr in the disk steeper than the spectrum in the halo ? according to our conception developed in the spectrum in the disk, with its higher turbulence in the interstellar medium due to sn explosions, should be flatter than in the halo where there are no such powerful sources of turbulence as sn. to what extent are the simplified assumptions about the shapes and normalisation of the disk, halo and single source spectra as well as other parameters: ad, ah and ass, reasonable and what will the more sophisticated approach do for the result ? the answers to these and other puzzling questions are the subject of further work.",

    "Text": "the existence of the single source has been proposed by us to explain the puzzling sharpness of the knee in the size spectrum of extensive air showers . the physical basis of this proposal is the evident non-uniformity of the spatial and temporal distributions of sn explosions and subsequent snr. as 6 a result one sn could explode not very long ago and close to the solar system. its contribution to the cr intensity is rather high and it gives rise to a small peak above the background from other snr - it is our single source. to search for the single source authors used the so called di {latin small ligature ff}erence metod. it is di {latin small ligature ff}erent from the traditional study of the cr intensity. its main idea is that the di {latin small ligature ff}erence between properties of eas coming from the direction of the single source and from the opposite direction should be maximum. the method is stable against random experimental errors and allows to separate anomalies connected with the laboratory coordinate system from anomalies in the celestial coordinate system. the method allows to study the whole celestial sphere including regions outside of the line of sight of the experimental installation. to search for an anisotropy authors used experimental data obtained with the gamma experimental eas array and have taken the eas age parameter as a characteristic of the eas property. the di {latin small ligature ff}erence between eas age distributions in two opposite directions was quantified by the reduced {greek small letter chi}2 value . the result of the search is given in figure 3. the maximum di {latin small ligature ff}erence in galactic coordinates has been found figure 3: two-dimensional profile of the reduced {greek small letter chi}2 of the di {latin small ligature ff}erence between age distributions of eas coming from opposite directions in galactic coordinates. at {script small l}= 277 +/- 3 {white bullet}, b = -5 +/- 3 {white bullet}. the closest source to this location is cluster vela and therefore it is a good candidate for the role of the single source, which is responsible for the knee in the cr spectrum and the minimum in the amplitude of the anisotropy. however, a firm conclusion can be drawn only if it will be confirmed by the analysis of 7 data from other eas arrays. an alternative explanation is the influence of the regular magnetic field in the area surrounding the earth especially taking into account the nearby spiral arm . the only point we should like to stress is that the e {latin small ligature ff}ect of the regular magnetic field in pev and sub-pev energies should be small compared with the e {latin small ligature ff}ect of the single source in order not to destroy the di {latin small ligature ff}usive character of cr propagation. additional asguments in favour of the dominance of the single source in the formation of the maximum di {latin small ligature ff}erence in age distributions of eas coming from the opposite directions could be the vicinity of vela source and the 'younger' age of eas coming from the direction of the maximum since magnetic fields do not change the energy spectrum of eas and their ages. in the section 6 of our paper we speculated that a minor shift of the maximum di {latin small ligature ff}erence from vela source seen in figure 3 could be due to the influence of this small regular magnetic field.",

l+l. then we call a weighted coxeter group. in this paper, the weight function l for any weighted coxeter group is assumed to be positive, that is, l > 0 for any s belong to s. 1.3. let be a weighted coxeter group and z be the ring of laurent polynomials in an indeterminate v with integer coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients. for f = p nbelong to z anvn belong to z {0}, we define deg f = max nbelong to z an {combining long solidus overlay}=0 n. complementally, we define deg 0 = - {infinity}. for w belong to w, set vw = vl belong to z. the hecke algebra h of is the unital associative z-algebra defined by the generators ts and the relations = 0, {for all}s belong to s. tsttts {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} | {z } mst factors = tttstt {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} | {z } mst factors , {for all}s, t belong to s, mst < {infinity}. obviously, te is the multiplicative unit of h. for any w belong to w, we define tw = ts1ts2 {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} tsn belong to h, where w = s1s2 {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} sn is a reduced expression of w in w. then tw is independent of the choice of reduced expression and {tw|w belong to w} is a z-basis of h, called the standard basis. we define fx,y,z belong to z for any x, y, z belong to w by the identity txty = x zbelong to w fx,y,ztz. the following involutive automorphism of rings is useful, called the bar involution: {macron}: h {rightwards arrow}h vn {rightwards arrow}v-n. ts {rightwards arrow}t -1 s . we have tw = t -1 w-1 for any w belong to w. we set h {less-than or equal to}0 = m wbelong to w ztw, h<0 = m wbelong to w v-1ztw. we can get the following facts by easy computation. lemma 1.4. for any x, y, belong to w, we have fx,y,e = {greek small letter delta}x,y-1. for any x, y, z belong to w, we have deg fx,y,z {less-than or equal to}min{l, l, l}. for any x, y, z belong to w, we have fx,y,z-1 = fy,z,x-1 = fz,x,y-1. the lowest two-sided cell of weighted coxeter groups of rank

finite and l is positive, then n is a bound for . namely, deg {less-than or equal to}n for all x, y belong to w. remark 1.6. when w is a finite coxeter group, this conjecture can be proved using lemma 1.4. in , g.lusztig proved this conjecture when w is an a {latin small ligature ffi}ne weyl group. in , j.shi and g.yang proved this conjecture when w has complete coxeter graph. in , i proved this conjecture when the rank of w is 3. 1.7. for any w belong to w, there exists a unique element cw belong to h {less-than or equal to}0 such that cw = cw and cw -tw belong to h<0. the elements {cw|w belong to w} form a z-basis of h, called the kazhdan-lusztig basis. we define hx,y,z, px,y belong to z for any x, y, z belong to w such that cxcy = x zbelong to w hx,y,zcz. cy = x xbelong to w px,ytx. these polynomials px,y are called kazhdan-lusztig polynomials. for w belong to w, i = r, j = l, we have the factorization w = x {middle dot} wi = wj {middle dot} y for some x, y belong to w. then we set ex = x x {prime} {less-than or equal to}x l=l+l px {prime}wi,wtx {prime}. fy = x y {prime} {less-than or equal to}y l=l+l pwjy {prime},wty {prime}. 1.8. using kazhdan-lusztig basis, we can define the preorders {less-than or equal to} l, {less-than or equal to} r, {less-than or equal to} lr on w. these preorders give rise to equivalence relations {tilde operator} l, {tilde operator} r, {tilde operator} lr on w respectively. the equicalence classes are called left cells, right cells and two-sided cells of w. then we have partial orders {less-than or equal to} l , {less-than or equal to} r, {less-than or equal to} lr 4 jianwei gao on the sets of left cells, right cells and two-sided cells of w respectively. for x, y belong to w, we have x {less-than or equal to} l y if and only if x-1 {less-than or equal to} r y-1. now we assume conjecture 1.5 holds and w has a lowest two-sided cell c0. it is easy to see that deg hx,y,z {less-than or equal to}n for any x, y, z belong to w, so we can define the a-function a : w {rightwards arrow}n w {rightwards arrow}max x,ybelong to w deg hx,y,w. for any x, y, z belong to w, we define betax,y,z, {greek small letter gamma}x,y,z belong to z such that fx,y,z-1 = betax,y,zvn + lower degree terms. hx,y,z-1 = {greek small letter gamma}x,y,zva + lower degree terms. lemma 1.9. let x, y, z belong to w. we have betax,y,z = betay,z,x = betaz,x,y. we have {greek small letter gamma}x,y,z = {greek small letter gamma}y-1,x-1,z-1. if betax,y,z {combining long solidus overlay}= 0, then x {tilde operator} l y-1, y {tilde operator} l z-1, z {tilde operator} l x-1, a = a = a = n, and betax,y,z = {greek small letter gamma}x,y,z = {greek small letter gamma}y,z,x = {greek small letter gamma}z,x,y. if {greek small letter gamma}x,y,z {combining long solidus overlay}= 0 and a = n, then betax,y,z = {greek small letter gamma}x,y,z {combining long solidus overlay}= 0. 1.10. in , g.lusztig gave some conjectures about the hecke algebra, which are called p1 -p15 and e p. when these conjectures hold for c0, we can study the based ring j0 of c0, which is an associative ring with z-basis {tw|w belong to c0} and multiplication txty = x zbelong to c0 {greek small letter gamma}x,y,z-1tz for any x, y belong to c0. in section 4 of this paper, we will do some calculation for j0 to study its structure when the rank of w is 3. 2. the boundness of from now on, we assume is a weighted coxeter group of rank 3 and l is positive. we set n = max i {subset of or equal to}s |wi |< {infinity} l. in , i proved conjecture 1.5 in this case. theorem 2.1. we have deg {less-than or equal to}n for all x, y belong to w. remark 2.2. in the proof of , i set s = {r, s, t}, mrt = 2, msr {greater-than or equal to}mst, w is infinite and w is not an a {latin small ligature ffi}ne weyl group, otherwise this conjecture has been proved. when msr = {infinity}and mst = 2, or msr = mst = {infinity}, the conjecture is easy to check, so i only need to consider the following three cases in . case 1: msr = {infinity}> mst {greater-than or equal to}3. {curved stem paragraph sign ornament} {curved stem paragraph sign ornament} {curved stem paragraph sign

to w|l {subset of or equal to}s j and swjy / belong to {greek capital letter lamda} for all s belong to j}. then theorem 2.1 has the following corollaries. corollary 2.3. if x, y belong to w satisfy deg = n, then both x belong to {greek capital letter lamda} and y belong to {greek capital letter lamda}. for any wj belong to m, q {less-than or equal to}wj, x, y belong to w, r, l {subset of or equal to}s j, we have deg {less-than or equal to}n -l. in particular, txwjty = txwjy. for any wj belong to m, the left cell of w containing wj is {x {middle dot} wj|x belong to w} = {y belong to w|r = j}, the right cell of w containing wj is {wj {middle dot} x|x belong to w} = {y belong to w|l = j}. proof. see . {white square} corollary 2.4. let wj belong to m, x belong to bj, q < wj. if y belong to b-1 j , l {greater-than or equal to}2, then deg < n -l for the three cases listed in remark 2.2. if y belong to uj, then deg < n -l for any weighted coxeter group of rank 3. proof. by the proofs in , we have the following tables. case 1 wj q deg wst q < wst, l {greater-than or equal to}2 0 case 2 6 jianwei gao wj q deg wsr sr {less-than or equal to}max{l, l} wsr rs {less-than or equal to}max{l,

-l in all these three cases. it is obvious when w is a finite coxeter group. we can get this inequality by when w is an a {latin small ligature ffi}ne weyl group and by when w has complete coxeter graph. now we only consider other case. if l = 0, by corollary 2.3, we get deg < n since y / belong to {greek capital letter lamda}. if l = 1, by corollary 2.3, we get deg < n since qy / belong to {greek capital letter lamda}, so deg < n -l. if l {greater-than or equal to}2, then we must in the three cases listed in remark 2.2, we get deg < n -l by . {white square}",

    "Section": "4. The based ring of c0",
    "Text": "in this section, for a weighted coxeter group of rank 3, we study the based ring j0 of its lowest two-sided cell c0. we want to calculate txty for any x, y belong to c0, but it is quite a di {latin small ligature ffi}cult problem. for wj, wj {prime} belong to m, we set pj,j {prime} = {x belong to w|l = j, r = j {prime}}. let p = , we have the following lemma. lemma 4.1. for any w belong to c0, there exists unique wj, wj {prime} belong to m, pw belong to pj,j {prime}, x belong to u-1 j , y belong to uj {prime}, such that w = x {middle dot} pw {middle dot} y. moreover, we have cw = excpwfy. let w1, w2, w3 belong to c0. we have the following decomposition as in . w1 = x1 {middle dot} p1 {middle dot} y1, w2 = x2 {middle dot} p2 {middle dot} y2, w3 = x3 {middle dot} p3 {middle dot} y3. if y1 = x-1 2 , y2 = x-1 3 , y3 = x-1 1 , r = l, r = l, r = l, then {greek small letter gamma}w1,w2,w3 = {greek small letter gamma}p1,p2,p3. otherwise, {greek small letter gamma}w1,w2,w3 = 0. the lemma above simplify our work to calculate txty for x belong to pj,j {prime}, y belong to pj {prime},j {prime} {prime}, but it is still not easy. so we assume x indecomposable at first. for x belong to pj,j {prime} {subset of or equal to}p, we call x indecomposable, if x / belong to m, and there doesn't exist wj {prime} {prime} belong to m, x1 belong to pj,j {prime} {prime} m, x2 belong to pj {prime} {prime},j {prime} m such that x = x1wj {prime} {prime}x2. then we have the following proposition. proposition 4.2. let be a weight coxeter group of rank 3 but not an a {latin small ligature ffi}ne weyl group. assume wj, wj {prime}, wj {prime} {prime} belong to m, x belong to pj,j {prime} and indecomposable, y belong to pj {prime},j {prime} {prime}, then txty = txwj {prime}y + {greek small letter delta}twjxy. if there exists y1 belong to w such that y = x-1 {middle dot} y1, then {greek small letter delta} = 1, otherwise {greek small letter delta} = 0. to prove this proposition, we need two lemmas. the lowest two-sided cell of weighted coxeter groups of rank 3 11 lemma 4.3. let x = x1 {middle dot} wj {prime} belong to pj,j {prime} and indecomposable, r belong to j {prime}. then we have x1 {middle dot} r / belong to c0 or x1 {middle dot} r belong to wjuj. proof. we assume x1 {middle dot}r belong to c0. since x1 {middle dot}wj {prime} {less-than or equal to} r x1 {middle dot}r, we get x1 {middle dot}wj {prime} {tilde operator} r x1 {middle dot}r by p10 {prime}, so l = l = j. assume x1 {middle dot} r = wj {middle dot} x2 for some x2 belong to b-1 j . we claim that x2 belong to uj. otherwise, there exists r {prime} belong to j such that r {prime}wj {middle dot} x2 belong to c0. by theorem 3.3, we may assume r {prime}wj {middle dot} x2 = x3 {middle dot} wj {prime} {prime} {middle dot} x4 for some wj {prime} {prime} belong to m, x3 belong to bj {prime} {prime}, x4 belong to b-1 j {prime} {prime} . then we have x = x1 {middle dot} wj {prime} = x1 {middle dot} r {middle dot} rwj {prime} = r {prime} {middle dot} r {prime}wj {middle dot} x2 {middle dot} rwj {prime} = r {prime} {middle dot} x3 {middle dot} wj {prime} {prime} {middle dot} x4 {middle dot} rwj {prime} = wj {prime} {prime}. since x1 {middle dot} r {less-than or equal to} r r {prime} {middle dot} x3 {middle dot} wj {prime} {prime}, we get x1 {middle dot} r {tilde operator} r r {prime} {middle dot} x3 {middle dot} wj {prime} {prime} by p10 {prime}, so l = l = j. thus, we get r {prime} {middle dot} x3 {middle dot} wj {prime} {prime} belong to pj,j {prime} {prime}. on the other hand, since x1 {middle dot}r {less-than or equal to} l wj {prime} {prime} {middle dot}x4, by p9 {prime}, we get r belong to r = r, so r = j {prime}. thus, wj {prime} {prime} {middle dot}x4 {middle dot}rwj {prime} belong to pj {prime} {prime},j {prime}, contradict to the indecomposability of x. {white square} lemma 4.4. let x belong to pj,j {prime} with j {prime} = {r1, r2} and r1 {combining long solidus overlay}= r2. assume x = x1 {middle dot}wj {prime} for some x1 belong to bj {prime}. if l {combining long solidus overlay}= j, then we have l {combining long solidus overlay}= j or l {combining long solidus overlay}= j. proof. if l = l = j, we assume x1 {middle dot} r1 = wj {middle dot} x2 for some x2 belong to b-1 j . x1 {middle dot} r2 = wj {middle dot} x3 for some x3 belong to b-1 j . then we have x = wj {middle dot} x2 {middle dot} r1wj {prime} = wj {middle dot} x3 {middle dot} r2wj {prime}. so x2 {middle dot} r1wj {prime} = x3 {middle dot} r2wj {prime}. since l {combining long solidus overlay}= j, we get x2, x3 belong to bj {prime}. thus, r1wj {prime} = r2wj {prime} and then r1 = r2, a contradiction. {white square} 4.5. now we prove proposition 4.2. finite coxeter groups don't have any indecomposable elements. if w has complete coxeter graph, see . for x, y, z belong to c0, we have {greek small letter gamma}x,y,z = betax,y,z, so we may compute txty. it is much easier than computing cxcy. if msr = {infinity}and mst = mrt = 2, we can list all the indecomposable elements and check this proposition directly. 12 jianwei gao weight function indecomposable elements l > l srst l = l srt, rst l > l rsrt the case of msr = mst = {infinity}, mrt = 2 is also easy. weight function indecomposable elements l > l rtsrt l = l rts, srt, srs, sts l > l srs, sts, srts from now on, we only consider the three cases listed in remark 2.2. we assume x = x {prime} {middle dot}wj {prime} for some x {prime} belong to bj {prime}, y = wj {prime} {middle dot}y {prime} for some y {prime} belong to b-1 j {prime} . then we have txty = x q {less-than or equal to}wj {prime} fwj {prime},wj {prime},qtx {prime}qty {prime}. when q = wj {prime}, by lemma 1.4 and corollary 2.3, we have deg fwj {prime},wj {prime},wj {prime} = l = n and tx {prime}qty {prime} = txwj {prime}y. since fwj {prime},wj {prime},wj {prime} is a monic polynomial, we know fwj {prime},wj {prime},wj {prime}tx {prime}wj {prime}ty {prime} contributes txwj {prime}y for txty. when q < wj {prime} and l {greater-than or equal to}2, by corollary 2.4, we have deg < n. so x q<wj {prime}, l {greater-than or equal to}2 fwj {prime},wj {prime},qtx {prime}qty {prime} has no contribution for txty. now we assume j {prime} = {r1, r2} {subset of or equal to}s with r1 {combining long solidus overlay}= r2. then we have x l {less-than or equal to}1 fwj {prime},wj {prime},qtx {prime}qty {prime} = tx {prime}r1ty {prime} + tx {prime}r2ty {prime} + tx {prime}ty {prime}. if deg tx {prime}r1ty {prime}) = n or deg = n, then we have deg = n, so x {prime}r1 belong to c0 by corollary 2.3. moreover, we have x {prime}r1 belong to wjuj by lemma 4.3. assume fx {prime}r1,r1y {prime},z = n for some z belong to w, then {greek small letter gamma}x {prime}r1,r1y {prime},z = betax {prime}r1,r1y {prime},z {combining long solidus overlay}= 0. by lemma 4.1, there exists y {prime} {prime} belong to w, such that y {prime} = x {prime}-1y {prime} {prime}. in this case, we have z = -1 and betax {prime}r1,r1y {prime},-1 = {greek small letter gamma}x {prime}r1,r1y {prime},-1 = 1, so precisely one of deg tx {prime}r1ty {prime}) and deg is n. similarly, we know precisely one of deg tx {prime}r2ty {prime}) and deg is n. now we claim that precisely one of deg tx {prime}r1ty {prime}), deg tx {prime}r2ty {prime}) and deg is n. otherwise, we must have deg tx {prime}r1ty {prime}) = deg tx {prime}r2ty {prime}) = n and deg < n. thus l {combining long solidus overlay}= j. by lemma 4.4, we have l {combining long solidus overlay}= j or l {combining long solidus overlay}= j. since x {prime}wj {prime} {less-than or equal to} r x {prime}r1, x {prime}wj {prime} {less-than or equal to} r x {prime}r2, we get x {prime}r1 / belong to c0 or x {prime}r2 / belong to c0 by p10 {prime}, contradict to corollary 2.3. summarizing the arguments above, we know x l {less-than or equal to}1 fwj {prime},wj {prime},qtx {prime}qty {prime} contributes {greek small letter delta}twjxy for txty. if there exists y1 belong to w such that y = x-1 {middle dot}y1, then {greek small letter delta} = 1, otherwise {greek small letter delta} = 0. we have completed the proof of proposition 4.2. {white square}",

    "Text": "an index coding problem , comprises of a transmitter that has a set of k messages {x1, x2, . . . , xk}, and a set of m receivers {r1, r2, . . . , rm}. each receiver, rk = , knows a subset of messages, kk {subset of}x, called its sideinformation, and demands another subset of messages, wk {subset of or equal to} kc k, called its want-set. the transmitter can take cognizance of the side-information of the receivers and broadcast coded messages, called the index code, over a noiseless channel. the objective is to minimize the number of coded transmissions, called the length of the index code, such that each receiver can decode its demanded message using its side-information and the coded messages. an index coding problem with no restrictions on wantset and side-information is called a groupcast index coding problem. without loss of generality a groupcast index coding problem with m receivers and want-set wk for k belong to can be converted into another groupcast index coding problem with p kbelong to |wk| receivers such that every receiver wants exactly one message. a groupcast index coding problem with k messages {x1, x2, . . . , xk} can be represented by a hypergraph h with k vertices {x1, x2, . . . , xk} and p kbelong to |wk| number of hyperedges . consider a groupcast index coding problem with k messages, m receivers each wanting one message and side information hypergraph h. let ek = belong to fk q . the support of a vector u belong to fk q is defined to be the set supp = x08 k belong to : uk {combining long solidus overlay}= 0 t . let e {subset of or equal to}. we denote u {contains as normal subgroup}e whenever supp {subset of or equal to}e. then, the minrankq over fq is defined as min{rankfq of its sideinformation hypergraph. however, finding the minrank for any arbitrary side-information hypergraph is np-hard . there exists a low rank matrix completion method to find the rank of a binary matrix which is also np-hard . an index coding problem is unicast if the demand sets of the receivers are disjoint. an index coding problem is called single unicast if the demand sets of the receivers are disjoint and every receiver wants only one message. any unicast index problem can be equivalently reduced to a single unicast index coding problem . in a single unicast index coding problem, the number of messages is equal to the number of receivers. any suicp with k messages {x1, x2, . . . , xk} can be expressed as a side-information graph g with k vertices {x1, x2, . . . , xk}. in g, there exists an edge from xi to xj if the receiver wanting xi knows xj. in a unicast index coding problem with k messages and k receivers, the sideinformation graph has p kbelong to |kk| number of edges. a matrix a = fits g if ai,i = 1 for all i and ai,j=0 whenever is not an edge of g. let rkq denote the rank of this matrix over fq. the minrankq is defined as minrankq {delta equal to}min{rkq : a fits g}. in a side-information graph, if receiver ri knows xj and receiver rj knows xi, then the vertices xi and xj in the side-information graph are connected with an undirected edge. the undirected edges in the side-information graph contribute towards cliques in the side-information graph. all the receivers which want a message symbol in a clique can be satisfied by one index code symbol which is the xor of all message symbols present in the clique. all the receivers which wants a message symbol in a cycle of length k can be satisfied by k -1 index code symbols. as finding the minrank of a side-information graph is nphard, many researchers have proposed heuristic methods to solve the minrank problem. birk et al. proposed least difference greedy clique cover algorithm to find the cliques in the side-information graph. ldg algorithm works by computing all the possible distances between the rows of the fitting matrix. kwak et al. proposed extended least difference greedy clique cover algorithm to find the cliques in the side-information graph. eldg algorithm works by computing all possible distances between the rows and columns of the fitting matrix. eldg algorithm also gives a method to find directed cycles of length three. awais et. al proposed an algorithm to piggyback a message which is sparsely connected to cycles of length k on the given graph g. for a side-information graph g with k vertices, the adjacency matrix a = is a binary square matrix of size k * k with 1 at the th position if there exist a directed edge from xi to xj and 0 else. note that an undirected edge from xi to xj implies that there exists two directed edges, one from xi to xj and the other from xj and xi. hence, in the side-information graph if there exists an undirected edge from xi to xj, there exist 1 in th and th positions in the adjacency matrix. for any positive integer n, the nth power of the adjacency matrix a gives some information about the paths of length n in the graph g. the th entry of the matrix an gives the number of paths of length n from the vertex xi to xj . similarly, the th entry of the matrix an gives the number of cycles of length n, which pass through xk. these properties of adjacency matrix were used in to give an algorithm to piggyback a message which is sparsely connected to cycles of length n on the given side-information graph g. in the given side-information graph g with k vertices, if there exists no cycles of length less than or equal to n -1 for some positive integer n, the presence of a cycle of length n can be determined by computing an. in an, if all diagonal elements are zero, this implies that there exists no cycles of length n. index coding is motivated by wireless broadcasting applications where the side-information may be a random quantity. let p be the probability that the receiver rk, k belong to knows the message xj as side-information for j belong to k. then, g is a random graph with vertices {x1, x2, . . . , xk}, such that each edge between any two vertices occurs with probability p, independently of all other edges. the size of cliques and cycles in random graphs were extensively studied in the literature. grimmett et. al. proved that as the number of vertices in g tends to infinity, the size of maximum clique in g would of 2log2 log2 with probability one. being the size of the cliques is small ), heuristic algorithms may be very useful to give a solution to the index coding problem. in this paper, we give a heuristic approach to find the clique cover and a heuristic method to convert the groupcast index coding problem into a unicast index coding problem. in a given index coding problem with side-information graph g, an edge e is said to be critical if the removal of e from g strictly reduces the capacity region. the index coding problem g is critical if every edge e is critical. tahmasbi et al. studied critical graphs and analyzed some properties of critical graphs with respect to capacity region. in this paper, we analyze properties of minrank by defining the notion of minrank-critical edges. definition 1. in a given index coding problem with sideinformation graph g, an edge e is said to be minrank-critical if the removal of e from g strictly increases the minrank of the graph g. an edge e belong to e is said to be minrank-non-critical if the removal of e from g does not change the minrank of the graph g. the computation of minrank over binary field requires the computation of the rank of 2 p kbelong to |kk| number of binary matrices of size k * k. hence, identification of every minranknon-critical edge can reduce the number of computations required to compute the minrank by half. a directed graph g with k vertices is called {greek small letter kappa}-partial clique iff every vertex in g knows atleast messages as side-information and there exits atleast one vertex in g which knows exactly messages as side-information. for an index coding problem whose side information graph is a {greek small letter kappa}-partial clique, maximum distance separable code of length k and dimension {greek small letter kappa}+1, over a finite field fq for q {greater-than or equal to}k, can be used as an index code. {greek small letter kappa}-partial clique method provides a savings of k - {greek small letter kappa} -1 transmissions when compared with the naive technique of transmitting all k messages. tehrani et. al in proposed a partition multicast technique to address the groupcast index coding problem. in the partition multicast, one divides the messages into partitions and consider each partition as a partial clique. the messages are partitioned in such a way that the sum of savings of all partitions are maximized. however, the proposed partition multicast technique is suboptimal and nphard and the required field size depends on the number of messages in the partition and the number of messages known to each receiver in the partition. throughout we assume a finite field with characteristic 2 and use the xor operation for convenience. however the results are easily extendable to finite fields with any characteristic. a. contributions the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. {bullet} we give a method to construct index codes for groupcast index coding problems which is independent of field size. partition multicast index codes is the best known in the literature for groupcast index coding problems and they do not exist for all fields. we give instances of groupcast index coding problem where the length of index code obtained by using proposed method is less than that of partition multicast. {bullet} to give a method to construct index codes for groupcast index coding problem, we develop many tools to address single unicast index coding problems. we define the notion of minrank-critical edges in a side-information graph and derive some properties of minrank, which identify minrank-non-critical edges in a side-information graph. by using the properties of minrank, we give an algorithm to convert the given minrank computation problem into a smaller problem. we give a heuristic algorithm to find a clique cover of the side-information graph. we also give a sub-optimal method to convert a groupcast index coding problem into a single unicast index coding problem. the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. in section ii, we derive some properties of the minrank of a sideinformation graph and give a method to reduce the complexity of the minrank computation problem. in section iii, we give a method to construct index codes for groupcast index coding problems which works over every finite field. we conclude the paper in section iv. in the appendix we give a heuristic algorithm to find the clique cover of side-information graph. ii. properties of minrank of a side-information graph in this section, we derive some properties of the minrank of the index coding problem. by using the derived properties, we provide a method to identify minrank-non-critical edges of a side-information graph. as the number of computations required to find exact value of the minrank is exponential in the number of edges present in the side-information graph, identification of every minrank-non-critical edge can reduce the number of computations required to compute the minrank by half. lemma 1. let g be the side-information graph of an suicp with k messages. let g be the side-information graph after removing all the incoming and outgoing edges associated with a vertex xk for any xk belong to v . then, the minrank of g is atmost one greater than the minrank of g. proof. the fitting matrix a of g is a k * k matrix. let gk be the induced subgraph of vertices v {xk} in g. let ak be the fitting matrix of gk. the minrank of gk is defined as minrankq {delta equal to}min{rkq : ak fits in gk}. the matrix ak is a * matrix which can be obtained from a by removing the row and column corresponding to xk. thus the minrank of gk can not be greater than the minrank of g. the graph g is the union of gk and the isolated vertex xk. the minrank of the isolated vertex is one and the minrank of a union of disjoint subgraphs is equal to the sum of the minrank of the subgraphs. thus the minrank of g is atmost one greater than the minrank of g. {black square} lemma 2. consider the side-information graph g in fig. 1 in which v = v {union}v {union}v and there are no edges between the vertex sets v and v . then, we have minrank + minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank + minrank + minrank. g1 g2 g3 . . . . . . . . . . . . fig. 1 proof. the fitting matrix a of g is a v *v matrix. let g13 be the induced subgraph of the vertices v {union}v in g. let a13 be the fitting matrix of g13. the minrank of g13 is defined as minrank {delta equal to}min{rk : a13 fits in g13}. the matrix a13 can be obtained from a by removing the rows and columns corresponding to the vertices in v . thus the minrank of g13 can not be greater than the minrank of g. but the graph g13 is the disjoint union of the graphs g1 and g3. hence, we have minrank = minrank + minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank. if we remove all the incoming and outgoing edges to v in g, then the resulting graph is a disjoint union of g1, g2, g3 and hence the minrank of this resulting graph is the sum of the minrank of g1, g2 and g3. hence, the minrank of g can not be more than the sum of minrank of g1, g2 and g3. this along with completes the proof. {black square} as a special case of lemma 2 the following lemma is obtained. lemma 3. consider the graph g in fig. 2 in which v = v {union}v {union}xk and there are no edges between the vertex sets v and v . then, we have minrank + minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank + minrank + 1. theorem 1. let g be a side-information graph and gk be the induced subgraph of g with the vertex set v {xk} for any xk belong to v . if xk is not present in any directed cycle in g and the minrank of gk is m -1, then the minrank of g is m. g1 g2 xk . . . . . . . . . . . . fig. 2 proof. from lemma 1, minrank of g is either m -1 or m. consider the case when the minrank of g is m -1. that is, the row and the column corresponding to the vertex xk in the fitting matrix of g are in the span of rows and columns corresponding to the remaining vertices of the graph respectively. let lj be the row corresponding to xj in the fitting matrix of g for any j belong to . let lk be in the span of li1, li2, . . . , lit for some i1, i2, . . . , it belong to {k}. that is, lk + li1 + li2 + . . . + lit = 0 the rows li1, li2, . . . , ltt and lk have 1s in i1, i2, . . . , it and kth positions respectively = a = a = a = 1). the linear dependence condition in indicates that there exist atleast one more non zero element in k, i1, i2, . . . , it positions in li1, li2, . . . , ltt and lk such that the ones in the diagonal positions gets canceled. note that a non zero element in jth position of ls for any j, s belong to indicates that there is an edge from xs to xj in g. this implies that there exists a cycle xk {rightwards double arrow}xi1 {rightwards double arrow}xi2 {rightwards double arrow}. . . {rightwards double arrow}xit {rightwards double arrow}xk. this is a contradiction to our assumption that there exists no cycle through xk. hence, the rank of g is m. {black square} lemma 4. in the side-information graph g, if xk is not present in any directed cycle in g, then all the incoming and outgoing edges from xk are minrank-non-critical. proof. let gk be the induced subgraph with the vertex set v {xk} in g. let the minrank of gk be m -1. if xk is not present in any directed cycle in g, from theorem 1, the minrank of g is m. let g be the graph after removing all the incoming and outgoing edges from xk in g. hence, the graph g is the union of gk and isolated vertex {xk}. as the minrank of an isolated vertex is one, we have minrank) = minrank + 1 = m = minrank. hence, removing all incoming and outgoing edges from xk does not reduce the minrank of g and these edges are minranknon-critical. {black square} let a be the adjacency matrix of g with k vertices. from the properties of the adjacency matrix, if at is zero, then there exist no cycles in g with length t and which contains xk. hence the presence of xk in any directed cycle can be obtained from pk i=1 ai. in pk i=1 ai, if th element is zero, this indicates that xk is not present in any directed cycle in g. hence by computing pk i=1 ai, one can identify all the vertices which are not present in any cycle. example 1. consider the side-information graph g given in fig. 3. the adjacency matrix a of g and p7 k=0 ak are shown below. the element in p7 k=0 ak is zero indicates that the vertex x3 is not present in any directed cycle. hence, from theorem 2, all the incoming and outgoing edges from x3 are minrank-non-critical. let a3 be the matrix after deleting the third row and third column of a. we have minrank=minrank+1 and we can compute the minrank of a by computing the minrank of a3. x1 x2 x5 x3

uf8fa uf8fa uf8fa uf8fa uf8fa uf8fb . lemma 5. let c be the set of vertices in any clique of size t in the graph g. let gc be the side-information graph after removing all the incoming and outgoing edges associated with the t vertices in c, i.e, gc = v c. then, the minrank of gc is atmost one greater than the minrank of g. proof. let g1 be the subgraph induced by the t vertices in the clique c in g and g2 be the subgraph induced by the remaining vertices in g. we have v = v {union}v . the minrank of g1 is one as it is a clique. hence, we have minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank + minrank = minrank = 1 + minrank {less-than or equal to}1 + minrank. the last inequality in the above equation follows from the fact that g2 is a subgraph of g. this completes the proof. {black square} definition 2. let g be a side-information graph. let ci = {xi1, xi2, . . . , xi|ci|} and cj = {xj1, xj2, . . . , xj|cj |} be two cliques in g. let vr = v . we say that the cliques ci and cj are cycle-free if there exists atleast two vertices xk belong to ci and xk {prime} belong to cj such that there is no cycle consisting of vertices only from a non-trivial subset of {xk, xk {prime}} and any subset of vr. the three examples given below illustrate definition 2. example 2. consider the side-information graph g1 given in fig. 4. in g1, an undirected edge represents a clique of size two. in g1, there exist two cliques {x1, x2, x3} and {x4, x5}. let vr = v = {x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11}. in g1, every vertex in the clique {x1, x2, x3} is having an out going edge to every vertex in the clique {x4, x5}. the vertex x1 is present in a cycle which comprises of vertices only from the set vr . similarly, the vertex x2 is present in a cycle which comprises of vertices only from the set vr . the vertex x3 is not present in any cycle comprising of vertices only from the set vr. in the clique {x4, x5}, both the vertices x4 and x5 are not present in any directed cycle which comprises of vertices only from the set vr. but, there exists a directed cycle comprising of x3 from clique {x1, x2, x3} along with x5 from clique {x4, x5} and vertices only from the set vr . there also exists a directed cycle comprising of x3 from clique {x1, x2, x3} along with x4 from clique {x4, x5} and vertices only from the set vr . hence, according to definition 2, the clique {x1, x2, x3} and the clique {x4, x5} are not cycle-free. x1 x3 x2 x7 x6 x4 x5 x7 x7 x7 x2 x8 x9 x10 x11 fig. 4: side-information graph g1 example 3. consider the side-information graph g2 given in fig. 5. the graph in fig. 5 is same as that of the graph in fig. 4, except one edge from x3 to x5 is removed. in g2, there exist two cliques {x1, x2, x3} and {x4, x5}. in the graph g2, the vertex x3 in the clique {x1, x2, x3} is not present in any cycle comprising of vertices only from the set vr. the vertex x5 in the clique {x4, x5} is not present in any directed cycle which comprises of vertices only from the set vr. there also does not exist a directed cycle comprising of x3 from the clique {x1, x2, x3} along with x5 from the clique {x4, x5} and vertices only from the set vr. hence, according to definition 2, the clique {x1, x2, x3} and the clique {x4, x5} are cycle-free. example 4. consider the side-information graph g3 given in fig. 6. the graph in fig. 6 is same as that of the graph in fig. 4, except the direction of one edge from x6 to x7 is reversed. in g3, there exist two cliques {x1, x2, x3} and {x4, x5} and every vertex in the clique {x1, x2, x3} is having an outgoing edge with every vertex of clique {x4, x5}. in the graph g3, the vertex x3 in the clique {x1, x2, x3} is not present in any cycle comprising of vertices only from the set vr. the vertex x1 x3 x2 x7 x6 x4 x5 x9 x8 x11 x10 fig. 5: side-information graph g2 x5 in the clique {x4, x5} is not present in any directed cycle which comprises of vertices only from the set vr. there also does not exist a directed cycle comprising of x3 from the clique {x1, x2, x3} along with x5 from the clique {x4, x5} and vertices only from the set vr. hence, according to definition 2, the clique {x1, x2, x3} and the clique {x4, x5} are cycle-free. x1 x3 x2 x7 x6 x4 x5 x9 x8 x11 x10 fig. 6: side-information graph g3 theorem 2 given below identifies the minrank-non-critical edges between cliques. theorem 2. let g be a side-information graph. let ci = {xi1, xi2, . . . , xi|ci|} and cj = {xj1, xj2 . . . , xj|cj |} be any two cliques in g that are cycle-free. then all the edges between ci and cj are minrank-non-critical. proof. let the number of edges between ci and cj be {greek small letter lamda}. we prove that all these {greek small letter lamda} edges are minrank-non-critical. let {small tilde} g be the side-information graph after deleting {greek small letter lamda} edges between ci and cj in g. we prove that the minrank of g can not be less than the minrank of {small tilde} g. let vr = v . let g3 be the induced graph of vr in g. from lemma 5, we have minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank + 2. we show that the minrank of g can not be less than minrank + 2. let xk belong to ci and xk {prime} belong to cj be the two vertices such that there is no cycle consists of vertices from non-trivial subset of {xk, xk {prime}} and any subset of vr. let g1 be the induced graph of the vertices {xk, xk {prime}} in g. let g2 be the induced graph of the vertices ci {union}cj {xk, xk {prime}} in g. we have v = v {union}v {union}v . from definition 2 and lemma 4, all incoming and outgoing edges from v to vr are minrank-non-critical. hence, the vertices in g1 are connected to g3 via g2. figure 7 is useful to illustrate g. from definition 2, there exists no cycle among xk and xk {prime}. hence, we have minrank=2. from lemma 2, we have 2 |{z} minrank + minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank {less-than or equal to} 2 |{z} minrank +minrank + minrank. hence, from and , we have minrank {less-than or equal to}2 + minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank. this completes the proof. . . . . . . . . . . . . xk xk0 g1 g2 g3 ci n fxkg cj n fxk0g vr fig. 7 {black square} note that definition 2 and theorem 2 are also applicable if clique ci is a single vertex or cj is a single vertex or both ci and cj are single vertices. theorem 3. let g be a side-information graph with k vertices {x1, x2, . . . , xk}. let {small tilde} g be the graph obtained from g by the following reduction procedure: {bullet} find a set of cliques {c1, c2, . . . , ct} in g such that all the t cliques partition v . note that any vertex is also a trivial clique of size one. if the cliques ci and cj are cycle-free, delete all the edges between ci and cj for every i, j belong to . then, minrank = minrank. proof. let ci and cj be two cycle-free cliques. from theorem 2, if ci and cj are cycle-free, then all the directed edges between ci and cj are minrank-non-critical. hence, the construction procedure given in the construction of {small tilde} g would not increase the minrank and we have minrank = minrank. {black square} example 5 given below illustrates theorem 3. example 5. consider the side-information graph g3 given in fig. 6. in g3, there exist two cliques {x1, x2, x3} and {x4, x5} and every vertex in the clique {x1, x2, x3} is having an outgoing edge with every vertex of clique {x4, x5}. according to definition 2, the clique {x1, x2, x3} and the clique {x4, x5} are cycle-free. hence, from theorem 2, the six edges from clique {x1, x2, x3} to clique {x4, x5} are minrank-noncritical. graph {small tilde} g3 after removing the six minrank-non-critical edges is shown in fig. 8. from theorem 3, the minrank of g3 and {small tilde} g3 is same. x1 x3 x2 x7 x6 x4 x5 x9 x8 x11 x10 fig. 8 theorem 3 reduces the minrank computation problem into a smaller problem in terms of number of edges . construction i given in next subsection reduces the minrank computation problem into a smaller problem in terms of both the number of vertices and the number of edges. a. a heuristic method to reduce the minrank computation problem in the following three steps, we give a heuristic approach to reduce the minrank computation problem into a smaller problem. we refer the following three steps as construction i in the rest of the paper. construction i step 1: let {small tilde} g be the graph obtained from theorem 3 with {c1, c2, . . . , ct} being the set of t cliques in g. these t cliques partition v = {x1, x2, . . . , xk} . note that any vertex is also a trivial clique of size one. let gr be the graph obtained from {small tilde} g after the following next two step: step 2: let {xi1, xi2, . . . , xi|ci|} be the vertices in the ith clique for i belong to . if | ci | {greater-than or equal to}2, combine these |ci| vertices into one new vertex yi. else, leave the vertex in ci as it is. step 3:now the number of vertices is equal to the number of cliques in g, that is t. if the number of directed edges from ci to cj in {small tilde} g are |ci|.|cj|, then introduce a directed edge from yi to yj for i, j belong to . otherwise, there does not exist a directed edge from yi to yj for i, j belong to . the reduction of minrank computation problem by using theorem 3 and construction i is summarized below. g {rightwards double arrow} |{z} theorem 3 {small tilde} g {rightwards double arrow} |{z} construction i gr minrank = minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank. in lemma 6, we give a sufficient condition when the minrank of the graphs g and gr are equal. the necessary and sufficient conditions that the side-information graph g need to satisfy such that the minrank of g is equal to the minrank of gr needs further investigation. for a graph g, the order of an induced acyclic sub-graph formed by removing the minimum number of vertices in g, is called maximum acyclic induced subgraph ). in , it was shown that mais lower bounds the minrank of g. that is, minrank {greater-than or equal to}mais. lemma 6. let g be a side-information graph. let {c1, c2, . . . , ct} be a set of t cliques in g obtained in theorem 3. if every pair of these t cliques are cycle-free, then the minrank of g is equal to the minrank of gr. proof. as there exist t cliques in gr and every clique requires one index code transmission, we have minrank {less-than or equal to}t. given every pair of t cliques being cycle-free, from theorem 3, all the incoming and outgoing edges to every pair of cliques are minrank-non-critical. let g {prime} be the graph after removing all the incoming and outgoing edges from every pair of cliques. we have minrank = minrank. in g {prime}, if we choose one vertex from each clique, then all these t vertices form an acyclic induced subgraph. hence, we have mais {greater-than or equal to}t. by combining -, we have t {less-than or equal to}mais {less-than or equal to}minrank = minrank {less-than or equal to}minrank {less-than or equal to}t. this completes the proof. {black square} lemma 7 given below gives the relation between the index code for gr and the index code for g. lemma 7. let g be the side-information graph of a single unicast icp. let gr be the graph obtained from g by using construction i. an index code c for the icp represented by gr can be used as an index code for the icp represented by g after replacing yi with the xor of vertices present in ci for i belong to . proof. in the icp represented by g, receiver rj wants to decode xj for every j belong to . let xj belong to ci for some i belong to . from construction i, receiver rj knows all the messages corresponding to out neighbourhood of yi in gr. hence, rj computes yi from c and from yi it computes xj. {black square} the following three examples illustrate construction i. example 6. consider the index coding problem represented by the side-information graph g given in fig. 9. in g, the vertices {x1, x2, x3} form a clique of size three and the vertices {x4, x5} form a clique of size two. in the graph g, there exists a directed edge from every vertex in the clique {x1, x2, x3} to every vertex in the clique {x4, x5} except an edge from x2 to x5. from construction i, we can combine the vertices {x1, x2, x3} into one vertex and the vertices {x4, x5} into another vertex in the reduced side-information graph gr. the reduced side-information graph gr is given in fig. 10. in this example, the minrank of the graph g is four and the minrank of graph gr is four. the index code for the index coding problem represented by gr is {y1, y4, x6, x7} and the index code for the index coding problem represented by g is {x1 + x2 + x3 | {z } y1 , x4 + x5 | {z } y4 , x6, x7}. x1 x3 x2 x7 x6 x4 x5 fig. 9 y1 y4 x6 x7 fig. 10: reduced side-information of g given in fig. 9 example 7. consider the index coding problem represented by the side-information graph g given in fig. 11. from construction i, the reduced side-information graph gr is given in fig. 12. in this example, the minrank of the graph g is three and the minrank of graph gr is three. the index code for the index coding problem represented by gr is {y1 + y4, y4 + x6, x6 + x7} and the index code for the index coding problem represented by g is {x1 + x2 + x3 | {z } y1 + x4 + x5 | {z } y4 , x4 + x5 | {z } y4 +x6, x6 + x7}. in example 6 and example 7, the minrank of sideinformation graph before and after reduction by using construction i is same. however, the reduction method given in construction i may not necessarily keep the rank same. for some graphs, the reduction procedure given in construction i x1 x3 x2 x7 x6 x4 x5 fig. 11 y1 y4 x6 x7 fig. 12: reduced side-information of g given in fig. 11 may increase the minrank of reduced side-information graph. example 8 given below is useful to understand this. example 8. consider the index coding problem represented by the side-information graph g given in fig. 13. in g, the vertices {x1, x2, x3} form a clique of size three and the vertices {x4, x5} form a clique of size two. in the graph g, there exists a directed edge from every vertex in the clique {x1, x2, x3} to every vertex in the clique {x4, x5}. but, there does not exists an edge from every vertex in the clique {x4, x5} to x6. from construction i, the reduced sideinformation graph gr is given in fig. 14. in this example, the minrank of the graph g is nine, but the minrank of graph gr is ten. x1 x3 x2 x7 x6 x4 x5 x9 x8 x11 x10 x11 x12 x13 fig. 13: side-information graph g with minrank nine in theorem 3 and construction i, it is assumed that the cliques in the graph are known. note that finding a clique cover of a graph is an np-hard problem. there exist various heuristic algorithms to find clique covers. in the appendix, we give a heuristic algorithm to find the cliques by using binary operations on the adjacency matrix. there exist polynomial time cycle detection algorithms to check the cycle among a given set of vertices . hence, given two cliques, one can

index coding problems in this section, we give a method to convert a groupcast index coding problem into a single unicast index coding problem. this method, along with the other techniques given in this paper leads to a construction of index code for groupcast index coding problem. a. converting groupcast icp into single unicast icp consider a groupcast index coding problem with k messages {x1, x2, . . . , xk} and a set of m receivers {r1, r2, . . . , rm}. let wk be the want-set and kk be the side-information of receiver rk for k belong to . in groupcast index coding problem, there are no restrictions on want-set and side-information of each receiver. theorem 4. consider a groupcast index coding problem with k messages and m receivers. let {greek small letter gamma}k be the set of receivers wanting the message xk for k belong to and {small tilde} kk = {for all}rjbelong to {greek small letter gamma}k kj. consider a single unicast index coding problem with k messages {x1, x2, . . . , xk} and k receivers { {small tilde} r1, {small tilde} r2, . . . , {small tilde} rk}. the kth receiver {small tilde} rk wanting xk and having the sideinformation {small tilde} kk. then, any index code for this single unicast icp is also an index code for the groupcast icp. proof. let c be the index code for the converted single unicast index coding problem. from c, every receiver {small tilde} rk for k belong to can decode its wanted message xk. from the definition of {small tilde} kk, we have kk {superset of or equal to} . hence, receiver rk for k belong to can decode all its wanted messages in wk from the given index code c. {black square} b. steps to construct index code for groupcast index coding problems in the following four steps, we give a heuristic approach to construct an index code for groupcast index coding problems. we refer the following four steps as construction ii in the rest of the paper. construction ii step 1. convert the given groupcast index coding problem into a single unicast index coding problem by using theorem 4. step 2. find the clique cover by using algorithm 1. reduce the given minrank problem into a smaller problem by using construction i. step 3. find the cycle cover in the reduced minrank problem by using any cycle cover algorithm. step 4. construct the index code by using the clique cover and cycle cover found in step 2 and step 3. the other method that can be used to construct index codes for groupcast problems is partition multicast . however, the partition multicast is np-hard and requires higher field size. the field size required in partition multicast depends on the number of messages in a partition and the number of messages known to each receiver in the partition. whereas, construction ii can be used to construct index code in polynomial time and this method is independent of field size. note that both partition multicast and construction ii are suboptimal in the length of index code. example 9. consider a groupcast index coding problem with seven messages and ten receivers as given in table i. the single unicast index coding problem corresponding to the groupcast index coding problem obtained from theorem 4 is given in table ii. cliques in this single unicast index coding problem can be found by using algorithm 1 and this single unicast index coding problem can be converted into a reduced index

{greek small letter lamda} z {ohm sign} fdx + {micro sign} z {ohm sign} gdx, where {modifier letter circumflex accent} m = z t 0 mds, f := z t 0 fds and g : {ohm sign}* r {rightwards arrow} = t1- {greek small letter delta} 1- {greek small letter delta} for x belong to {ohm sign}and t > 0, + {infinity}for x belong to {ohm sign}and t {less-than or equal to}0. to ease our future references, let us rewrite i as i = {greek capital letter psi}1 + {micro sign} {greek capital letter psi}2, where {greek capital letter psi}1 = {modifier letter circumflex accent} m x12z {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 - {greek small letter lamda} z {ohm sign} fdx and {greek capital letter psi}2 = z {ohm sign} gdx. the main di {latin small ligature ffi}culty in treating strongly-singular problems consists in the fact that the energy functional associated to the equation neither belongs to c1, in the sense of fr echet di {latin small ligature ff}erentiability, nor is defined in the whole space w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . in fact, when {greek small letter delta} > 1 the functional {greek capital letter psi}2 may not be proper, i.e. it may occur {greek capital letter psi}2 = {infinity}, for all u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . another di {latin small ligature ffi}culty exploited in this work is the presence of a more general quasilinear operator, which may be even nonhomogeneous. to deal with this situation, we approach the problem in orlicz-sobolev space setting. below, let us state the assumptions about {greek capital letter phi} that we will assume throughout this paper. 4 : a belong to c1, ) and {greek small letter phi} is an increasing odd homeomorphisms from r onto r; : 0 < a-:= inf t>0 t {greek small letter phi} {prime} {greek small letter phi} {less-than or equal to}sup t>0 t {greek small letter phi} {prime} {greek small letter phi} := a+ < {infinity}. let us denote by {greek capital letter phi}*the function whose inverse is given by -1 = r t 0 {greek capital letter phi}-1s-1-1/nds, t > 0. in order to {greek capital letter phi}*be a n-function, we need to require z 1 0 {greek capital letter phi}-1s-1-1/nds < {infinity}and z {infinity} 1 {greek capital letter phi}-1s-1-1/nds = {infinity}. in this case, {greek capital letter phi}*is a n-function given by {greek capital letter phi}* = r |t| 0 {greek small letter phi}*ds for some increasing odd homeomorphisms {greek small letter phi}*: r {rightwards arrow}r. about {greek capital letter phi}*, we will consider : {greek small letter phi}+ < {greek small letter phi}* -:= inf t>0 t {greek small letter phi}* {greek capital letter phi}* , where 1 < {greek small letter phi}-:= a-+ 1 {less-than or equal to}a+ + 1 := {greek small letter phi}+. as another consequence of and , the orlicz space l {greek capital letter phi} coincides with the set of measurable functions u : {ohm sign} {rightwards arrow}r such that r {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx < {infinity}and it is a banach space endowed with the luxemburg norm {parallel to}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} := inf x1a {greek small letter alpha} > 0 : z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi} x12|u| {greek small letter alpha} x13 dx {less-than or equal to}1 x1b . associated to the space l {greek capital letter phi}, we can set the orlicz-sobolev space w 1, {greek capital letter phi} by w 1, {greek capital letter phi} = x08 u belong to l {greek capital letter phi} : uxi belong to l {greek capital letter phi}, i = 1, {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} , n t and deduce that it is a banach space with respect to the norm {parallel to}u {parallel to}w 1, {greek capital letter phi} = {parallel to}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} + {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi}. the orlicz-sobolev space w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is naturally defined as the closure of c {infinity} 0 in w 1, {greek capital letter phi}-norm, under the hypothesis . for more information about the orlicz and orlicz-sobolev spaces, we refer , and . about m, let us assume : m {greater-than or equal to}m0t {greek small letter alpha}-1 for all t {greater-than or equal to}0 and for some {greek small letter alpha} > 0 such that {greek capital letter phi} {greek small letter alpha} {precedes} {precedes} {greek capital letter phi}*, that is, lim t {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {greek capital letter phi} {greek small letter alpha} {greek capital letter phi}* = 0 for all {greek small letter tau} > 0, where {greek capital letter phi} {greek small letter alpha} := {greek capital letter phi}. 5 to conclude our assumptions, let us suppose that f : {ohm sign}* {rightwards arrow}r+ is a measurable function such that f = 0 a.e. in {ohm sign}* : f belong to c for some {small tilde} a > 0, - {infinity}< f < f < {infinity}, x belong to {ohm sign}, where f := lim s {rightwards arrow} {small tilde} a-f, f := lim s {rightwards arrow} {small tilde} a+ f, : there exists an odd increasing homeomorphism h from r onto r and nonnegative constants a1, a2 and a3 such that | {greek small letter eta}| {less-than or equal to}a1 + a2 e h-1 {white bullet}h for all {greek small letter eta} belong to {partial differential}f, t belong to r and x belong to {ohm sign}, where h = r |t| 0 hds is a n-function satisfying {increment}2 such that h {precedes} {precedes} {greek capital letter phi}*and th h {less-than or equal to}h+ for all t {greater-than or equal to}t0 with 1 < h+ {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter phi}* 2 + 1, for some t0 > 0, : lim t {rightwards arrow}0+ sup {ohm sign}f t {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ = 0, : lim t {rightwards arrow} {infinity} sup {ohm sign}f t {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}= 0. before stating the main results, let us clarify what we mean by a solution of . definition 1.1 a function u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is a solution to the problem if u > 0 a.e in {ohm sign}, bu- {greek small letter delta} {greek phi symbol} belong to l1 and m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 z {ohm sign} a {nabla}u {nabla} {greek phi symbol}dx = z {ohm sign} x14 {micro sign}b u {greek small letter delta} + {greek small letter lamda}f x15 {greek phi symbol}dx for all {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . under the hypothesis , a solution 0 < u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 of the problem has to satisfy z {ohm sign} x00f -0) -f + 0) x01 u {greek small letter chi}{xbelong to {ohm sign}: u= {small tilde} a} {greek phi symbol}dx = 0 for all {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , where {greek small letter chi}{xbelong to {ohm sign}: u= {small tilde} a} stands for the characteristic function of the set {x belong to {ohm sign} : u = {small tilde} a}. next, we state that is satisfied, under additional assumptions on f and b, by showing that meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u = {small tilde} a} = 0, where meas stands for the lebesgue measure. 6 theorem 1.1 assume f satisfies , and 0 < b belong to l1 holds. if u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is such that: i) u is either a local minimum or a local maximum of i, then meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u = {small tilde} a} = 0, ii) u is a critical point of i and b belong to l2 loc, then meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: | {nabla}u| = 0} = 0. in particular, meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u = c} = 0 for each c > 0. moreover, if u satisfies i) or ii) above, then: u is a solution of problem , there exists c > 0 such that u {greater-than or equal to}cd for x belong to {ohm sign}, where d stands for the distance function to the boundary {partial differential} {ohm sign}, u solves almost everywhere in {ohm sign}if in addition bd- {greek small letter delta} belong to l {small tilde} h. about multiplicity, our main result can be stated as follows. theorem 1.2 assume {greek small letter delta} > 1, b belong to l1 {intersection}l2 loc, -, - and hold. then, the below claims are equivalents: i) there exists 0 < u0 belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 such that z {ohm sign} bu1- {greek small letter delta} 0 dx < {infinity}, ii) the problem admits a weak solution u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 such that u {greater-than or equal to}cd for x belong to {ohm sign}for some c > 0 independent of u, iii) for each {greek small letter lamda} > {greek small letter lamda}*, there exists {micro sign} {greek small letter lamda} > 0 such that for {micro sign} belong to admits at least three solutions, being two local minima and the other one a mountain pass critical point of the functional i, where {greek small letter lamda}*= inf uf8f1 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f2 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f3 {modifier letter circumflex accent} m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi} x13 z {ohm sign} fdx : u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 and z {ohm sign} fdx > 0 uf8fc uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8fd uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8fe . moreover, for each of such solutions the meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u = {small tilde} a} = 0. besides this, u solves almost everywhere in {ohm sign}if in addition bd- {greek small letter delta} belong to l {small tilde} h and if: iv) either m is non-decreasing and f = f for all 0 < t < 1 and a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}, v) or m is such that a comparison principle holds to problem and {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}-> 1, 7 then there exists {small tilde} a {star operator}> 0 such that meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u > {small tilde} a and u is a solution of } > 0 for each 0 < {small tilde} a < {small tilde} a {star operator}given. remark 1.1 about the above theorem, we still highlight the following facts: the equivalency between and holds true without assuming b belong to l2 loc, each one of such solutions given by iii) is such that u {greater-than or equal to}cd for x belong to {ohm sign}, for some c > 0 dependent on u. in , lazer and mckenna has proven that problem admits solution still in h1 0 if, and only if, {greek small letter delta} < 3 when 0 < b0 {less-than or equal to}b belong to l {infinity} and {greek capital letter phi} = |t|2/2 in . mohammed, in , considered {greek capital letter phi} = |t|p/p in and proved that the sharp power in this case is given by /. as a consequence of theorem 1.2, we are able to find a {greek small letter delta}q > 1 such that the problem still admits a solution in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 for all {greek small letter delta} < {greek small letter delta}q, where {greek small letter delta}q depends on the summability lq of b. this is the content of the next corollary. corollary 1.1 assume , and hold. if 0 < b belong to lq for some q > 1 and 1 < {greek small letter delta} < q - {greek small letter phi}+ q := {greek small letter delta}q, then the problem admits weak solution. although no answer about {greek small letter delta}q > 1 be the sharp power for the existence of solution still in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 has been provided, we observe that {greek small letter delta}q {rightwards arrow}/ as q {rightwards arrow} {infinity}and this limit is the sharp value obtained both by and for the cases {greek capital letter phi} = |t|2/2 and {greek capital letter phi} = |t|p/p , respectively. in particular, as a consequence of theorem 1.2 and corollary 1.1, we have the following. corollary 1.2 assume , , , and - hold. if b belong to lq for some q > 1 and 1 < {greek small letter delta} < {greek small letter delta}q, then for each {greek small letter lamda} > {greek small letter lamda}*given, there exists {micro sign} {greek small letter lamda} > 0 such that for {micro sign} belong to admits at least three weak solutions with the same properties as those found in item-iii) in theorem 1.2. it is worth mentioning that the above theorems improve or complement the related results in the literature both by the presence of the kirchho {latin small ligature ff}term, by the summability assumption on the potential b, the strongly-singular term and the non-homogeneity of the operator. our results contribute to the literature principally by: 8 i) theorem 1.1 unify some results on {increment}p-laplacian operator, with 1 < p < {infinity}, to {greek capital letter phi}-laplacian operator, see for instance and . ii) theorem 1.2 establishes necessary and su {latin small ligature ffi}cient conditions for existence of multiple solutions for the problem , by connecting and extending the principal result in yijing to a non-homogeneous operator; iii) theorem 1.2 extends the principal result in faraci et.al and complements the main result in , principally by considering a non-homogeneous operator, an optimal condition on the pair to existence of three solutions, a discontinuity of the heaviside type and including a kirchho {latin small ligature ff}term; iv) corollary 1.1 gives us an explicit range of variation of {greek small letter delta}, in which the existence of solution in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 for is still guaranteed. in particular, when {greek capital letter phi} = |t|p/p and b0 {less-than or equal to}b belong to l {infinity} for some constant b0 > 0, the value {greek small letter delta}q coincides with the sharp values obtained in and ; v) corollary 1.2 complements the principal result in by showing an explicit variation to {greek small letter delta}, where the multiplicity is still ensured, namely, 0 < {greek small letter delta} < p n = {greek small letter delta} {prime}, to ease the reading, from now on let us assume the assumptions , , , and gather below some functional that appear throughout the paper. {bullet} {modifier letter circumflex accent} m = z t 0 mds, t belong to r, {bullet} {greek capital letter psi}1 = {modifier letter circumflex accent} m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 -

the decomposition of the functional i into {greek capital letter psi}1 plus {greek capital letter psi}2, that is, i = {greek capital letter psi}1 + {micro sign} {greek capital letter psi}2, we have written i as a sum of a locally lipschitz functional {greek capital letter psi}1 and a convex one {greek capital letter psi}2 and ). below, let us recall few notations and results on the critical point theory for the functional {greek capital letter psi}1 and {greek capital letter psi}2. we refer the reader to carl, le & motreanu , chang , clarke and references therein for more details about this issue. let us begin by remembering that the generalized directional derivative of {greek capital letter psi}1 at u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 in the direction of v belong to w 1,

is a convex function. in particular, {partial differential} {greek capital letter psi}0 1 is named by the generalized gradient of {greek capital letter psi}1 at u and denoted by {partial differential} {greek capital letter psi}1. 10 about the functional {greek capital letter psi}2, its e {latin small ligature ff}ective domain is defined by dom = {u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 : {greek capital letter psi}2 < {infinity}} and a point u belong to dom is called a critical point of the functional i if {greek capital letter psi}0 1 + {greek capital letter psi}2 - {greek capital

differential}j2 {subset of or equal to} n w belong to x00lh x01 {prime} : w belong to {partial differential}f) a.e. x belong to {ohm sign} o . in particular, for each w belong to {partial differential}j2, there exists a unique {greek small letter omega} belong to l {small tilde} h such that {greek small letter omega} belong to a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}and {mathematical left angle bracket}w, {greek phi symbol} {mathematical right angle bracket}= z {ohm sign} {greek small letter omega} {greek phi symbol}dx, {for all} {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , iii) j {prime} 1 is of type , that is, if un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u and lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}sup {mathematical left angle bracket}j {prime} 1, un -u {mathematical right angle bracket} {less-than or equal to}0, then un {rightwards arrow}u in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . iv) if un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , then j0 2 {rightwards arrow}0 and {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter eta}n, un -u {mathematical right angle bracket}= z {ohm sign} {greek small letter eta}ndx {rightwards arrow}0, {for all} {greek small letter eta}n belong to {partial differential}j2, v) if un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , then j2 {rightwards arrow}j2, vi) j1 is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , vii) {greek capital letter psi}1 belong to liploc; r) is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous and {greek capital letter psi}0 1 is of the type . proof first, we note that the item i) is an immediate consequence of assumptions on m and properties of p. next, we present a summary proof of the other items. ii) let e j2 : lh {rightwards arrow}r be a functional defined by e j2 = r {ohm sign}fdx, u belong to lh. so, it follows from theorem 1.1 in that e j2 belong to liploc; r) and {partial differential}e j2 {subset of or equal to} n w belong to x00lh x01 {prime} : w belong to {partial differential}f) a.e. x belong to {ohm sign} o . since w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 lh = lh, we are able to apply to conclude that j2 = e j2 x0c x0c w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is locally lipschitz continuous and {partial differential}j2 {subset of or equal to} {partial differential}e j2 {subset of or equal to} n w belong to x00lh x01 {prime} : w belong to {partial differential}f) a.e. x belong to {ohm sign} o . the conclusion of the proof is a direct consequence of theorem 1.1 in and classical riesz theorem for orlicz spaces, see for instance . 12 iii) this conclusion is a consequence of item i) and the fact that p {prime} is of the type . iv) let un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u and {greek small letter eta}n belong to {partial differential}j2. since {greek small letter eta}n belong to x00lh x01 {prime}, the riez theorem for orlicz spaces implies that there exists a unique {greek small letter eta}n belong to l e h, still denoted by {greek small letter eta}n, such that {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter eta}n, un -u {mathematical right angle bracket}= z {ohm sign} {greek small letter eta}ndx. besides this, by using , h belong to {increment}2 and young's inequality, we obtain | {greek small letter eta}n| {less-than or equal to} a1|un -u| + a2 e h-1 {white bullet}h|un -u| {less-than or equal to} c), which leads us to conclude that | {greek small letter eta}n| {less-than or equal to}g for some g belong to l1, after using the compact embedding w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 {hebrew accent segol} {rightwards arrow}lh and lemma 5.3 in . as un {rightwards arrow}u a.e in {ohm sign}, the first claim follows by lebesgue theorem. to end the proof, it follows from proposition 2.171 in that there exists e {greek small letter eta}n belong to {partial differential}j2 such that j0 2 = {mathematical left angle bracket}e {greek small letter eta}n, v {mathematical right angle bracket}, for all v belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . hence, we obtain from above conclusion that j0 2 = {mathematical left angle bracket}e {greek small letter eta}n, un -u {mathematical right angle bracket} {rightwards arrow}0. v) as in the previous item, by using and dominated convergence the result follows. vi) this item is a consequence of the continuity and monotonicity of {modifier letter circumflex accent} m and the fact that p is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . vii) by items i) and ii) above, we have {greek capital letter psi}1 belong to liploc; r). besides this, we get from item iv) and that {greek capital letter psi}1 is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous. let un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u such that lim supn {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {greek capital letter psi}0 1 {less-than or equal to}0. then, and above lead us to lim sup n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {mathematical left angle bracket}x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}un, un -u {mathematical right angle bracket} = lim sup n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {mathematical left angle bracket}x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}un, un -u {mathematical right angle bracket} {greek small letter lamda} lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}j0 2 = lim sup n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {greek capital letter psi}0 1 {less-than or equal to}0, which implies the claimed, after using the iii). this ends the proof. the next lemma gives us some properties regarding {greek capital letter psi}2. lemma 2.2 assume 0 < b belong to l1. if problem admits a solution in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , then {greek capital letter psi}2 is a proper functional. besides this, {greek capital letter psi}2 is convex, sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous and {greek capital letter psi}2 {combining long solidus overlay}= - {infinity}for all 0 < u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . 13 proof first, note that 0 {less-than or equal to}g {less-than or equal to}+ {infinity}in {ohm sign}for all u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , so {greek capital letter psi}2 {combining long solidus overlay}= - {infinity}. moreover, if u0 belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is a solution of , then u0 belong to dom, which proves dom {combining long solidus overlay}= {empty set}. the convexity follows directly from the definition of {greek capital letter psi}2. finally, by the fatou's lemma, we conclude that {greek capital letter psi}2 is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous. lemma 2.3 suppose -, , and hold. then, i is a coercive functional. proof first, by the assumption and lemma 5.1 in , we have {modifier letter circumflex accent} m x10 p x11 {greater-than or equal to}m0 {greek small letter alpha} {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi} {greek capital letter phi} for all u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 with {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} {greater-than or equal to}1. moreover, by taking {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0 small enough, it follows from and that f {less-than or equal to}c1 + {latin small letter o with ogonek}|t| {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}-for all x belong to {ohm sign}, t belong to r and for some c1 > 0. thus, by the embedding w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 {hebrew accent segol} {rightwards arrow}l {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}-, which follows from the hypothesis , we conclude {greek capital letter psi}1 {greater-than or equal to}c3 x10 {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi} {greek capital letter phi} -1 x11 for all u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 with {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} {greater-than or equal to}1 for some c3 > 0. since {greek small letter delta} > 1, we have {greek capital letter psi}2 {greater-than or equal to}0. thus, after all these information and , we conclude i {rightwards arrow} {infinity}as {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} {rightwards arrow} {infinity}, that is, i is coercive. this ends the proof. lemma 2.4 suppose admits a solution in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 and the assumptions -, ,, hold. then i satisfies the condition. proof let {subset of}w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 and {subset of} be sequences such that i {rightwards arrow}c belong to r, {latin small letter o with ogonek}n {rightwards arrow}0 and {greek capital letter psi}0 1 + {micro sign} x10 {greek capital letter psi}2 - {greek capital letter psi}2 x11 {greater-than or equal to}- {latin small letter o with ogonek}n {parallel to} {nabla} {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} for all {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 and n belong to n. it follows from the coercivity of i, obtained in the previous lemma, that is bounded in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . thus, passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u. so, by lemmas 2.1-vii) and 2.2, we obtain that i is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous, which yields i {less-than or equal to}lim inf n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}i = c < {infinity}, whence {greek capital letter psi}2 < {infinity}. so, by taking {greek phi symbol} = u in , we obtain -0 {less-than or equal to} {micro sign} x10 {greek capital letter psi}2 - {greek capital letter psi}2 x11 + {latin small letter o with ogonek}n {parallel to} {nabla} {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} for n belong to n. therefore, by using the previous inequality and the lower semicontinuity of {greek capital letter psi}2, we get lim inf n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}0 {greater-than or equal to}0, 14 which leads to 0 {less-than or equal to}lim inf n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}0 {less-than or equal to} lim inf n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} x02 0 + {greek small letter lamda}j0 2 x03 = lim inf n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {mathematical left angle bracket}-j {prime} 1; un -u {mathematical right angle bracket}+ {greek small letter lamda} lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}j0 2 = -lim sup n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {mathematical left angle bracket}j {prime} 1; un -u {mathematical right angle bracket}, after applying lemma 2.1-iv). thus, lemma 2.1-iii) implies that un {rightwards arrow}u in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 to a subsequence that ends the proof of lemma. proposition 2.1 assume -, , and hold. then, any strict local minimum of the functional {greek capital letter psi}1 = j1 - {greek small letter lamda}j2 in the strong topology of w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is so in the weak topology. proof we just need verify that, under these assumptions, the conditions of theorem c in are fulfilled. since w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is a reflexive and separable space, j1 and j2 are sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous and the functional {greek capital letter psi}1 is coercive ), we just need to check that j1 belong to ww 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , that is, if un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u and lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}inf j1 {less-than or equal to}j1, then un {rightwards arrow}u up to a subsequence to conclude the proof of the proposition, in this direction, let us assume un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u and lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}inf j1 {less-than or equal to}j1. since j1 is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous, we have lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}j1 = j1 for some subsequence, still denoted by . thus, from this fact, continuity and monotonicity of {modifier letter circumflex accent} m in r+, we obtain lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity}p = p. therefore, by the hypothesis we can apply to conclude that un {rightwards arrow}u in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . this ends the proof. below, let us connect the existence of solution to problem with existence of two local minima to the functional i. lemma 2.5 suppose admits a w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 -solution, -, and - hold. then, for each {greek small letter lamda} > {greek small letter lamda}*there exists {micro sign} {greek small letter lamda} > 0 such that for {micro sign} belong to . since {greek capital letter psi}1 is lower semicontinuous and coercive and ), there exists a global minimum u0 belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 of {greek capital letter psi}1 in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 and, in particular, {greek capital letter psi}1 {less-than or equal to} {greek capital letter psi}1 = 0. if {greek capital letter psi}1 = 0, we would have j1 - {greek small letter lamda}j2 = {greek capital letter psi}1 {greater-than or equal to} {greek capital letter psi}1 = 0 for all u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , which would yield {greek small letter lamda}* {greater-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}, but this is impossible. 15 let us denote by c > 0 the best embedding constant of w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 {hebrew accent segol} {rightwards arrow}l {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ and take 0 < {latin small letter o with ogonek} < / {greek small letter lamda} {greek small letter alpha}. thus, it follows from the assumptions and that f {less-than or equal to} {latin small letter o with ogonek}t {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ for all t belong to {union} for some m > 0 small enough and m > 0 large enough. besides this, if {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} < {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime}, then we have m {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c {less-than or equal to} x10 z u {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+dx x111/ {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {less-than or equal to} {parallel to}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {less-than or equal to}c {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} {less-than or equal to}c {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime}, that is, x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c {less-than or equal to}c {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime}/m {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+. so, it follows from the above information and assumption that z {ohm sign} fdx = z fdx + z fdx + z fdx {less-than or equal to} {latin small letter o with ogonek} z {ohm sign} u {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+dx + sup m {less-than or equal to}t {less-than or equal to}m f c {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime} m {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {less-than or equal to} {latin small letter o with ogonek} z {ohm sign} u {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+dx for some {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime} > 0 small enough, which shows j2 {less-than or equal to} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {parallel to}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ for all u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 with {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} {less-than or equal to} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime}. therefore, we obtain from this fact, hypothesis and lemma 5.1 in that {greek capital letter psi}1 {greater-than or equal to} m0 {greek small letter alpha} {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek capital letter phi} - {greek small letter lamda} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {parallel to}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {greater-than or equal to}m0c {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek small letter alpha} {parallel to}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ - {greek small letter lamda} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {parallel to}u {parallel to} {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}+ > 0 = {greek capital letter psi}1 holds, whenever {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi} < {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime} with {latin small letter o with ogonek} {prime} > 0 such above, that is, 0 is a strict local minimum of {greek capital letter psi}1 in the strong topology. hence, we obtain from proposition 2.1 that 0 is a local strict minimum of {greek capital letter psi}1 in the weak topology as well, i.e, there exists a weak neighborhood vw of 0 such that 0 = {greek capital letter psi}1 < {greek capital letter psi}1 for all u belong to vw {0}. after these information and the assumption that the problem admits a solution in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , we are able to follow the same strategy of the proof of theorem 1.1 in to build disjoint open sets d1 and d2, in the strong topology, such that 0 belong to d1, u0 belong to d2 and to find {small tilde} {greek small letter omega}i belong to di such that {small tilde} {greek small letter omega}1 and {small tilde} {greek small letter omega}2 are distinct local minima of i. this ends the proof. by applying corollary 2.1 of for functional of the type locally lipschiz plus convex , lemma 2.4 and lemma 2.5, we have. corollary 2.1 suppose -, , and - hold. in addition, assume that problem admits a w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 -solution. then, for each {greek small letter lamda} > {greek small letter lamda}*there exists {micro sign} {greek small letter lamda} > 0 such that for {micro sign} belong to (0, {micro sign} {greek small letter lamda}] the functional i has three critical points, being two of them local minima and the other one a mountain pass point to the functional i. 16",

{ohm sign}and this proves . let us prove . by and property {small tilde} h-1 ) {less-than or equal to}2 {small tilde} h-1 = 2h for all t belong to r , we obtain | {greek small letter rho}| {less-than

obtain from , w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 {hebrew accent segol} {rightwards arrow}l {greek small letter phi}* - and h+ {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter phi}* -/2 + 1 that {greek small letter rho} belong to l2 loc. so, combining the fact that {greek small letter rho} belong to l2 loc together with above, the proof of follows. this ends the proof of lemma. lemma 3.2 assume -, , , and bd- {greek small letter delta} belong to l {small tilde} h. let u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 be a critical point of i and {greek small letter rho} belong to l e h as in lemma 3.1. then: x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u belong to x00lh x01 {prime}, there exists a unique representative of x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u in l e h, still denoted by x00m {white bullet} p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u, such that x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u = {greek small letter lamda} {greek small letter rho} + {micro sign}bu- {greek small letter delta} a.e. in {ohm sign}. proof of i) we have from that {mathematical left angle bracket}x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u, {greek phi symbol} {mathematical right angle bracket}= {greek small letter lamda} {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter rho}, {greek phi symbol} {mathematical right angle bracket}- {micro sign} {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter eta}, {greek phi symbol} {mathematical right angle bracket}for all {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , where {greek small letter eta} belong to {partial differential} {greek capital letter psi}2 {subset of} x10 w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 x11 {prime} and {greek small letter rho} belong to {partial differential}j2 {subset of} x00lh x01 {prime} with this last inclusion due to the lemma 2.1-. since bd- {greek small letter delta} belong to l {small tilde} h, we obtain from lemma 3.1- and that {greek small letter eta} belong to x00lh x01 {prime} as well. thus, we obtain from these information and w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 {parallel to} {middle dot} {parallel to}h = lh that x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u belong to x00lh x01 {prime}. this proves i). let us prove ii). it follows from item i) and riesz theorem for orlicz spaces that there exist a unique element in l e h, still denoted by x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u, such that {mathematical left angle bracket}-m {white bullet}p {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u, {greek phi symbol} {mathematical right angle bracket}= z {ohm sign} {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u) {greek phi symbol}dx for all {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , which implies by that z {ohm sign} x10 -m {white bullet}p {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u - {greek small letter lamda} {greek small letter rho} - {micro sign}bu- {greek small letter delta}x11 {greek phi symbol} = 0 for all {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . 20 this ends the proof of lemma. proof of theorem 1.1-conclusion. the proof of item i) is inspired on ideas from , while for the proof of ii) we borrow strategies from . the item - are consequences of lemmas 3.1 and 3.2. proof of i): we just consider the case when u is a local minimum for i. similar arguments work when u is a local maximum for i. in this case, it is readily that {greek small letter lamda} z {ohm sign} f -f {latin small letter o with ogonek} dx - {micro sign} z {ohm sign} g -g {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek phi symbol}dx {less-than or equal to} z {ohm sign} {modifier letter circumflex accent} m) - {modifier letter circumflex accent} m) {latin small letter o with ogonek} dx holds for any {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 and any {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0 given. below, let us consider two cases. first, fix 0 {less-than or equal to} {greek phi symbol} belong to c {infinity} 0 . so, we obtain from lebourg's theorem that there exist t0 belong to and {greek small letter xi} {latin small letter o with ogonek} belong to {partial differential}f such that f -f {latin small letter o with ogonek} = {greek small letter xi} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek phi symbol}, for each x belong to {ohm sign}. by using , we are able to estimate {greek small letter xi} {latin small letter o with ogonek} by | {greek small letter xi} {latin small letter o with ogonek}| {less-than or equal to}a2 e h-1 {white bullet}h) + a1 := g, where g belong to l1 is independent of {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0. hence, coming back to , we obtain x0c x0c x0c x0c f -f {latin small letter o with ogonek} x0c x0c x0c x0c {less-than or equal to}g {greek phi symbol} belong to l1 for every {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0 small enough. besides this, the right derivative of f at u is given by lim {latin small letter o with ogonek} {rightwards arrow}0+ f -f {latin small letter o with ogonek} = f + 0) {greek phi symbol} a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}, because {greek phi symbol} {greater-than or equal to}0. so, we are in position to apply lebesgue's theorem, combined with fatou's lemma and lemma 3.2, in to show that z {ohm sign} x12 {greek small letter lamda}f + 0) + {micro sign}b u {greek small letter delta} x13 {greek phi symbol}dx {less-than or equal to} x00m {white bullet}p x01 z {ohm sign} {greek small letter phi} {nabla}u {nabla} {greek phi symbol}dx = z {ohm sign} x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u {greek phi symbol}dx 21 holds for any 0 {less-than or equal to} {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 , that is, x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u {greater-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}f + 0) + {micro sign}b u {greek small letter delta} a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}. on the other hand, it follows from and lemma 2.1- that x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}f + 0) + {micro sign}b u {greek small letter delta} a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}, due to the fact that u is a critical point of i. after these two inequalities, we obtain x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u = {greek small letter lamda}f + 0) + {micro sign}b u {greek small letter delta} , a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}. secondly, let us fix {greek phi symbol} belong to c {infinity} 0 with {greek phi symbol} {less-than or equal to}0. by similar arguments as those done to prove the case {greek phi symbol} {greater-than or equal to}0, we are able to show that x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u = {greek small letter lamda}f -0) + {micro sign}b u {greek small letter delta} a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}. holds. finally, if meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u = {small tilde} a} > 0, then it would have from and that f = f a.e. x belong to {x belong to {ohm sign}: u = {small tilde} a}, but this is impossible by so meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u = {small tilde} a} = 0. this ends the proof of i). proof of ii): since u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is a critical point of i, we obtain from lemmas 3.2-ii) that x00m {white bullet}p x01 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u = {greek small letter lamda} {greek small letter rho} + {micro sign}bu- {greek small letter delta} := h a.e. in {ohm sign}. with {greek small letter rho} belong to . so, it follows from lemma 3.1 and , that a| {nabla}u| belong to w 1,2 loc . besides this, we have x0c x0c x0c x0c {nabla} x12 a| {nabla}u| {latin small letter o with ogonek} + a| {nabla}u| x13x0c x0c x0c x0c = {latin small letter o with ogonek} x0c x0c {nabla}| {nabla}u|)| 2 {less-than or equal to}1 {latin small letter o with ogonek}| {nabla}| {nabla}u|)|, which shows that a| {nabla}u| {latin small letter o with ogonek} + a| {nabla}u| belong to w 1,2 loc 22 for each {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0 given and so a| {nabla}u| {latin small letter o with ogonek} + a| {nabla}u| {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1,2 0 can be used as a test function for any {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0 and any {greek phi symbol} belong to c {infinity} 0 given. by doing this, we get from that z {ohm sign} h x10 a| {nabla}u| {latin small letter o with ogonek} + a| {nabla}u| {greek phi symbol} x11 = x00m {white bullet}p x01 z {ohm sign} a {nabla}u {nabla} x12 a| {nabla}u| {latin small letter o with ogonek} + a| {nabla}u| {greek phi symbol} x13 dx = x00m {white bullet}p x01 z {ohm sign} a a| {nabla}u| {latin small letter o with ogonek} + a| {nabla}u| {nabla}u {nabla} {greek phi symbol}dx + x00m {white bullet}p x01 z {ohm sign} a {greek phi symbol} {latin small letter o with ogonek} 2 {nabla}| {nabla}u|) {nabla}udx. since, x0c x0c x0c x0ca {greek phi symbol} {latin small letter o with ogonek} 2 {nabla}| {nabla}u|) {nabla}u x0c x0c x0c x0c {less-than or equal to} | {greek phi symbol}| {latin small letter o with ogonek}2 + | {nabla}u|)2 22 | {nabla}| {nabla}u|)| {less-than or equal to} 1 2| {greek phi symbol} {nabla}| {nabla}u|)| holds for any {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0, we are able to apply lebesgue theorem to the equalities in to infer that z {ohm sign}{ {nabla}u {combining long solidus overlay}=0} h {greek phi symbol}dx = x00m {white bullet}p x01 z {ohm sign}{ {nabla}u {combining long solidus overlay}=0} a {nabla}u {nabla} {greek phi symbol} = x00m {white bullet}p x01 z {ohm sign} a {nabla}u {nabla} {greek phi symbol} = z {ohm sign} h {greek phi symbol}dx, holds, which lead us to have h = 0 a.e. in {x belong to {ohm sign}: {nabla}u = 0}. as we already know from lemma 3.1- that h > 0 in {ohm sign}, we obtain that meas{x belong to {ohm sign} : {nabla}u = 0} = 0. so, it follows from morey-stampacchia's theorem that {x belong to {ohm sign}: u = c} {subset of}{x belong to {ohm sign}: {nabla}u = 0} for any real constant c given, which shows that meas{x belong to {ohm sign}: u = c} = 0. so, as a consequence of and above, {greek small letter rho} = f) if u {combining long solidus overlay}= a and {greek small letter rho} belong to if u = a, we obtain that {greek small letter rho} = f) a.e. in {ohm sign}. finely, by applying lemma 3.1, we have and , while lemma 3.2 implies . this ends the proof.",

    "Text": "1.2 in this section, let us begin proving the equivalences among , and . to prove , we borrow ideas from yijing , who treated this situation in the context of homogeneous operators. 23 the principal di {latin small ligature ffi}culty in doing this is to find appropriated assumptions under the n-function {greek capital letter phi} to become possible to obtain compactness results for minimizing sequences on nehari sets type, while the main obstacles to prove were already got over in the last section. the is immediately. we will end this section ensuring that the discontinuity of the nonlinearity f may be attained. let us begin by defining the set a := n u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 : z {ohm sign} b|u|1- {greek small letter delta}dx < {infinity} o and the subsets n := n u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 : z {ohm sign} x10 a| {nabla}u|2 -b|u|1- {greek small letter delta}x11 dx {greater-than or equal to}0 o {subset of}a and n *:= n u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 : z {ohm sign} x10 a| {nabla}u|2 -b|u|1- {greek small letter delta}x11 dx = 0 o . lemma 4.1 assume and a {combining long solidus overlay}= {empty set}. then n *and n are non-empty sets and n is unbounded set. proof take u belong to a. so, it follows from and lemma 5.1 in , that z {ohm sign} {greek small letter phi}| {nabla}u|dx {greater-than or equal to} {greek small letter phi}t z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx {greater-than or equal to}min{t {greek small letter phi}--1, t {greek small letter phi}+-1} {greek small letter phi}z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx and z {ohm sign} {greek small letter phi}| {nabla}u|dx {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter phi}+ t z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx {less-than or equal to}max{t {greek small letter phi}--1, t {greek small letter phi}+-1} {greek small letter phi}z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx hold for t > 0 large enough. so, we obtain from and that {greek small letter sigma} {prime} {rightwards arrow} {infinity}as t {rightwards arrow} {infinity}and {greek small letter sigma} {prime} {rightwards arrow}- {infinity}as t {rightwards arrow}0+. besides this, we have from again that {greek small letter sigma} {prime} {prime} > 0 for all t > 0, where {greek small letter sigma} := j = z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx + t1- {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter delta} -1 z {ohm sign} b|u|1- {greek small letter delta}dx, t > 0 and so there exists a unique t*= t* such that {greek small letter sigma} {prime} = 0. this shows that t*u belong to n *. as another consequence of the above information, we have that {greek small letter sigma} {prime} {greater-than or equal to}0 for all t > 0 large enough, that is, tu belong to n for all t > 0 large enough. in particular, n is unbounded as well. this ends the proof. by using similar ideas as done yijing for the homogeneous case, we are able to prove the below lemma in the context of non-local and non-homogeneous operator. 24 lemma 4.2 assume and a {combining long solidus overlay}= {empty set}. then: the set n is strong closed, 0 is not an accumulation point of n . to complete our basics tools to prove theorem 1.2, let us prove the below lemma that is interesting itself. lemma 4.3 assume that 0 < b belong to l1, and hold. let g : {ohm sign}* {rightwards arrow}r be a carath eodory function such that x00g -g x01 {less-than or equal to}0 for all s, t > 0. then the problem uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 -m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u = {greek small letter lamda}b u {greek small letter delta} + g, in {ohm sign} u > 0 in {ohm sign}, u = 0 on {partial differential} {ohm sign} has at most one solution in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . proof first, we note that the fact of m being non-increasing implies that {modifier letter circumflex accent} m is convex. with similar arguments together with the hypotheses , we show that {greek capital letter phi} convex as well. these facts and the hypotheses lead us to infer that the functional j1 := {modifier letter circumflex accent} m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 , u belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is convex as well. let u, v belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 be two di {latin small ligature ff}erent solutions of the problem . so, it follows from and the convexity of j1, that 0 {less-than or equal to} {mathematical left angle bracket}j {prime} 1 -j {prime} 1, u -v {mathematical right angle bracket} = {greek small letter lamda} z {ohm sign} x12 b u {greek small letter delta} -b v {greek small letter delta} x13 dx + z {ohm sign} -g)dx {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda} z {ohm sign} x12 b u {greek small letter delta} -b v {greek small letter delta} x13 dx < 0, where the last inequality follows from b, {greek small letter delta} > 0. this is impossible and so the proof of lemma 4.3 is done. proof of theorem 1.2-conclusion. we begin proving the first implication. 25 proof of i) = {rightwards double arrow}ii). first, we note that the assumption i) implies that a {combining long solidus overlay}= {empty set}. so, it follows from lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 that n is a nonempty complete metric space. moreover, by lemmas 2.1 , lemma 2.2 and the fact that j {greater-than or equal to}min{ {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek small letter phi} {greek capital letter phi} , {parallel to} {nabla}u {parallel to} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek capital letter phi} } we have that j is lower semicontinuous and bounded below. thus, by the ekeland variational principle there exists a minimizing sequence {subset of}n to j constrained to n such that: i) j {less-than or equal to}inf n j + 1 n; ii) j {less-than or equal to}j + 1 n {parallel to} {nabla} {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi}, {for all}w belong to n . besides this, we may assume un > 0 a.e in {ohm sign}, because j = j and if we assume that un = 0 in a measurable set {ohm sign}0 {subset of} {ohm sign}, with | {ohm sign}0| > 0, then we would have from un belong to n , b > 0 a.e in {ohm sign}and reverse h {diaeresis} older inequality that {infinity}> {greek small letter phi}+ z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx {greater-than or equal to} z {ohm sign}0 bu1- {greek small letter delta} n {greater-than or equal to} x10 z {ohm sign}0 b1/ {greek small letter delta}dx x11 {greek small letter delta}x10 z {ohm sign}0 |un|dx x111- {greek small letter delta} = {infinity}, which is an absurd. thus, un > 0 a.e in {ohm sign}. since j {rightwards arrow}inf n j {greater-than or equal to}0, we have min{ {parallel to} {nabla}un {parallel to} {greek small letter phi} {greek capital letter phi} , {parallel to} {nabla}un {parallel to} {greek small letter phi}+ {greek capital letter phi} } {less-than or equal to} z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx {less-than or equal to} {latin small letter o with ogonek} + inf n j for all n large enough, which implies that is bounded. as a consequence of this, we have that uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 un {rightwards harpoon with barb upwards}u*in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 ; un {rightwards arrow}u*strongly in lg for all n-function g {precedes} {precedes} {greek capital letter phi}*; un {rightwards arrow}u*a.e in {ohm sign} for some u*belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . by standard arguments, we are able to show that j = inf n j, that is, z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx + 1 {greek small letter delta} -1 z {ohm sign} b|un|1- {greek small letter delta}dx n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} {rightwards arrow} z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx + 1 {greek small letter delta} -1 z {ohm sign} b|u*|1- {greek small letter delta}dx holds. so, as a consequence of , fatou's lemma and lemma 2.1-vi), we obtain lim n {rightwards arrow} {infinity} z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx = z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx. 26 thus, it follows from the assumption , theorem 2.4.11 and lemma 2.4.17 in that w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is uniformly convex. this together with the weak convergence and , lead us to conclude that un {rightwards arrow}u*in w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 . after this strong convergence, we are able to follow similar arguments as done in yijing in the homogeneous case to prove that z {ohm sign} a {nabla}u* {nabla} {greek phi symbol}dx {greater-than or equal to} z {ohm sign} bu- {greek small letter delta} * {greek phi symbol}dx holds for any 0 {less-than or equal to} {greek phi symbol} belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 given. hence, it follows from the same arguments as used to prove lemma 3.1 that u*is a w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 -solution of such that u* {greater-than or equal to}cd for some c > 0 independent of u. proof of ii) = {rightwards double arrow}iii). by corollary 2.1, there exist three critical points to functional i, being two of them local minima and the other one a mountain pass point to energy functional i. so, by theorem 1.1 we know that each one of these critical point is a solution for the problem that satisfy the qualitative properties claimed. proof of iii) = {rightwards double arrow}i). let 0 < u0 belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 be a solution of . then u0 belong to dom, that is, r {ohm sign}bu1- {greek small letter delta} 0 dx < {infinity}. these ends the proof of the equivalences. below, let us prove the items iv) and . we are going to prove iv) first. let u = ua be a solution of problem . assume by contradiction that u {less-than or equal to}a a.e. in {ohm sign}for any a > 0. so, it follows from f = f for all 0 < t < 1 and a.e. x belong to {ohm sign}that ua belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 is a solution of uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 -m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u = {greek small letter lamda}b u {greek small letter delta} + f in {ohm sign}, u > 0 in {ohm sign}, u = 0 on {partial differential} {ohm sign}, that is, ua is constant in a > 0 by lemma 4.3. on the other hand, by taking beta > {greek small letter delta} > 1, we have that ubeta a > 0 can be used as a test function in and this yields the inequality betam x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 z {ohm sign} a| {nabla}ua|ubeta-1 a dx = z {ohm sign} bubeta- {greek small letter delta} a dx + z {ohm sign} fubeta a {less-than or equal to} |b|1abeta- {greek small letter delta} + c| {ohm sign}|)abeta for any a > 0 given. so, by doing a > 0 small enough we get an absurd, because the first term of the above inequality is a positive number that does not depends on a > 0. this ends the proof of this item. finally, we are going to prove v). let ua be a solution of problem . assume by contradiction that u {less-than or equal to}a a.e. in {ohm sign}for any a > 0 again. so, it follows that ua is a super solution to problem uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 -m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}u = {greek small letter lamda}b in {ohm sign}, u > 0 in {ohm sign}, u = 0 on {partial differential} {ohm sign}, 27 whenever a < 1. on the other hand, we are able to show that the associated-energy functional to problem is coercive due the assumption {script small l} {greek small letter alpha} > 1. so, by following standard arguments, we show that there exists a non-trivial 0 {less-than or equal to}v belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 solution for the problem . that is, we have uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 -m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}ua {greater-than or equal to}-m x12z {ohm sign} {greek capital letter phi}dx x13 {increment} {greek capital letter phi}v in {ohm sign}, u = v = 0 on {partial differential} {ohm sign}. so, it follows from the hypotheses that m is such that a comparison principle holds, that ua {greater-than or equal to}u > 0 for all 0 < a {less-than or equal to}1. this fact together with the contradiction assumption lead us to have 0 {less-than or equal to}u {less-than or equal to}ua {less-than or equal to}a for all 0 < a {less-than or equal to}1, which is impossible for a > 0 small enough, because u is non-trivial. this ends the proof of item v) and the proof of theorem 1.2. proof of corollary 1.1: by the implication in theorem 1.2, it su {latin small ligature ffi}ces to exhibit a u0 belong to w 1, {greek capital letter phi} 0 such that z {ohm sign} bu1- {greek small letter delta} 0 dx < {infinity}. let us construct a such one. first, we note that the regularity of the domain {ohm sign}implies that there exists an {latin small letter o with ogonek} > 0 su {latin small ligature ffi}ciently small such that d belong to c2 and | {nabla}d| = 1 in {ohm sign}2 {latin small letter o with ogonek}, where d := dist and {ohm sign}2 {latin small letter o with ogonek} = {x belong to {ohm sign}: d < 2 {latin small letter o with ogonek}}. with these, define u0 = uf8f1 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f2 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f4 uf8f3 d {greek small letter theta} if d < {latin small letter o with ogonek}, {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek small letter theta} + z d {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek small letter theta} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek small letter theta}-1x102 {latin small letter o with ogonek} -t {latin small letter o with ogonek} x112/ dt if {latin small letter o with ogonek} {less-than or equal to}d < 2 {latin small letter o with ogonek}, {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek small letter theta} + z 2 {latin small letter o with ogonek} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek small letter theta} {latin small letter o with ogonek} {greek small letter theta}-1x102 {latin

    "Text": "it has been two decades since the first convolutional neural networks was introduced in 1998 for handwritten digit classification problem. since then computer vision has matured a lot in terms of both the complexity of the architectures as well as the difficulty of the challenges they address. many works have been introduced in later years to address challenges like object recognition . however through all these years one principal issue was yet to be addressed. convolutional neural networks by its nature employ invariance of features against their spatial position. as the kernels that represent specific features are convolved throughout the entire image, the amount activation is position invariant. the activations across different kernels do not communicate with each other and hence their outputs are spatially invariant. we have intuitively developed the skill to analyze relative positions of various parts of an object. to learn these relations the capsule networks were proposed . in short capsule networks consist of a group of kernels that work together and pass information to next layers through a mutual agreement that is achieved by dynamic routing of information during the forward pass. in our experiments, our goal is to analyze the performance of these networks for some indic digit and character datasets. we have used three of the most popular indic digits dataset namely,devanagari digits, bangla digits, and telugu digits. while these have only 10 classes, the two character datasets, namely, bangla basic character and bangla compound characters have 50 and 199 classes respectively. there have been many works in indic datasets using cnns before , . in our experiments, the performance of the capsule networks are compared with respect to lenet and alexnet. to show that the capsule network learns unique concepts, we have combined it with other networks to show a boost in performance. in the next section, a refresher is provided as to the basics of a simple cnn. in section 3 it is shown how the capsule network evolves over the simple cnn along with explanations regarding its internal mechanisms. in section 4, the experimentations and results are discussed and finally concluding in section 5.",

    "Text": "convolutional neural networks are typically designed as a series of 2-d convolution and pooling operations along with non-linear activations in the middle followed by a fully connected network for classification. a 2-d convolution is performed by convolving a kernel k over an input of size cin * hin * win where hin, win and cin are height, width and number of input channels of the input . a kernel convolution on such an input should be of a shape cin *kh *kw. here cin, kh, kw are the depth, height and width of the kernel. note that the depth of the kernel is equal to the input number of channels. if we use cout number of such kernels, then the output tensor generated shall be of the shape cout * hout * wout. the height hout and width wout are dependent on factors like input height hin, input width win, stride of the kernel and the padding of the input. convolutions are typically followed by non-linear activations such as a sigmoid, tanh, or a rectified linear units. pooling operations normally take a small region of the input and compresses it to a single value by taking either maximum or average of the corresponding activations. this reduces the size of the activation maps. hence when kernels convolve over this tensor, it actually corresponds to a larger area in the original image. after a series of convolutions, activations and pooling, we obtain a tensor signifying the extracted features of the image. this tensor is flattened to form a linear vector of shape c {prime} {prime} *h {prime} {prime} *w {prime} {prime} * 1, which can be fed as an input to a fully connected network. here c {prime} {prime}, h {prime} {prime} and w {prime} {prime} are the depth, height, and width of the tensor to be flattened. the total number of neurons in this layer nf c is arxiv:1901.00166v1 1 jan 2019 fig. 1. a schematic diagram of a sample convolutional network(pooling layers omitted to keep the architecture analogous with respect to fig 2. c {prime} {prime}*h {prime} {prime}*w {prime} {prime}. at the end of the fully connected network we get a vector of size nclass*1 that corresponds to the output layer. a loss such as mean-square error, or cross entropy, or negative log likelihood is computed which is then back-propagated to update the weights using optimizers like stochastic gradient descent or adaptive moments. a schematic diagram is shown in fig.1, with a typical convolution operation followed by a fully connected layer to perform classification. layers such as pooling and non-linearities are not shown to keep simplicity and to keep the diagram analogous to fig. 2.",

    "Text": "the primary concern with cnns are that the different kernels work independently. if two kernels are trained to activate for two specific parts of an object they will generate the same amount activations irrespective of the relative positions of the object. capsule networks brings a factor of agreement between kernels in the equation. subsequent layers receive higher activations when kernels corresponding to different parts of the object agree with the general consensus. the capsule network proposed in consist of two different capsule layers. a primary capsule layer that groups convolutions to work together as a capsule unit. this is followed by a digit capsule layer that is obtained by calculating agreement among different capsules through dynamic routing. a schematic diagram of capsule network is provided in fig. 2. the diagram does not represent the actual architecture proposed in the original work , rather it demonstrates a primary and digit capsule layer. the diagram drawn is kept analogous to a typical cnn shown in fig.1 to highlight the major differences. a. primary capsules the capsule network starts with typical convolution layer that converts the input image into a block of activations. this tensor is fed as an input into the primary capsule layer. if the number of channels in this input is cin and the desired dimension of primary capsules is dp c then the shape of one kernel is dp c * cin * kh * kw. kh and kw are the height and width of the kernel. with cout number of such kernels we shall get an output of shape cout*dp c *hout*wout, where the height hout and width wout is dependent on factors like input height hin, input width win, stride of the kernel and the padding of the input. unlike normal convolutions, where each activation tensor had a depth of 1, the depth of the activations in primary capsules is dp c. the total number of primary capsules np c is cout *h {prime} *w {prime}. before passing to the next layer this tensor is reshaped into np c * dp c. b. digit capsules normally output layers in a fully connected network is of the shape nclass * 1, where nclass is the number of classes. the capsule network replaced the output layers with a digit capsule layer. each class is represented by a capsule of dimension ddc. hence we get a digit capsule block of shape nclass * ddc. by calculating the l2 norm of each row we get our output layer of shape nclass * 1. the values of digit capsules are calculated by dynamic routing between primary capsules. c. dynamic routing the dynamic routing is computed to obtain the digit capsules from the primary capsules. two different types of weights are required to perform dynamic routing. firstly we need the weights to calculate individual opinions of every capsule. these weights, w dc are normally trained using back-propagation. if i belong to is the index of the primary capsules of dp c dimension and j belong to is the index of the digit capsules of ddc dimension. w dc ij is of shape dp c * ddc. the individual opinion of i regarding the digit capsule j is given by, {modifier letter circumflex accent} uj|i = uiw dc ij , where ui is the i -th primary capsule. so for each capsule i we get an individual digit capsule block of shape nclass * ddc. the second type of weight can be called the routing weights . the routing weights are used to combine these individual digit capsules to form the final digit capsules. fig. 2. a schematic diagram of capsule network demonstrating primary and digit capsule layers. these routing weights are updated on during the forward pass based on how much the individual digit capsules agree with the combined one. the routing weight matrix w dr is of the shape of np c *nclass. during each forward pass the routing weights are first initialized as zeros. the coupling coefficients cij is given by, cij = exp p k exp. the coupling coefficients are used to combine the individual digit capsules and form the combined digit capsule. the j-th combined digit capsule sj is given by, sj = x i cij {modifier letter circumflex accent} uj|i a squashing function stretches the values of sj such that bigger values go close to one and lower values go close to zero. the squashed combined digit capsule vj is given by, vj = ||sj||2 1 + ||sj||2 sj ||sj||. the agreement between individual digit capsules {modifier letter circumflex accent} uj|i and the squashed combined digit capsules vj can be calculated using a simple dot product. the more the value of the agreement the more preference is awarded to the corresponding capsule i in the next routing iteration. this is obtained by updating the w dr ij as, w dr ij = w dr ij + {modifier letter circumflex accent} uj|i.vj. equations 2-4 are repeated for a specific number of routing iterations to perform iterative dynamic routing of opinions of primary capsules to form the digit capsule. d. loss function the loss function used for capsule networks is a marginal loss for the existence of a digit. the marginal loss for digit k is given by, lk = tk max2+ {greek small letter lamda} max2. here, tk = 1 iff a digit of class k is present. the upper and lower bounds m+ and m-are set to 0.9 and 0.1 respectively. {greek small letter lamda} is set as 0.5 e. regularization proper regularization of a network is essential to stop models from over-fitting the data. in case of capsule networks a parallel decoder network is connected with the obtained digit capsules as its input. the decoder tries to reconstruct the input image. a reconstruction loss is also minimized along with margin loss so that the network does not over-fit the training set. however the reconstruction loss is scaled down by a factor of 0.0005 so that the margin loss is not dominated.",

    "Text": "our experiments focus on the implementation of capsule networks for handwritten indic digits and character databases. the results have been compared with other famous cnn architectures like lenet and alexnet. while lenet was built for smaller problems like digit classification, alexnet was intended for much more complicated data like the imagenet. the input image is resized to the native size supported by the network that is 28*28 for capsule networks, 32*32 for lenet and 227*227 for alexnet. in total 7 models have been tested on 5 datasets. firstly, the basic lenet, alexnet and capsule network was tested. second set of experiments involved an ensemble of two of the three networks using a probabilistic averaging. finally all the three networks were combined by averaging the output probability distribution. all the results are tabulated in table 2. fig. 3. test accuracy vs number of training epochs for character datasets. a. datasets we have used five datasets for our experiments. firstly we have indic handwritten digit databases 1 in three scripts that is bangla, devanagari and telugu. these are a typical 10 class problems to primarily challenge the performance of lenet. subsequently, the character databases namely, bangla basic characters and bangla compound characters give us a 50 class and a 199 class problem to deal with. the description of the datasets are given below. all the datasets were split into train and test set in the ratio 2:1. the accuracies provided are with respect to the best model in terms of training accuracy. b. architecture and hyperparameters the capsule network has been used as it has been proposed in . the performance is compared with respect to lenet and alexnet. the specifics of the capsule network architecture is provided in table 1. the lenet was primarily built for mnist digit classification with only around 61k trainable parameters. the alexnet has around 57 million trainable parameters so that it can tackle harder problems. like lenet, the capsule network was also proposed for mnist digit classification, however it is much more robust. it has around 8.2 million parameters out of which around 11k parameters are trained on the runtime by dynamic routing. all the provided statistics is with respect to a single channel input of native input size and a 10 class output. all networks are optimized with adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001, eps of 1e-08 and beta values as 0.9 and 0.999. the experiments were carried out using a nvidia quadro p5000 with 2560 cuda cores and 16 gb of vram. 1https://code.google.com/archive/p/cmaterdb/ c. result and analysis the result of the experiments have been tabulated in table 2. it can be clearly seen that capsule networks surpasses lenet in case of every dataset used. alexnet being almost 7 times larger network as compared to capsule networks performs better than capsule networks. however the difference in performance is much more visible in case of the character datasets with much higher number of classes as compared to digits. lenet fail poorly for the character datasets. capsule network proved to be much more robust against complex data with higher number of classes. upon combination we can see that combining lenet with alexnet is detrimental in nature with respect to alexnet alone for every dataset. however combining capsule networks have always shown a positive effect. this proves that capsule network are capable of extracting some information that even alexnet fails to obtain. for most datasets the best performance was achieved by combining alexnet with capsule networks except for telugu digits, where combination of all three networks proved to be the best. furthermore we have analyzed the rise of test accuracy with every epoch of training. it can be seen that the capsule networks have the steepest slope signifying that they have the fastest learning curve. finally in table 3 we have compared the obtained result against some state of the art works performed on the datasets. in terms of computational complexity, the extra computational overhead is during the dynamic routing phase. other than training w dc by backpropagation, for every sample the routing weights w dc must also be tuned for riter times, where riter is the number of routing iterations. during each iteration np c *nclass number of coupling coefficients must be calculated. further an weighted sum over np c dimension is needed to compute the combined digit capsule. finally np c *nclass number of routing weights must be tuned using agreement of individual and combined digit capsules. with all these, capsule networks generally have quite slow iterations, table i specifications for the capsule network with respect to a

    "Text": "recommender systems are playing an important role in our life. with the emergence of various online services, people are now getting used to engaging on different platforms simultaneously in order to meet their increasing diverse information needs . the complementary information from various platforms jointly reflects user interests and preferences, providing us with a great opportunity to tackle the data sparsity problem and improve the recommendation accuracy through associating information across *corresponding author platforms. in order to improve user experience and increase user adoption, many online service providers release new features to encourage cross-platform data associations. for example, google+ encourages users to share their homepages on other platforms, enabling different accounts of the same person to be linked together. to date, quite a number of various platforms tend to associate with each other, which provides chances for cross-platform information transfer and association analysis possible. existing cross-platform recommendation works try to improve their cross-platform performances mainly by investigating the ablity of cross-platform association. yan et al. propose a user-centric topic association framework to map cross-platform data in a common latent space . they then introduce a predefined micro-level metric to adaptively weight data while doing the data integration . man et al. propose an embedding and mapping framework, emcdr, to represent and associate users across different platforms . however, existing works on cross-platform video recommendation ignore the inconsistencies in crossplatform association and differences in semantic granularities, two challenging phenomena discovered in this paper. the first challenge, inconsistency in cross-platform association, results in a reconsideration for the current assumption that all cross-platform information of the same user is consistent and can be aligned, which will be empirically validated on a real-world cross-platform dataset later. our discovery demonstrates that the inconsistency is mainly caused by the platform-specific disparity, i.e, in addition to a user's inherent personal preferences, its interests shown on different platforms also contain platform-specific factors due to different focuses of various platforms. the second challenge is that different platforms may have different semantic granularities. take twitter and youtube as an example, tags on twitter are mainly hot event topics, which are generally finer-grained than video categories on youtube. as such, a good crossplatform video recommendation model based on the correlated information across platforms should have the ability to reveal characteristics at different semantic granularities. to address these challenges, we propose the disparitypreserved deep cross-platform association model for cross-platform recommendation, which employs a partiallyconnected multi-modal autoencoder to explicitly capture and preserve platform-specific disparities in latent representaarxiv:1901.00171v2 12 nov 2019 tion. besides, we also introduce nonlinear mapping function, which is superior to their linear competitors in terms of handling granularity difference. to validate the advantages of our proposed dca model, we further design a cross-platform video recommendation approach based on the proposed dca model, which is capable of automatically targeting and transferring useful cross-platform information from a comprehensive semantic level. the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: {bullet} we recognize the inconsistency phenomenon, which is caused by platform-specific disparity, as well as the granularity difference problem in cross-platform association. {bullet} we propose a novel disparity-preserved deep crossplatform association model for cross-platform recommendation through employing a modified multimodal autoencoder, which is able to handle the crossplatform inconsistency issue by preserving the platformspecific disparities and solve the granularity difference problem via nonlinear functions. {bullet} we present a cross-platform video recommendation approach based on the proposed dca model to test its effectiveness compared with other approaches. {bullet} we conduct experiments on a real-world cross-platform dataset on twitter and youtube to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed dca model over several state-ofthe-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics.",

    "Text": "existing cross-platform recommendation works can be categorized in two ways. categorization by what to associate. one option is to take advantage of different platform characteristics towards collaborative applications. particularly, qian et al. propose a generic cross-domain collaborative learning framework based on nonparametric bayesian dictionary learning model for cross-domain data analysis . min et al. propose a cross-platform multi-modal topic model which is capable of differentiating topics and aligning modalities . an alternative option is to associate in a user-centric way, which focuses on integrating multiple sources of overlapped user's activities. in particaular, xptrans optimally bridges different platforms through exploiting the information from a small number of overlapped crowds. yan et al. propose an overlapped user-centric topic association framework based on latent attribute sparse coding, and prove that bridging information from different platforms in common latent space outperforms explicit matrix-oriented transfer . man et al. propose an embedding and mapping framework, emcdr, where user representations on different platforms are first learnt through matrix factorization and then mapped via multi-layer perceptron . although the user-centric works above are based on different premises, they share the same core idea that all cross-platform information is consistent and should be aligned. however, several works have pointed out the data inconsistency phenomenon in cross-platform data association, and attempted to solve this user groups clustered on twitter user groups clustered on youtube figure 1: visualization of users on twitter and youtube in the casia-crossosn subset. orange and purple dots represent two groups of aligned users across platforms. concentrated areas are circled with dashed lines. problem by data selection. to be concrete, lu et al. find that selecting consistent auxiliary data is important for crossdomain collaborative filtering . they propose a novel criterion to assesses the degree of consistency, and embed it into a boosting framework to selectively transfer knowledge. yan et al. divide users into three groups and introduce a predefined micro-level user-specific metric to adaptively weight data while integrating information across platforms . our proposed dca model associates information from different platforms in the user-centric way. categorization by entire model structure. one group of methods build the model in a unified framework, where the former two works adopt matrix factorization and the latter two employ the probabilistic models. another group of works adopt a two-step framework. these works first map users from different platforms into corresponding latent spaces for representations, and then associate these representations. our proposed model in this work utilizes the two-step structure in a topic-based way.",

    "Text": "to validate the existence of the inconsistency, we first visualize users in casia-crossosn, a cross-platform dataset linking user accounts between youtube and twitter , following three steps as follows. 1) for users who engage in both twitter and youtube, we extract their interest representations by latent dirichlet allocation . 2) we adopt the interest representations as inputs to the visualization tool tsne so that users are represented as two-dimensional vectors and visualized as dots {em dash} the platform average euclidean distance from center of user groups random

groups clustered on twitter no longer concentrate on youtube , indicating cross-platform user interest disparity. closer two dots are in distance, the more similar their corresponding users are in topic space. 3) we cluster users into different groups by their twitter interest representations, select two groups, and mark them with orange and purple respectively in figure 1 such that users who share a same color are regarded as similar. we observe from figure 1 that only a part of users who are similar on twitter still stay similar on youtube and the rest actually becomes quite different. moreover, in figure 1, orange user group clustered on youtube splits into two subset on twitter, indicating that two platforms may have different semantic granularities. in addition to visualizing the interest representations, table 1 further confirms the existence of the inconsistency phenomenon through a measurement study on casiacrossosn. i) for each clustered user group on twitter and youtube, we calculate the average euclidean distance from the group center to group members. ii) we do the same thing for randomly sampled groups on both platforms and use the calculated average euclidean distances as normalizers to obtain the concentration ratio such that a larger concentration ratio indicates a less clustered pattern. it can be observed from table 1 that when we cluster users by their interest representations on twitter , the concentration ratio is small on the origin platform while becomes quite large on the other platform, indicating that users having similar interests on one platform tend to behave quite similarly to randomly sampled users on the other {em dash} they no longer share similar interests. we close this section by giving a conclusion on the existence of inconsistency in cross-platform association: users' interests on different platforms may be diverse and inconsistent. 4 dca: disparity-preserved deep cross-platform association in this section, we employ multi-modal autoencoder to present our disparity-preserved deep cross-platform association model. 4.1 problem formulation we first introduce the problem of user-centric cross-platform association. given a set of aligned users u, for each user u belong to u, his or her representations on different platforms are known. the goal is to find the association among these representations , so that cross-platform applications can be carried out . 4.2 disparity-preserved deep cross-platform association multi-modal autoencoder is an extension to basic autoencoder. it is trained to reconstruct multiple inputs from a unified hidden layer when given multiple modalities of the same entity, thus is able to discover correlations across modalities. it has been widely applied to various multi-modal tasks since being proposed . hong et al. extend the concept of multimodal to multi-source . in this paper, we treat representations of the same user on different platforms as multiple modalities of his or her unified latent representation, and modify the structure of multi-modal autoencoder to conduct disparity-preserved cross-platform association. the detailed structure of multi-modal autoencoder is formulated as: h = g x i wi 1xi ! + b1 # , {modifier letter circumflex accent} xi = g x10 wi 2h + bi 2 x11 , where i belong to {t, y } denotes different platforms . xi is the multi-modal input layer, specifically the representations ui of the user u on different platforms. h is the hidden layer, i.e, the derived unified user latent representation. {modifier letter circumflex accent} xi is the output layer, i.e, the reconstructions of inputs. weight matrices w and bias units b serve as parameters of the multi-modal autoencoder, denoted as {greek small letter theta} together. g is the activation function. the loss function of multi-modal autoencoder is defined as follows: l = x i {modifier letter circumflex accent} xi -xi 2 2 + {greek small letter lamda} x wbelong to {greek small letter theta} {parallel to}w {parallel to}2 f + {micro sign} {parallel to}h {parallel to}1, where the first term is reconstruction error. the second term is regularizer to avoid overfitting. the third term is a sparsity constraint to encourage sparse latent representations. we minimize the loss function and train the parameters through backpropagation. multi-modal autoencoder takes representations of the same user on different platforms as inputs, mapping them to a unified hidden layer h and expecting accurate reconstructions. it learns mapping functions from representations on different platforms to the unified representation and then vice versa, which automatically completes the process of cross-platform association. moreover, it is able to handle the granularity difference through introduction of nonlinearity. we note that all multi-modal inputs should be given for the multi-modal autoencoder to work properly. however, in many cross-platform applications, we need to infer unknown data on other platforms, which is extremely difficult. one straightforward solution is to train several networks with a certain combination of several platforms as inputs and output the results for all platforms, setting every decoding weight figure 2: disparity-preserved deep cross-platform association model. ut and uy are representations of a same user on twitter and youtube respectively. in latent representations, ht and hy are platform-specific parts preserving the disparities, and hc is the common part associating different platforms. the estimated representations {modifier letter circumflex accent} ut and {modifier letter circumflex accent} uy are derived from both common and platformspecific parts. equally. however, such an approach does not scale well as we will need an exponential number of models. ngiam et al. propose to train bi-modal autoencoder using augmented but noisy data with additional examples that have only one single modality as inputs . in this paper, we augment data with average values of different platforms, and still expect the network to reconstruct real representations for all modalities. to make the model become more robust to absent inputs and being capable of inferring unknown data in crossplatform association task, we split the training data as follows: one-third of the training data includes user representations on twitter and average user representation on youtube, one-third consists of average user representation on twitter and user representations on youtube, the remaining one-third contains groundtruth representations. as aforementioned, platform-specific disparity may cause inconsistencies in cross-platform association. we need to envisage it and avoid messing up the association. to achieve this goal, we divide the hidden layer into three parts and cut off certain links, through which the shared and platformspecific parts are explicitly captured and preserved. specifically, the hidden layer is divided into h = , where ht and hy are twitter and youtube platform-specific parts and hc is the common part. as is shown in figure 2, we assume that twitter representations are derived from ht and hc without hy while youtube representations are derived from hy and hc without ht . the fully-connected structure is modified through cutting off links between units: from xt to hy , from xy to ht , from ht to {modifier letter circumflex accent} xy and from hy to {modifier letter circumflex accent} xt . the model is able to automatically map representations of the same user on different platforms to a unified representation while preserving the information in platform-specific parts at the same time. it does not require cross-platform data to be thoroughly consistent by allowing the existences of inconsistencies. thanks to the usage of shared common structure, cross-platform association becomes clearer and tighter. in addition, most traditional linear methods associate representations on different platforms by utilizing a linear transfer matrix, which is formulated in eq. and eq. . the linear combination limits the power in modeling complex relations across different semantic granularities. our modified multi-modal autoencoder naturally introduces nonlinear activation function g, possessing great advantages in handling the challenging granularity differences over linear methods. we choose sigmoid as the activation function in this paper and other activation functions such as relu or tanh can also be used. the time complexity is o) for training and o) for testing. m is the number of training iterations, n is the number of users for training, k is the hidden layer dimension, n1 and n2 are the input dimensions of two platforms. our proposed dca model, whose structure is presented in figure 2, automatically captures common information and preserves platform-specific disparities through its partially-connected structure, and meanwhile naturally adapts to granularity difference via nonlinear functions.",

to the smallest perplexity on a 5% held-out youtube video subset, in our experiments. to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed dca model, we implement the following baselines: linear regression-based association lr treats cross-platform association as a linear transfer problem, and pursues an explicit transfer matrix based on regression. the objective function is: min w wut -uy 2

paper, multi-modal autoencoder with l1-norm but without disparity-preserved structure and the dca model are examined. we perform evaluations in two scenarios: infer youtube from twitter. given users with their twitter representation ut , to estimate their youtube representation uy . infer twitter from youtube in turn. as is discussed before, by setting the unknown input to zeros, we can get the corresponding output as the predicted representation {modifier letter circumflex accent} u. in both scenarios, we utilize mean absolute error and root mean square error as evaluation metric: maei = 1

the examined models in two testing scenarios. the results show that both disparity preserving and nonlinearity contribute to better cross-platform association performance. for model parameters, in lr model as eq. 3, {greek small letter lamda} is selected by line search. in la model as eq. 4, {greek small letter lamda} and the number of latent attributes m are selected by two-dimensional grid

get an optimal setting for {greek small letter lamda}, {micro sign} and m. we then carefully fine-tune by a combined line-search strategy. specifically for all randomly initialized autoencoder model, we conduct 6 experiments and take the average result. performances are shown in figure 4 . several observations can be made: la and mlp achieve better result than lr, indicating that the shared latent structure and nonlinear mapping function both benefit the association. ma outperforms la and mlp through combining the two strategies. compared with ma, dca further improves the performance, demonstrating the contribution of the disparitypreserved structure. we also notice that compared with nonlinear models , the optimal parameters of the linear models vary greatly between two scenarios. we think it is the granularity differences that cause the parameter gaps. non-linear mappings can naturally tackle this issue, and have more advantages over linear ones. in total, the proposed dca model outperforms la by reducing relatively 9.3% on maey , 8.6% on rmsey , 7.2% on maet and 7.3% on rmset , and outperforms mlp by reducing relatively 7.5% on maey , 7.8% on rmsey , 6.5% on maet and 6.6% on rmset . it greatly improves the performance by preserving the disparities and introducing nonlinearity, validating that envisaging the inconsistency caused by platform-specific disparity and granularity difference jointly contributes to better cross-platform association performance. 6.4 evaluation of cross-platform video recommendation then we evaluate the proposed dca-based cross-platform video recommendation method for new youtube users, following the above infer youtube from twitter scenario. for each test user u, we randomly select as many as groundtruth interacted
