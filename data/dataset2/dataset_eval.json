this novelty detection is done by inspecting synaptic inputs to matching nodes . when a novel transition vector is introduced, a new output node is added to the matching and value networks , and the connection between matching and value networks is established . the strength of the connection wk is determined by the reward given to the rl agent after the transition from s to s {prime}. when the earlier input is introduced again, the maximally activated matching node is identified, and the connection between the identified matching node and the value node, which is exclusive and one-to-one , is updated by adding the reward obtained to the previous strength . it should be noted that only one matching node is allowed to be active and used to assess the value of the transition. in brief, the matching network memorizes transition vectors observed during training, and the value network stores the amount of rewards induced by the observed transitions. in the inference mode, in which qs agents choose the best action, qs agents utilize both the trained rl agents and env networks to make action plans, whose lengths are variable. in doing so, qs agents identify the most valuable transition vectors {increment}sk by inspecting connections' strength between matching and value networks. in this study, we identified synaptic weights higher than {greek small letter theta}hub defined in eq. 4. {greek small letter theta}hub =< wk > + {greek small letter alpha} * {greek small letter sigma} , where < wk > and {greek small letter sigma} are mean and standard deviations of synaptic weights, and {greek small letter alpha} is the scale constant which determines the magnitude of {greek small letter theta}hub. the default value of {greek small letter alpha} is 0.1. due to the one-to-one connections between matching and value networks, the synaptic weights allow us to identify the most valuable transitions observed during the training period, which are referred to as hub states hereafter. after identifying the hub states, qs agents search for an action plan to reach one of the hub states. in doing so, qs agents utilize the env network and the trained rl agent to predict future states to make an action plan. at each state, rl agent provides a possible action, and env network returns the next state in response to the suggested action. employing them recursively , qs agents can predict the future states. during this planning, at each time step, qs agents examine whether a transition vector is one of the hub states or not. if qs agents do expect to reach one of the hub states, they stop planning and execute the current plan. the maximum length of the action plan is 10 time-step, unless stated otherwise. if no hub state cannot be reached within the predefined maximal time-step, qs agents start over and make a new plan. for each state, qs agents are allowed to make a total of 5 different plans. if they cannot find a path to the hub states in all five plans, they inspect the values of the first transition in the five plans and choose the best immediate action according to the reward estimated by the value network. in this case, rather than taking a sequence of actions, qs agents execute a single action only. 4.2 qs agents' performance compared to rl agents to evaluate qs agents' performance, we compared their performance to that of rl agents by using the lunar-lander benchmark task included in the openai gym environment . in this study, we constructed rl agents , qs agents and env network using pytorch, an open-source machine learning library ; their schematics are illustrated in fig. 1. we trained rl, qs agents and env network during 5000 episodes; see section 3 for training details. figures 2a and b show the total amount of rewards given to the rl agent and the error function of the env network during 5000 episodes. as shown in the figure, while the reward in each trial fluctuates from one trial to another, the amount of rewards, on average, increases rapidly until 1000 episodes. after 1000 episodes, the speed of improvement is reduced. similarly, the error of env network is reduced most rapidly in the first 1000 episodes, and then the speed of error-reduction slows down. 4 a preprint - january 25, 2019 at every 1000 episode, we froze the learning and tested both qs and rl agents using the same 100 environments of lunar lander; that is, the environments are instantiated with the same random seeds. the rl agent in this study uses stochastic policy to choose actions , and thus its behaviors depend on the random seed forwarded to the pytorch. moreover, qs agents' behaviors are also stochastic, as they rely on rl agents for their decisions. to avoid potential biases based on their stochastic behaviors, we constructed 10 independent qs and rl agents by forwarding distinct random seeds to pytorch and calculated the average reward for both agents. figures 3a and b show the average amount of qs and rl agents for all 100 instantiations of environment. x-axis represents the identity of environment, and yaxis represents the reward averaged over 10 independently constructed agents. rewards are estimated after training the rl agent in 1000 episodes and 5000 episodes . as shown in the figure, the performance of qs agents with 10 time-step action plan are comparable to that of rl agents . figure 3c shows the average reward calculated using 10 independent agents in 100 environments, after training the rl agent in 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 episodes, respectively; that is, the mean values and standard errors are estimated from 1000 individual experiments . then, we varied the parameters to examine how they affect qs agents' performance. first, we tested the effects of action plans' lengths. as shown in fig. 4a, qs agents' performance improves, as the maximal length of action plans increases. second, we increased the number of hub states by lowering {greek small letter theta}hub. specifically, we set {greek small letter alpha} = 0.05 and estimated the amount of rewards. as shown in fig. 4b, qs agents' performance improved. we also increased {greek small letter theta}hub to further examine the effects of the number of hub states on qs agents' performance and found that qs performance is negatively correlated with {greek small letter theta}hub . finally, we perturbed the threshold value {greek small letter theta} for the novelty detection to see how it affects qs agents' performance. as shown in fig. 5b, qs agents obtained less rewards. this may be explained by the fact that the accuracy of predictions on qs agents' future states decreases, as the threshold {greek small letter theta} becomes lower,",

    "Text": "in this study, we propose qs agents to develop transparent rl agents. the newly proposed qs agents have two operating units, matching and value networks. with these two units, qs agents evaluate actions suggested by rl agents and choose the most probable choice. to select the most probable action, qs agents search for a path to reach one of the hub states by utilizing the env network which models the environment. our results suggest that this future plan ensures qs agents' good performance. then, do qs agents have transparent decision processes? qs agents' decisions are transparent for two reasons. first, the two operating units of qs agents have simple structures, which can be analyzed easily. the value network simply accumulates rewards given after the transition of states into synaptic weights, and it returns these stored values depending on inputs . that is, the value network is, in principle, equivalent to conventional memory units. the matching network identifies the old input , which is the closest to the current input by using the cosine similarity . in addition, as only a single matching node is allowed to be active, it is clear that the matching network's operation can be easily analyzed. second, qs agents rely on a simple set of rules to select the best actions based on suggestions made by rl. with both simple inner mechanisms and operating rules, qs agents have transparent decision-making process. moreover, it should be noted that the output nodes of the matching network are working independently from each other. that is, the matching nodes can be removed and added without interfering with other matching nodes' operations. this property makes manual modification of qs agents' actions possible. if a new piece of evidence finds a particular statetransition to be unacceptable, it can be removed. on the other hand, if some state-transitions {increment}s, which have not been previously observed, are considered valuable, they can be added to qs agents. similarly, the synaptic weights of value networks and hub states can also be changed, if necessary. therefore, qs agents can be continuously and incrementally improved to avoid mistakes.",

        "Text": "to address the possibility of deriving a comprehensible secondary agent from rl agents, we sought generic algorithms to be applied to general rl problems, but qs agents and their operations can be customized in domain-specific ways. below, we list a few potential variations of our generic qs agents. first, current qs agents evaluate individual transitions {increment}s using the rewards rl agents obtain immediately after completing the transition. however, the actual values of transitions can be estimated differently. for instance, instead of using the immediately obtained reward, we can use the total rewards from the transition to the end of an episode for evaluating state transitions. 5 a preprint - january 25, 2019 second, in this study, qs agents treat all state variables equally and rely on a single-state vector {increment}s. however, state variables do not have equivalent values in agents' behaviors. for example, the coordinates and velocities included in the state vectors of lunar-lander do have different importance in terms of agents dynamics. if we deal with coordinates and velocities distinctively, qs agents may evaluate the state-transitions more effectively. in this case, there will be two state vectors; s {rightwards arrow}s {dot above} x, sx. similarly, a single state-transition vector can be split into multiple ones; s {rightwards arrow}s1, s2, , sn. in doing so, qs agents need to utilize multiple matching and value networks, and the actual value can be estimated with a linear summation of outputs of multiple value nodes. third, the state transition vectors {increment}s can be coupled with state vectors s to estimate the values of actions more precisely. for instance, an agent's horizontal move can be either bad or good depending on the current state. if both state and transition vectors are used, qs agent may have better estimation of agents' actions. 5.2 implications for the brain' complementary system prefrontal cortex has been thought to be a hub for high-level cognitive functions such as decision-making, learning and working memory . however, pfc does not work alone and is known to be connected to other brain areas. the two main areas that have strong interactions with pfc are hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex . notably, complementary learning system theory suggests central roles of the interplay between pfc and hippocampus in our ability to learn continuously . then, why does pfc need to interact with acc which has been postulated to be associated with multiple functions such as error likelihood and prediction of expected outcomes ? we note that qs agents can predict the future outcomes, consistent with one of acc's hypothetical functions. based on our results that qs agents can evaluate rl agents' decisions, we propose that one of acc functions is to evaluate possible actions suggested by pfc and choose the best one depending on context.",

strong feller: for any f belong to bb and t > 0, qn+1,n t f is bounded continuous on kn. the dirichlet form is regular on l2. hence, by , the dirichlet form of y n+1,n is regular on l2. it also holds

belong to kn for any n belong to n, t > 0, and f belong to bb. in particular, xn is strong feller: pn t f is continuous on kn. proof. the dirichlet forms of xn and y n+1,n conincide. indeed, ckn and c {prime} kn coincide as the subspace of l2, and the norms {parallel to} {middle dot} {parallel to}h1 and {parallel to} {middle dot} {parallel to}h1 are equivalent on ckn. since the dirichlet forms coincide, it holds that pn t f = qn+1,n t f, m-a.e. for any t > 0 and f belong to cb. it follows from that for any {greek small letter epsilon} > 0 and x belong to kn, pn t+ {greek small letter

f = qn+1,n t f for any x belong to kn. a monotone class argument completes the proof. {white square} remark 3.2. the proof of lemma 3.1 is much simpler than that of , where the author uses the theory of extension domains. if x is a feller process, we can apply to x and obtain the strong feller property of xn. it follows from lemma 3.1 and that each pn t is a bounded operator from l1 to l {infinity}. in particular, each pn t becomes a compact operator on l2. therefore, the generator ln of {pn t }t>0 has no essential spectrum. 6 kouhei matsuura lemma 3.3. for each n belong to n, the eigenfunctions of -ln has a bounded continuous version on kn. the principal eigenfunction can be taken to be positive on kn. proof. we denote by { {greek small letter lamda}k} {infinity} k=1 {subset

be positive on kn. {white square} the heat kernel of xn is positive and continuous. lemma 3.4. for any n belong to n, there exists a continuous function pn t : * kn * kn {rightwards arrow} such that pn t f = z kn pn t f dm for any t > 0, x belong to kn, and f belong to bb. proof. recall that { {greek small letter lamda}k} {infinity} k=1 {subset of} and { {greek phi symbol}k} {infinity} n=1 are the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of -ln, respectively. by lemma 3.3, we may assume { {greek phi symbol}k} {infinity} n=1 are bounded continuous on kn. by , the series pn t := {infinity} x k=1 e- {greek small letter lamda}kt {greek phi symbol}k {greek phi symbol}k absolutely converges uniformly on , we prove the positivity of pn t . by lemma 3.3, it holds that {greek phi symbol}1 > 0 for any x belong to kn. therefore, it holds that pn t = {infinity} x k=1 e- {greek small letter lamda}kt {greek phi symbol}k2 > 0 for any t > 0 and x belong to kn. let x, y belong to kn and assume that ps > 0 for some s > 0. then, for any t, s > 0 with t > s, we have pn t = z kn pn s pn t-s dm. thus, pn t > 0 by the continuity of pn t and . this implies that there exists t*belong to such that pn t = 0 for any t belong to > 0 for any t belong to . we shall show that t*is finite. since kn is arcwise connected, transition densities of reflecting brownian motions on lipschitz domains 7 there exists a continuous function {greek small letter gamma} : {rightwards arrow}kn such that {greek small letter gamma} = x and {greek small letter gamma} = y. by the continuity of pn t and , for any s belong to , there exists an open neighborhood os {subset of}kn of {greek small letter gamma} such that for any z, w belong to os pn 1 > 0 since {greek small letter gamma} is a compact subset of kn, there exists n

that pn n {prime} = z kn {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} z kn pn 1pn 1 {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} pn 1 dm {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} dm > 0, which implies t* {less-than

compact subsets of h. thus, pn z is extended to a holomorphic function on h. if t*> 0, pn t = 0 for any t belong to = 0 for any z belong to h. this contradicts to the fact that t*< {infinity}. hence, we have t*= 0. {white square} in what follows, pn t is extended to a function on d*d by setting pn t = 0 outside kn * kn. lemma 3.5. it holds that limn {rightwards arrow} {infinity}px = 0 uniformly in over each compact subset of that lim m {rightwards arrow} {infinity}px = 0 for any x belong to k. since the convergence is monotone and non-increasing, we complete the proof by dini's theorem. {white

    "Text": "in our modern era, the amount of the required health care services is rapidly increasing. these high expectancies are going to overtake a proportional increase in health system infrastructures and professional personnel . telemedicine, which can be defined as the implementation of telecommunication technologies to provide medical services, has been introduced as a promising solution for the increasing shortages of the traditional medicine. telemedicine allows the measurement of biological and vital signals regardless of the borders and distances. in the telemedicine paradigm, the biological signals are obtained through variety of the biological sensing technologies, from the simple pulse oxiometer and temperature sensors to more sophisticated electrophysiological and electrocardiology devices . the gathered signals must be post-processed, and eventually transmitted to the associated health care provider. the exterior communication hardwares are placed in order to form the pathway from the on-body devices to at a distant hospital or physicians station. one of the advanced applications of the telemedicine is the drug delivery which can be controlled via end-to-end communication links. the drug delivery is an engineered method to deliver drugs to their targeted locations while minimizing the undesired side effects. one of the most important drug delivery applications is gene therapy. the utilization of the drug delivery in the gene therapy allows to convey of the desired genetic information to the patient's organism . the main challenge in the gene therapy is minimizing the risk of in vivo toxicity and prolonging the lifespan of the payload. also, the gene expression is short-lived due to the degradation of the plasmid in the nucleus . draft june 18, 2019 submitted paper 3 consequently, the high reliable with minimum error probability e2e-telemedicine communication links are crucial in gene therapy. the e2e communication scenario plays a central and fundamental role in designing the telemedicine system between the health care provider and the human body. the applicability of the telemedicine crucially depends on the reliability of e2e communication links . therefore, several quality of service metrics are defined as the measurement of the performance criteria for e2e communication, in which several reliable communication links must work together in various circumstances and media including inner, in-to-on, on, and off body areas. inspired by nature, one of the best solutions for inner body communication is to use chemical signals for carrying the information inside the human body to nanomachines through nanonetworks , . this communication paradigm, which is called molecular communication , has several advantages in comparison to electromagnetic based and acoustic wave based communication. the advantages includes but not limited to low energy consumption, the biocompatible characteristics, and the existence of the biological receptors to serve as antenna . similar to electromagnetic communication , different aspects of the communication have been studied in mc, such as channel modeling , noise and interference , and modulation and coding . recently, diffusion-based molecular communication has been received a significant attention among various mc propagation scenarios such as walk-way or flow-based . in dmc, without any additional and external energy, the molecules carrying the information propagate via brownian motion in all available directions in a fluidic medium , . however, the major challenge of dmc is its high limited range of the communication . the intermediate nanomachines, which are serving as relays, are deployed to overcome this issue. the performance of relay-assisted dmc is investigated in . in-to-on body wireless communication is the ec between nanomachines inside the body and the wearable device on the surface of the body skin . the main propagation environments of electromagnetic waves are inside and around the human body. on-body wireless communication is the interconnection and networking between wearable devices and the gateway june 18, 2019 draft 4 ieee transactions on communications transceivers . and ultimately, off-body wireless communication carries information from gateway transceivers to health care providers. the evaluation of the performance of the special scenario involving both the in-body to on-body and on-body to off-body electromagnetic wireless propagation links, including bit error rate , energy consumption, and data rate are considered in . in this study, we assume that inner nanomachines send information to a distant health care provider via dmc, inner-body, in2on-body, on-body, and off-body links as e2e-telemedicine communication. the time is divided into multiple slots with equal durations. at each time slot, a message is transmitted from inner nanomachine to the distant health care provider. in addition, the time slots are divided into several symbol durations for conveying the information in each link. the inner nanomachine sends its massage to the relay then the relay sends the received massage to the receiver nanomachine and ultimately through this sequence the massage is received by the health care system. due to the fact that no buffer is considered in the nanomachines, ec and dmc communications should be in serial1. therefore, ber and the delay of ec and dmc communication affects the e2e-ber and the total delay. it implies that the combination of ec and dmc must be considered as an integrated communication link. in addition, some telemedicine services are imposing the limited delivery time of the command from the health care provider to the end nanomachine. it results in a compromise between the performance of ec and dmc. the main question we aim to answer is: how to choose the physical layer parameters, such as the symbol durations, in order to minimize the e2e ber? for answering this question, we firstly derive the analytical closed-form expression of e2e-ber when binary pulse shift keying modulation for ec and on-off keying modulation for dmc is employed. then, we formulate the optimization problem to determine the optimal symbol durations in ec and dmc and solve it by using the bisection algorithm. it is important to emphasis that the main contribution of this paper is that what happen if we combine the ec and dmc as an integrated e2e-telemedicine communication and illustrate the trade off between the physical layer parameters such as symbol durations in ec and dmc which based 1 it means as soon as the packet arrives at an intermediate node, it is relayed over the next link towards the destination. draft june 18, 2019 submitted paper 5 on the best of authors' knowledge has not been addressed, yet. we also study the effect of the system parameters including the drift velocity and the detection threshold of dmc receiver on the performance of the e2e system. the rest of paper is organized as follows: in section ii, the system model is described. in section iii, the channel model of each communication is formulated, and the optimization problem is formulated and solved in section iv. the numerical results are presented in section v, and finally, the paper is concluded in section vi.",

molecules absorbed by node r in the source transmission time interval, i.e, ts,mol, and {greek small letter tau}r is the detection threshold at node r. after decoding, node r re-encodes xr and forwards it to node d in the relay transmission time interval, i.e, ts,mol. draft june 18, 2019 submitted paper 11 the information bit detected by node d is denoted by xd. ga t,r follows the normal

and {greek small letter sigma}2 0t,r and {greek small letter sigma}2 1t,r are variance values which are derived as follows 3 : {micro sign}0t,r =0.5qaqa t,r + {micro sign}n, {micro sign}1t,r =0.5qaqa

the value of pr can be calculated as pr x12 xr = 1 x13 = pr x12 xt = 1 x13 pr x12 xr = 1 x0c x0c x0c x0c xt = 1 x13 + pr x12 xt = 0 x13 pr x12 xr = 1 x0c x0c x0c x0c xt = 0 x13 . by using the map

to model the statistical ber of the in2on-body channel. the snr of the link between the nanomachine and the wearable device can be expressed as {greek small letter gamma}in2on = {greek theta symbol}ts,in2onpin2on n0 10-b 10, {greek theta symbol} = exp pl + 10nlog10 din2on d0 10 ln 10 ! , where pl is the path loss in db at a reference distance d0, pin2on is the transmission power of the nanomachine, ts,in2on is the symbol duration of in2on body channel, n is the path loss exponent, din2on is the distance between nanomachine and the wearable device, n0 is the power spectral density of the zero mean complex additive white gaussian noise, and b {tilde operator}n is a normally distributed random variable that models shadowing effect , . it is clear that, the above parameters corresponding to in2on body communication depend on location of nanomachines inside the blood vessel in deep tissue or near-surface of skin which details of the model derivation can be found in and are summarized in table iv draft june 18, 2019 submitted paper 13 by considering binary phase-shift keying modulation, the ber of the instantaneous snr is given by p e in2on = 1 2erfc, where erfc is the complementary error function. the average ber is derived by averaging p e in2on over {greek small letter gamma} which is given by {macron} p e in2on = {infinity} z 0 p e in2onf {greek small letter gamma}d {greek small letter gamma}. considering the fact that the snr is log-normally distributed, the aber in does not have the analytical closed-form solution . therefore, the complementary error function is approximated as follows : erfc = 2 x12 0.168e-1.752x2 + 0.144e-1.05x2 + 0.002e-1.206x2x13 . therefore, the aber for the log-normal model, using the approximation in , is expressed as {macron} p e in2on = 0.168 {greek capital letter phi} x12 1.752e {micro sign} {greek small letter gamma}+ {greek small letter sigma}2 {greek small letter gamma} 2 , {greek small letter sigma} {greek

model and ber the path loss of the link between the wearable device and the gateway is a function of the distance, the part of the body that the wearable device is located, and the motion of the human body . the best fitting distribution for these scenarios has been found to be the log-normal distribution . the closed-form of ber for the case that snr is log-normally distributed june 18, 2019 draft 14 ieee transactions on communications with mean {micro sign}, and scale parameter {greek small letter sigma}, can be obtained in similar to . for the case that snr is log-normally distributed with mean {micro sign}, and scale parameter {greek small letter sigma}, the ber can be solved in the closed-form similar to . however, in this scenario, we have {micro sign} {greek small letter gamma} = {micro sign} + ln, {greek small letter sigma} {greek small letter gamma} = {greek small letter sigma}on and {greek small letter gamma}on = /n0, where pw and ts,on are the transmit power of the wearable device, and the symbol duration time of on-body channel, respectively. d. off-body communication channel model and ber rayleigh fading channel with additive white gaussian noise is assumed for off-body communication link. thus, average ber of bpsk is given by {macron} p e off = 1 2 x14 1 {macron} {greek small letter gamma}off 1 + {macron} {greek small letter gamma}off x15 , where {macron} {greek small letter gamma}off = /n0 is snr per bit. pg, ts,off, doff, and {greek small letter alpha} are transmit power of the gate-way device, symbol duration of off-body channel, the distance between the gate-way and the access point and the path loss exponent, respectively. e. e2e communication channel model and ber in order to compute the e2e-ber, we use the fact that bers of the above-mentioned communication links are independent, due to their independent physical mediums. therefore, the total bit error probability of e2e system can be written as p e e2e = x qbelong to y p e q y kbelong to y,k {combining long solidus overlay}=q p c k + x qbelong to y p c q y kbelong to y,k {combining long solidus overlay}=q p e k, where p e e2e is the total bit error probability and p e q and p c q are the bit error probability and bit correct probability of link y belong to {mol, in2on, on, off}, respectively. in addition, p c q = 1 -p e q .",

    "Text": "as mentioned in section ii, the total time duration of each time slot denoted by ts, is divided into two time durations: one for dmc denoted by ts,dmc, and the other one for ec denoted by ts,ec. the time duration of each slot for e2e communication is predetermined and set to ts which implies the following equation holds: ts = ts,dmc + ts,ec, draft june 18, 2019 submitted paper 15 where ts,ec indicates symbol duration of the entire wireless communications including on-body, in2on-body, and off-body communication. the important question is that how ts is chosen? in fact, some telemedicine services are imposing the limited delivery time of the command from the health care provider to the end nanomachine. for example the gene therapy drug delivery allows us to transfer the desired genetic information to the patient's organism . in this e2etelemedicine case, it is important to convey the genetic information with minimum risk and at a specified time due to performing the desired chemical reactions . consequently, the value of ts is imposed by telemedicine services regarding the type of drug delivery process. consequently, the value of ts is imposed by telemedicine services regarding the type of drug delivery process. by fixing ts, this predefined delay time is divided into ec and dmc which leads to a compromise between the performance of the ec and dmc. once again, we emphasize that ts is fix and predetermined via telemedicine services , . for example, in case of utilizing dmc in drug delivery, the time of releasing the drugs into the intended location is controlled by the drug releasing mechanism . our target is finding the symbol duration ratio in a way that holds. next, we formulate an optimization algorithm for finding the optimum time slot partitioning to achieve the best performance in e2e communication. the objective is to minimize the e2e ber of the system. therefore, the problem is formulated as min ts,dmc pe e2e s.t ts = ts,dmc + ts,ec. we also assume ts,ec is divided into three intervals of equal duration associated to in2on-body, on-body and off-body communication links. one should note that the objective function in is not a convex function, and hence, the optimization problem is not convex. however, it could be shown that the objective function is quasiconvex , due to the fact that its domain and all its sublevel sets are convex , . one method to solve the quasiconvex optimization problem relies on the representation of the sublevel sets of a quasiconvex function via a family of convex inequalities, as described in . for solving the optimization problem , we utilized the bisection method, in which, the optimal symbol duration is computed by solving a convex feasibility problem at each step. according to , the h-sublevel set of a function f : june 18, 2019 draft 16 ieee transactions on communications table ii: proposed algorithm based on the bisection method initialization: set lower-bound= 0, upper-bound= 1 and 0 < {latin small letter o with ogonek} < 1 iterations: step 1: h= /2. step 2: solve the convex feasibility problem . step 3: if is feasible, upper-bound= h; else lower-bound= h. step 4: if |upper-bound - lower-bound| {less-than or equal to} {latin small letter o with ogonek}, then stop. otherwise, go back to step 1. rn {rightwards arrow}r is defined as {greek small letter psi}h = {x belong to dom f | f {less-than or equal to}h}, where r is the set of real numbers. consequently, the new optimization problem whose constraint is the h-sublevel set of the objective function in problem can be written as find ts,dmc s.t pe e2e -h < 0, ts = ts,dmc + ts,ec. the proposed algorithm based on the bisection method for solving our problem is presented in table ii where {latin small letter o with ogonek} is a positive small number. the bisection optimization solution is a function of the dmc parameters and snr of ec where snr of the ec is estimated at the beginning of the transmission as a transmission routine procedure, and dmc parameters are pre-determined and fixed. therefore, the bisection algorithm is run in the ec transmission side which does not have computational complexities. on the other hand, from the computational point of view, this method is a simple and robust root-finding mathematical algorithm which is of low complexity as investigated in . draft june 18, 2019 submitted paper 17 table iii: simulation setting. variable values variable values wx, wy, wz {micro sign}m/s d 4 * 10-9 m2/s {micro sign}n 40 {greek small letter sigma}2 n 100 ts,dmc ms qa, qb zx, zy, zz {micro sign}m dr, dd 100 {micro sign}m din2on 20 mm don 1.3 m ts,total 9 ms ploss 63.24 dbm {micro sign} -0.39 {greek small letter sigma}on 0.23 table iv: in2on body communication link parameters. variable deep tissue near surface pl 47.14 49.81 n 4.26 4.22 {greek small letter sigma}in2on 7.85 6.81",

performance of the error probability in dmc is analyzed in fig. 4. in this figure, the ber of dmc as a function of threshold at the receiver for different values of relay location is shown. it shows that by changing the location of node r, the ber is also changed. the location of the destination node in y axis is 100 {micro sign}m. by setting the relay location in y axis as 50 {micro sign}m where

the trade-off between dmc and ec is achieved. the regions of dmc dominance and trade-off between ec and dmc are shown in fig. 7. the performance of the proposed optimization problem for different

this case, the symbol duration is increased. it is due the fact that in such scheme, increasing the velocity in x axis can divert the molecules from their direction to nodes r and d, to another

matter particles . features of dm interactions can be determined from the direct and indirect detection experiments apart from their direct searches in the present and proposed colliders . the direct detection experiments like dama/ libra , cogent , cresst , cdms , xenon100 , lux and pandax-ii are designed to measure the recoil momentum of scattered atom or nucleon by dm in the chemically inert medium of the detector, while the indirect detection experiments such as fermilat , hess , ams-02 etc. are looking for the evidences of the dm pair annihilation to standard model particles such as photons, e+e-, {micro sign}+ {micro sign}-, {greek small letter tau} + {greek small letter tau} -, {macron} bb pairs and etc. in last few years, many experiments like pamela have reported the excess in the positron flux without any significant excess in {macron} p channel . the peaks in e+ e-channel are also observed in atic and ppb-bets balloon experiments at around 1 tev and 500 gev respectively. recently, dark matter particle explorer experiment has also observed a sharp peak around {tilde operator}1.4 tev favoring the lepto-philic dm annihilation cross-section of the order of 10-26cm3/s. the excess in e+ e-can be either due to astrophysical events like high energy emission from the pulsars or resulting from dm pair annihilation in our galactic neighborhood preferably to e+ e-channel. since the aforementioned experiments have not observed any significant excess in anti-proton channel, the dm candidates, if any, appears to be lepton friendly lepto-philic and have suppressed interaction with quarks at the tree level. various uv complete new physics extensions of sm have been proposed essentially to solve the gauge hierarxiv:1901.00192v2 21 jul 2019 2 archy problem in the top-down approach which include theories like extra-dimensions , super-symmetry , little-higgs , extended 2-hdm models with singlets as portal of dm intearctions and etc. these models naturally provide the dm candidates or wimps, whose mass-scales are close to that of the electro-weak physics. however, the direct detection experiments have shrunk the parameter space of the simplified and popular models where the wimps are made to interact with the visible world via neutral scalars and/ or gauge bosons. the model independent dm-sm particles interactions have also been studied in the bottom-up e {latin small ligature ff}ective lagrangian approach where the mediator of dmsm interactions are believed to be much heavier than the mass-scale of the lighter degrees of

invariant higher dimensional e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators constructed with the light degrees of freedom. the constrained parameters space from various experimental data then essentially maps and direct towards the viable uv complete theoretical models. the generic e {latin small ligature ff}ective lagrangian for scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, axial-vector interactions of sm particles with the scalar, vector, spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 dark matter candidates have been studied in literature . sensitivity analysis for dm-quark e {latin small ligature ff}ective interactions at lhc have been performed in a model-independent way for the dominant mono-jet + / et, mono-b jet + / et and mono-t jet + / et processes. similarly, analysis for dm-gauge boson e {latin small ligature ff}ective

operators in the context of super-symmetric models where the majorana dm particle neutralino being lsp was assumed to be much lighter than that of the squark masses. this was followed by series of papers where the authors have calculated the one loop e {latin small ligature ff}ect of dm-nucleon scattering induced by the twist-2 quarks and gluonic operators for the fermion, vector and scalar dm respectively. the hadronic matrix elements induced by twist-2 operators can however be identified with the second moment of parton distribution functions and thus can be constrained from the available pdfs. this in turn constrain the coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients of such higher dimensional e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators to estimate the dm-nucleon scattering cross-sections for a suggested dm and squark mass range. in this paper, we undertake the analysis for spin 1/2, 0 and 1 dm interactions induced by lepto-philic and uy gauge boson b-philic e {latin small ligature ff}ective twist-2 higher dimensional gauge invariant operators. this article is organized as follows: we formulate the e {latin small ligature ff}ective interaction lagrangian for fermionic, scalar and vector dm with sm leptons and neutral electro-weak gauge bosons via twist-2 operators in section 2. in section 3, we constrain the coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients of the e {latin small ligature ff}ective lagrangian from predicted relic density and perform a consistency check w.r.t. indirect and direct detection experiments. the constraints from the lep on the coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients of the effective lepto-philic and uy gauge boson b-philic operators and the sensitivity analysis of these coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients at the proposed ilc are discussed in section 4. finally we summarize in section 5. 2 e {latin small ligature ff}ective interactions of lepto-philic & uy gauge boson b-philic dm we initiate the construction of the e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators by writing the contact interaction between any sm leptons {greek small letter psi} and fermionic dm {greek small letter chi} with masses m {greek small letter psi} and m {greek small letter chi} respectively, assuming that the mediator mass scale, if any, should be of the order of the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}of the e {latin small ligature ff}ective theory , which in general is much heavier than the masses of the sm and dm fields. these contact interactions for example can be motivated from the super-symmetric models where spin-independent neutralino-lepton interactions are facilitated by the exchange of heavy sleptons and/ or higgses, assuming majorana neutralino to be the lsp. for an illustration of such contact interactions, we write twist-2 type-1 and type-2 lagrangians with the coupling strengths {greek small letter alpha}1 and {greek small letter alpha}2 respectively as: l1 = 1 m {greek small letter chi} {greek small letter alpha}1 {greek

appearing in the eq. is the scalar operator. the constraints on the four fermionic scalar dm operators has been extensively studied in the literature . however, the contributions of the tensor operators in equations and respectively are higher than those of the scalar operators due to the momentum dependence and therefore the coupling constants {greek small letter alpha}1 and {greek small letter alpha}2 would be comparatively more severely constrained for a given choice cut-o {latin small ligature ff}. therefore it is worthwhile to probe the e {latin small ligature ff}ect of these tensor operators in the dm pair annihilation and dm-electron or dm-nucleon scatterings. the twist-2 interactions of fermionic dm can also be realized through the twist-2 operators constructed out of sm charged and neutral electro-weak vector gauge bosons ov ew {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {identical to}v ew {greek small letter rho} {micro sign}v ew {greek small letter nu} {greek small

further the formalism can be extended to include the twist-2 type-2 interactions of spin 0 and spin 1 dm particles with sm charged leptons and electro-weak gauge bosons using equation . we analyse all such operators emerging from twist-2 interactions with sm charged leptons and neutral electroweak gauge bosons in this study. there are other lepto-philic dm tensor operators which can have significant e {latin small ligature ff}ect on dm phenomenology like dipole moments etc. as shown in references . since we are interested in operators which contribute to the spin independent non-relativistic dm nucleon scattering process, we drop all the operators which are suppressed by the velocity of dm and/or nucleon. on using the equations of motions we expand all the interaction terms in the lagrangian in powers of the super-weak coupling constant {greek small letter alpha}ti. the spinindependent leading interactions in super-weak coupling expansion of the fermionic, vector and scalar dm operators are retained for analysis as explicitly shown in references for the case of fermionic, vector and scalar dm operators interacting with quarks and gluons. we enlist a minimal set of relevant twist-2 leptophilic and uy gauge boson b-philic operators inducing contact interactions with dirac fermion {greek small letter chi}, real scalar {greek small letter phi}0 and real vector v 0 {micro sign} dm candidates in the following lagrangian: ldm e {latin small ligature ff}. int. = lspin 1/2 dm e {latin small ligature ff}. int. + lspin 0 dm e {latin small ligature ff}. int.

the nature of dm pair annihilation and hence its contribution to the relic density . annihilation due to all operators given in equations except fermionic type 2 are found to be contributing to both s-wave and p-wave partial amplitudes, while type 2 induced dm operator contributes to only p-wave amplitudes and hence comparatively suppressed. it is to be noted that the partial wave analysis of the annihilation processes induced by fermionic dm operators given in and remain same for both the majorana type and/ or dirac type because of the contact e {latin small ligature ff}ective interactions. we are now equipped to analyse and constrain these e {latin small ligature ff}ective interactions from the dm phenomenology. 4 .005 .01 .02 .05 .1 .2 .3 .5 .7 17x101 102 2x102 5x102 103 2x103 5x103

    "Text": "3.1 constraints from relic density in this sub-section we discuss the relic abundance of lepto-philic and uy gauge boson-philic dm and constrain the e {latin small ligature ff}ective interactions from the predicted dm relic density {ohm sign}dmh2 of 0.1138 +/- .0045 and 0.1199 +/0.0022 by wmap and planck collaborations respectively. the current relic density for dark matter is calculated from the dm number density ndm by solving the boltzmann equation d dt ndm + 3 h ndm = - {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter sigma}ann |v| {mathematical right angle

exp x1a-mdm t x1b#1/2 where g is the degrees of freedom. to numerically compute the current dm relic density we need to calculate the thermally averaged dm annihilation cross sections. since the freeze-out for thermal relics occurs when the massive particle is non-relativistic i.e. |v| << c, we make an expansion in |v| /c and then {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter sigma}

have computed the thermal-averaged annihilation cross-section in the appendix for the dirac fermion, a real scalar and real vector dm candidates. they are worked out in appendix a. for {greek small letter tau} +/--philic case, all dm - leptons couplings except that of dm {greek small letter tau} +/- identically vanish. to compute relic density numerically, we have used maddm and madgraph . we have generated the input model file required by madgraph using feynrules , which calculates all the required couplings and feynman rules by using the full lagrangian given in equation . we scan over the dm mass range 10 - 1000 gev whose relic density satisfy {ohm sign}dmh2 {less-than or equal to}0.1199 for all vanishing interactions except one non-zero coupling {greek small letter alpha}ti fixed at unity. we study and plot the relic density contours in the plane defined by dm mass and the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}corresponding to four lepto-philic, {greek small letter tau} +/--philic and b-philic operators in figures 1a, 1b and 1c respectively. we observe a bump around mdm {asymptotically equal to}45-90 gev in figure 1c due to opening up of z {greek small letter gamma} and z z annihilation channels induced by b philic dm operators. the increase in the total annihilation cross-section decreases the number density of the dm and as a result for a fixed dm relic density and coupling constant the contour shows a bump in the mdm- {greek capital letter lamda} plane. all points lying on the solid lines in figure ?? satisfy {ohm sign}dmh2 {less-than or equal to}0.1199 . these points are also the allowed upper limit on the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}for a given dm mass and thus the shaded region enclosed by the corresponding solid line is the cosmologically allowed parameter region of the respective operator. the lower value of the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}corresponding to the same dm mass will lead to only partial contribution to relic density and therefore may survive in model where more than one type of dm particles are allowed and/ or switching more than one type of e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators simultaneously. we observe that the sensitivity of the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}for fermionic type-1 operator increases with the varying dm mass. among the type-2 operators, scalar dm cut-o {latin small ligature ff}is found to be the most sensitive. it is important to mention that the relic density contours for a electro-philic dm will be almost same to that of the {greek small letter tau} +/--philic case. 3.2 indirect detection since the dm annihilation rate is proportional to the square of dm density, therefore dm annihilation is likely to be propelled in the over-dense region of the universe such as galactic center, dwarf spheroids and sun generate high flux of energetic light sm particles like charged hadrons, jets, the charged leptons e.g. electron, positron and photon. since the non-relativistic dm particles are colliding at rest with each other, the energy of gammarays and the produced charged lepton is of the order of {tilde operator}mdm. indirect experiments which in general are either ground-based or satellite borne particle detectors are sensitive to these characteristic fluxes of light sm particles. for example fermilat is a space borne experiment designed to measure the tracks of electron-positron pairs which are produced when gamma-rays interact with the detector material , while hess is the ground based cherenkov telescope geared to detect the gamma ray spectrum . in this section we calculate the thermally averaged annihilation cross sections for fermionic, real scalar and real vector boson dm candidates to pair of charged leptons and photons. the analytical expressions for these cross-sections corresponding to the lepto-philic and uy gauge boson b-philic operators are given in equations - and - respectively. we have used 220 km/s as the average velocity of the dm. the thermal averaged dm annihilation cross-section is computed numerically for a given set of parameter which satisfy the relic density constraint from the planck data as depicted in figure ??. for the lepto-philic and {greek small letter tau} +/--philic operators we compute the dominant thermal averaged annihilation crosssection to {greek small letter tau} + {greek small letter tau} -pair using equations , , and corresponding to the fermionic dm type-1 and type-2, scalar dm type-2 and vector dm type-2 induced operators. the variation of the annihilation cross-section with the dm mass are depicted in figures 2a and 2b respectively. the solid lines in figures 2a and 2b are essentially the lower bound on the allowed annihilation cross-section satisfying the relic 6 .005 .01 .02

thus restrict the respective allowed shaded region from above. figure 2a shows the contours for the fermionic, scalar and vector dm interacting via type-1 or 2 twist operators assuming the universal lepton flavor couplings with the dm. density constraints for a given dm mass. it is interesting to note that although the analytical expression for the scalar and vector dm annihilation cross-section are not same but still we observe a complete overlap of the scalar and vector dm solid lines for {greek small letter alpha}v 0 t2 = {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}0 t2 which is an artifact of the two distinct values of the respective e {latin small ligature ff}ective cut-o {latin small ligature ff}that satisfy the same relic density for a given dm mass. these results are compared with the upper bound on the allowed annihilation cross-section in {greek small letter tau} + {greek small letter tau} -channel obtained from the fermilat data . thus the null experimental results for the given mass range translate into the lower limits on the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}for the respective operators. the dm annihilation cross-section to the pair of electrons induced by the electro-philic dm are identical to those depicted in figure 2b for the respective operators. for uy gauge boson b-philic dm, we look for the photon pair production channel and the thermally averaged dm annihilation cross section is computed using equations , , and corresponding to the fermionic dm type-1 and 2, scalar dm and vector dm type-2 induced operators respectively. figure 2c show the annihilation cross-sections depict in solid line for each case satisfying the relic density and thereby giving the lower bound on the cosmologically allowed annihilation cross-section. as in the case of lepto-philic and {greek small letter tau} +/--philic, we observe that the scalar and vector annihilation cross-section overlaps for the reason mentioned earlier. we compare our results with 7

and above, which gives the upper lower bounds on the respective b-philic operators. 3.3 dm-electron scattering direct detection experiments look for the scattering of nucleon or atom by dm particles. these experiments are designed to measure the recoil momentum of the nucleons or atoms of the detector material. these scattering can be broadly classified as dm-electron scattering, dm-atom scattering, and dm-nucleus scattering. since the lepto-philic, {greek small letter tau} +/-philic and b-philic dm do not have direct interactions with quarks or gluons at tree level, therefore we explore tree level dm-electron elastic scattering induced by the lepto-philic operators only. in this article, we restrict our study for those directdetection processes which are realised at the tree level interactions of the lepto-philic dm operators with the free and bound electrons. consider the elastic scattering of nonrelativistic dm having four-momentum k with free electron having four momentum p to a final state dm and scattered electron having four momentum k {prime} and p {prime} respectively. in order to understand the realistic dmelectron scattering, we initiate our computation by giving the following leading contributions to the spin averaged matrix elements squared corresponding to the scattering processes induced by fermionic, scalar and vector lepto-philic operators: |m

the dm - free electron elastic scattering cross-section with varying dm mass depicted in solid lines for fermionic type-1 and 2, scalar type2 & vector type-2 twist-2 lepto-philic operators. the cross-section is computed for the coupling fixed at the unity and the corresponding cut-o {latin small ligature ff}which satisfy the relic density {ohm sign}dmh2 = 0.119 for a given dm mass. 8 although the analytical expressions of the scattering cross-sections corresponding to the type i and type ii twist interactions of the fermionic dm are similar but we observe the two distinct solid lines corresponding to these contributions in figure 3 because of the di {latin small ligature ff}erent values of the respective cut-o {latin small ligature ff}s contributing to the same relic density for a given dm mass when {greek small letter alpha}t1 = {greek small letter alpha}t2. same reason holds for the observed distinguishable contributions from scalar and vector dm scattering cross-sections respectively in figure 3 for {greek small letter alpha}v 0 t2 = {greek small letter alpha} {greek small letter phi}0 t2 although the corresponding analytical expressions are same. these results are then compared with the null results of dama/libra at 90% confidence level for dm-electron scattering and xenon100 at 90% confidence level for inelastic dm-atom scattering. it is important to note that electro-philic dm -free electron scattering cross-sections corresponding to the respective operators computed using the upper bound on the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}obtained for a given dm mass from relic density constraints as shown in figure 1b and unity coupling strength, will be slightly higher than those shown in the figure 3. the dm - free electron scattering corresponding to the {greek small letter tau} +/--philic and b-philic operators occurs at the one loop level and therefore are further suppressed. on the same note, due to the absence of the tree level dm quark interactions, dm-nucleon scattering induced by the lepto-philic and uy -philic twist-2 operators are either one or two loop suppressed, however it dominates over the dm-free electron scattering. 3.3.1 inelastic scattering : e {latin small ligature ff}ect of bound electrons the non-relativistic dm essentially collides the bound electron of fixed energy ee = me -enl b and momentum distribution p and then finally ejects the electron from the atom with the energy er + me -enl b , where er is the recoil energy of the scattered electron. the inelastic dm - electron differential scattering cross-section w.r.t. the recoil energy in the lab frame is computed to be d {greek small letter sigma}nlm der = |mnlm|2 32 {greek small letter pi} edm ee vrel |k + p| = | {greek small

z d3v vrel f {circled dot operator} x nlm d {greek small letter sigma}nlm der where {greek small letter rho}0 , nt , f {circled dot operator} and vrel are local density of dm , number of target particles per unit mass, velocity distribution of dm in lab frame and relative velocity of dm and bound electron respectively. substituting and using nai as the detector material , we compute the event rate as dr der = {greek small letter rho}0 64 {greek small letter pi} m3 dm me x n,l {greek lunate epsilon symbol}nl {greek small letter eta} |mfree|2 where {greek small letter eta} {identical

iodine {tilde operator}1 kev, the suppression factor becomes {tilde operator}10-6. it is important to mention that the event rates from lepto and uy -philic induced dm-nucleon scattering which are suppressed by {tilde operator}2, where z is charge of the nucleus at one loop order, are however do not have any wave-function suppression. 4 collider sensitivity of e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators 4.1 lep constraints on the e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators we investigate the constraints on the lepto-philic and b-philic e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators from the existing results and observations from lep data. we compute the crosssection for the process e+e- {rightwards arrow} {greek small letter gamma} {star operator}+ dm pair, and compare with the combined

corresponding to each solid line are forbidden by lep observation. the regions below the colored dashed lines corresponding to respective four operators satisfy the relic density constraint {ohm sign}dmh2 {less-than or equal to}0.1199 +/- 0.0022. sured cross-section from the combined analysis for the said process is found to be .055 pb along with the measured statistical error {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter sigma}stat, systematic error {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter sigma}syst and total error {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter sigma}tot of .031 pb, .008 pb and .032 pb respectively . therefore, contribution due to an additional channel containing the final states dm pairs and resulting into the missing energy along with two quark jets can be constrained from the observed {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter sigma}tot. in figures 4a and 4b, we plot the 95% c.l. solid line contours satisfying the cross-section observed {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter sigma}tot .032 pb corresponding to the lepto-philic and b-philic operators in the two dimensional plane defined by the dm mass and the lower bound on the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}at the fixed value of respective coupling {greek small letter alpha}ti. the respective shaded regions in figure 4 are disallowed by the combined lep analysis. thus the phenomenologically interesting dm mass range {less-than or equivalent to}50 gev is completely disfavored by the lep experiments. 4.2 constraints from lhc observations some of the interesting signatures of dm are missing energy {combining long solidus overlay}et on transverse plane with jets, photons, z0 or any other visible sm particles. for lepto-philic and bphilic dm cases we consider pp {rightwards arrow} x00z0 {rightwards arrow}l+ l-x01 + {combining long solidus overlay}et and p p {rightwards arrow} {combining long solidus overlay}et {greek small letter gamma} processes at the lhc respectively . the recent analysis of p p {rightwards arrow}l+l-l+l-at {square root}s = 8 tev for both cms and atlas showed that the measured events are consistent with sm and an integrated luminosity of 20.7 fb-1. however, in reference the authors have shown that the contribution of lepto-philic dm dimension six operators can be strongly constrained at {square root}s = 14 tev for the dm mass {less-than or equal to}250 gev. we believe the enhancement in the centre of mass energy and luminosity will enable both the detectors to probe the sensitivity of the lepto-philic twist operators. recently the atlas collaboration has reported the events containing an energetic photon and large missing transverse momentum for bsm searches at {square root}s = 13 tev and an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb-1 which agrees with sm predictions within the systematic and statistical uncertainty. the sm background contribution arises from p p {rightwards arrow}z {greek small letter gamma}, p p {rightwards arrow}w {greek small letter gamma}, p p {rightwards arrow}z {greek small letter gamma} and p p {rightwards arrow} {greek small letter gamma} + jets processes. the events containing fake photons coming from electrons and jets are also included in the analysis. the experimental observations constrain the contribution of the e {latin small ligature ff}ective operators and put an upper bound on disallowed {greek capital letter lamda}eff for dm coupling fixed at unity and a given dm mass due to non-observation of any appreciable change in sm predicted events. 4.3 / et + mono-photon

analysis for the background and the signal processes corresponding to the accelerator parameters as conceived in the technical design report for ilc and given in table 1 is performed by simulating sm backgrounds and the dm signatures using madgraph and the model file generated by feynrules . we impose the basic selection cuts {combining long solidus overlay}et {greater-than or equal to} p m2 z + 5 {greek capital letter gamma}zmz and |mj1 j2| {less-than or equal to} p m2 z -5 {greek capital letter gamma}zmz to reduce the backgrounds for the process e+ e- {rightwards arrow} {combining long solidus overlay} e {greek small letter gamma}*. on the same note, we impose the following cuts to reduce the backgrounds for the dm pair production in association with mono-photon: - transverse momentum of photon pt {greek small letter gamma} {greater-than or equal to}10 gev, - pseudo-rapidity of photon is restricted as | {greek small letter eta} {greek small letter gamma}| {less-than or equal to}2.5, - dis-allowed recoil photon energy against on-shell z0 2 e {greek small letter gamma} {square root}s {combining long solidus overlay} {greek lunate epsilon symbol} , and for {square root}s = 250 gev, 500 gev and 1 tev respectively. as a first step towards preliminary analysis we study the significance s for the dm production processes, defined as s = ns q nb + 2 where ns is the number of dm with mono-photon events, nb is the number of sm background events and {greek small letter delta}sys is the systematic error. we compare the three sigma significance of the dm pair production with associated with on/ o {latin small ligature ff}-shell photons, for three representative values of dm mass 75, 225, and 325 gev respectively. we give the kinematic reach of {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}corresponding to all cases of scalar, fermionic and vector dm based on the 3 {greek small letter sigma} e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency in table 2 and find that mono photon signatures gives the better kinematic reach of {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}for a given coupling and mass of the dm. therefore, we restrict our analysis for the dm pair production with associated with mono-photons. the 3 {greek small letter sigma} sensitivity contours in {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}-mdm plane are drawn for the dm production cross-sections with {greek small letter alpha}ti = 1 and conservative {greek small letter delta}sys {tilde operator}1% in figures 5a, 5d, 5b, 5e, 5c and 5f. figures 5a and 5d correspond to lepto-philic and b-philic operators respectively for the proposed ilc at {square root}s = 250 gev at an integrated luminosity of 250 fb-1, figures 5b and 5e correspond to lepto-philic and b-philic operators respectively for the proposed ilc at {square root}s = 500 gev at an integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1, and figures 5c and 5f respectively depict the same for {square root}s = 1 tev at an integrated luminosity of 1 ab-1. the shaded region of parameter space associated with each contour can be explored by the proposed collider at s {greater-than or equal to}3. thus, we get the kinematic reach on the cut-o {latin small ligature ff} scale {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}at ilc for all relevant twist-2 lepto-philic and uy gauge boson b-philic induced dm operators. 14 4.4 di {latin small ligature ff}erential cross-sections and {greek small letter chi}2 analysis the photon transverse momentum and photon pseudo-rapidity are found to be most sensitive kinematic observables for the process e+e- {rightwards arrow}/ et + {greek small letter gamma}. to study the shape profile and its mass dependence we generate the normalized one dimensional distribution for the sm background processes and signals for the fermionic, real scalar and real vector dm candidates, keeping the respective e {latin small ligature ff}ective coupling constant to be unity and rest to zero. we plot the normalized di {latin small ligature ff}erential cross-sections for fixed cut-o {latin small ligature ff}scale {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature

fermionic dm operators in figures 6b and 6f respectively, respectively, type-2 scalar dm operators in figures 6c and 6g respectively, and type-2 vector dm operators in figures 6d and 6h respectively. each panel depict three shape profiles of the di {latin small ligature ff}erential distribution corresponding to three choices of dm masses 75, 225 and 325 gev respectively. shaded rosy-brown and dark khaki histograms depict the normalized di {latin small ligature ff}erential distributions w.r.t. pt {greek small letter gamma} in figures 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d and w.r.t. {greek small letter eta} {greek small letter gamma} in figures 6e, 6f, 6g, 6h respectively for the background processes. repeating the same exercise for the b-philic operators, we depict the shape profile of the normalised differential distributions w.r.t. pt {greek small letter gamma} and {greek small letter eta} {greek small letter gamma} corresponding to three choices of dm masses 75, 225 and 325 gev induced by type-1 fermionic, type-2 fermionic, scalar and vector dm w.r.t. pt {greek small letter gamma} in figures 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d and w.r.t. {greek small letter eta} {greek small letter gamma} in figures 7e, 7f, 7g, 7h respectively. the di {latin small ligature ff}erential distributions for the background sm processesses w.r.t. pt {greek small letter gamma} and {greek small letter eta} {greek small letter gamma} are depicted in all of these figures and are shown in shaded rosy-brown and dark khaki histograms respectively. we note that pmax t {greek small letter gamma} decreases with increase in dm mass. the shape of normalized distributions are comparatively more sensitive w.r.t. dm masses in case of the b-philic operators. this suggests that for the bphilic operators induced interactions, imposition of dm mass dependent dynamical cut can minimize the background and enhance the significance. however, to enhance the sensitivity of the {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}at a fixed coupling {greek small letter alpha}ti = 1 w.r.t. dm masses, we compute the {greek small letter chi}2 with the double di {latin small ligature ff}erential distributions of kinematic observables pt {greek small letter gamma} and {greek small letter eta} {greek small letter gamma} corresponding to the background and signal processes for 50 gev {less-than or equal to}mdm {less-than

integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1, and 100 gev {less-than or equal to}mdm {less-than or equal to}500 gev at {square root}s = 1 tev and an integrated luminosity of 1 ab-1. the {greek small letter chi}2 is defined as {greek small letter chi}2 {identical to} {greek small letter chi}2 = n1 x j=1 n2 x i=1 uf8ee uf8ef uf8ef uf8ef uf8ef uf8f0 {increment}n np ij i j s {increment}n sm+np ij i j + {greek small letter delta}2 sys x1a {increment}n sm+np ij i j x1b2 uf8f9 uf8fa uf8fa uf8fa uf8fa uf8fb 2 where {increment}n np ij and {increment}n sm+np ij are the number of di {latin small ligature ff}erential new physics and total events respectively in the two dimensional hx00 {increment}pt {greek small letter gamma} x01 i -j ith grid. here {greek small letter delta}sys represents the total systematic error in the measurement. we consider only one e {latin small ligature ff}ective operator at time with the fixed coupling constant of unity and adopted a conservative value for the systematic error to be 1%. we simulate the two-dimension di {latin small ligature ff}erential distributions using the collider parameters as given in table 1 and choosing the basic selection cuts. in addition we impose dm mass dependent dynamical cuts to minimize the background for uy gauge boson b-philic induced interactions, which translates into an acceptance dynamical cut on the photon energy e {greek small letter gamma} {less-than or equal to}s -4m2 dm 2 {square root}s . we plot the 3 {greek small letter sigma} contours at 99.73% c.l. in the mdm {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}for lepto-philic and b-philic operators in figures 8a and 8d respectively corresponding to {square root}s = 250 gev with an integrated luminosity of 250 fb-1, figures 8b and 8e correspond to 3 {greek small letter sigma} contours at 99.73% c.l. in the mdm - {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}for lepto-philic and b-philic operators for {square root}s = 500 gev with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1. we also give the 3 {greek small letter sigma} contours at 99.73% c.l. for an upgraded high luminosity ilc operating at {square root}s = 1 tev with an integrated luminosity of 1 ab-1 in figures 8c and 8f corresponding to interactions induced by lepto-philic and b-philic operators respectively. we observe that the kinematic reach of the {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff} is enhanced 5-6 times in comparison to that obtained from the naive significance analysis. the b-philic operators showed better response to the {greek small letter chi}2 analysis based on the double di {latin small ligature ff}erential distributions which was expected from their one dimensional distribution shown in figure 7.",

atom and/ or dm - electron scattering respectively due to suppressed loop-level interactions of dm with the quarks in the nucleon. characterization for such lepto-philic and electro-weak gauge boson b-philic dm particles are likely to be di {latin small ligature ffi}cult and challenging at the lhc and therefore it becomes imperative to probe the sensitivity of the associated dm pair production channels at the proposed lepton collider ilc. motivated by these observations and restrictions, we have explored the viable alternative stable non-baryonic spin 1/2, 0 and 1 dm particles {tilde operator}10 - 1000 gev, contributing to the relic density through their super-weak interactions with twist-2 leptonic and uy gauge boson currents in a model independent approach. in this article, we have considered the super-symmetric and extra-dimensional models inspired e {latin small ligature ff}ective second rank twist interactions of the leptons and gauge bosons with the spin 1/2, 0 and 1 dm candidates. we have listed a minimal set of the twist-2 operators corresponding to lepto-philic and uy gauge boson tensor currents in section 2 which couples to the tensor currents generated by the bi-linears of the dm fields. these dm operators contribute we have analytically calculated the thermalized annihilation cross-sections for the fermionic, scalar and vector dm induced by lepto-philic - and b-philic - operators respectively, which are in agreement numerically with that of maddm. the relic density contours satisfying the planck observations depict the upper bound on {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}for fixed coupling {greek small letter alpha}ti = 1 in the mdm - {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}as shown in figures 1a, 1b and 1c for the lepto-philic, {greek small letter tau} +/--philic and b-philic dm interactions respectively. using these upper bounds on {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}for a given mdm, we estimated the thermally averaged annihilation indirect detection cross-section for lepto-philic and {greek small letter tau} +/--philic or electro-philic in figures 2a and 2b respectively are compared with that obtained from fermi-lat , while thermally averaged annihilation indirect detection cross-section for b-philic dm shown in figure 2c is compared with the observations from h.e.s.s. data . we find that the present experimental limits in the respective searches not only favours the allowed parameter space from the relic density, but also constraints the dm model by providing the lower bound on the {greek capital letter lamda}e {latin small ligature ff}min for a given dm mass at fixed coupling {greek small letter alpha}ti. we have computed the elastic dm - free electron direct detection scattering cross-section analytically only for lepto-philic induced interactions and depicted in figure 3 as the {greek small letter tau} +/--philic and b-philic dm interactions do not have any tree level interactions either with the atom or the nucleon. although the contribution of the loops are suppressed but they need to bee investigated for the complete study of the twist-2 operators. on superimposing inelastic dm - atom scattering cross-section from dama . xenon100t we observe that the parameter space allowed by the relic density is shrunk and we get a conservative lower limit on the cut-o {latin small ligature ff}at fixed coupling {greek small letter alpha}ti = 1 for a given dm mass. we have analysed the bound state e {latin small ligature ff}ects of the electron and derived the analytical expressions for the event rate . next, we probed and compared the 3- {greek small letter sigma} e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency of dm production processes e+e- {rightwards arrow} {combining long solidus overlay} et + {greek small letter gamma} {star operator} {rightwards arrow} {combining long solidus overlay} et +l+land e+e- {rightwards arrow} {combining long solidus overlay}et + {greek small letter gamma} at ilc induced through twist2 interactions of lepto-philic and b-philic interactions for mdm {tilde operator}50 -

surjective. the results of this paper are inspired by the following two observations: 1. the induced map on cohomology {greek small letter alpha}*: h* {rightwards arrow}h* is injective. the orthogonal complement h2 new = h* {up tack} {subset of}h* is a hodge structure of weight 2 with hodge numbers , where n = h1,1 -4. such a hodge structure is said to be of k3 type. 2. let s {prime} be a smooth projective complex surface with invariant pg = 1. then morrison showed that there exists a k3 surface x {prime} together with an isomorphism {greek small letter iota} {prime} : h2tra {rightwards arrow}h2tra that preserves the hodge structure, the integral structure, and the intersection pairing. tra denotes the transcendental part of a hodge structure, that is, the orthogonal complement of the hodge classes.) these observations lead to the following questions. 1.2 question a. {em dash} let s be as before. does there exist a k3 surface x together with an isomorphism {greek small letter iota}: tra q {rightwards arrow}h2tra that preserves the hodge structure, or the integral structure, or the intersection pairing? 1 arxiv:1901.00193v1 1 jan 2019 we give an a {latin small ligature ffi}rmative answer to this question in theorem 3.12, showing that there exists an x and {greek small letter iota} that satisfy , , and . the strategy of the proof is the same as for morrison's result mentioned above. 1.3 question b. {em dash} the hodge conjecture predicts that if {greek small letter iota} satisfies , then it is algebraic. do there exist x and {greek small letter iota} satisfying as above, such that {greek small letter iota} is algebraic? in general we are not able to answer this question. however, an intesting class of examples of the surfaces that we consider is formed by so-called product-quotients: these are surfaces birational to a surface /g, where c and d are curves equipped with an action by a finite group g. in these cases we give an a {latin small ligature ffi}rmative answer to question b in theorem 4.8. the strategy boils down to finding appropriate prym varieties in the jacobians of c and d, and taking for x the associated kummer variety. 1.4 question c. {em dash} since we are not able to settle question b in general, we may aim for something weaker, sitting in between question a. and question b. we use the notion of motivated cycles introduced by andr {latin small letter e with acute} . do there exist x and {greek small letter iota} satisfying as above, such that {greek small letter iota} is motivated? once again, we are not able to give an answer to this question in general. however, we give su {latin small ligature ffi}cient conditions for a positive answer to this question. for example, we show that to decide question c one may replace s with any other surface in the same connected component of the moduli space of surfaces of general type . in particular, question c has a positive answer for every surface s that lies in the same connected component as a product-quotient surface. if question c has a positive answer for the surface s, then we also deduce that the tate and mumford-tate conjectures hold for models of s over finitely generated subfields of c . we summarise these results in the following theorem . 1.5 theorem. {em dash} let s be a smooth projective complex surface with invariants pg = q = 2, and assume that the albanese morphism {greek small letter alpha}: s {rightwards arrow}a is surjective. 1. then there exists a k3 surface x and an isomorphism of hodge structures {greek small letter iota}: )tra {rightwards arrow}h2tra. 2. if s is a product-quotient surface with group g, then there exist x and {greek small letter iota} as above, and an algebraic cycle on s * x that induces {greek small letter iota}. 2/25 3. if s is in the same connected component of the gieseker moduli space as a product-quotient surface, then {greek small letter iota} is motivated and the tate and mumford-tate conjectures hold for s. 1.6 structure of this text. {em dash} in the next section, on the classification of surfaces with pg = q = 2, we very briefly recall what is known for the surfaces under consideration. it is important to stress that the classification of these surfaces is not yet complete. hence we present the state of the art up to now. we shall pay particular attention to those surfaces which are product-quotients recalling definitions, important properties and its associated group theoretical data. furthermore, we recall what is known about their moduli space. in section 3 we discuss the existence of hodge-theoretical k3 partners for all the surfaces with pg = q = 2, following morrison's theory. in theorem 3.12 we prove point 1 of theorem 1.5. in section 4 we discuss the problem to find a geometric description where possible of the hodge-theoretical k3 partners, proving point 2 of theorem 1.5. indeed, for those surface which are product-quotients we are able to find an algebraic k3 partner. finally in the last section we see how the results obtained can be used to prove that the tate and mumford-tate conjectures hold for these surfaces. as already mentioned here we use the notion of motivated cycles introduced by andr {latin small letter e with acute}. corollary 5.18 proves the last point of theorem 1.5. 1.7 acknowledgements. {em dash} the authors are indebted with bert

with pg = q = 2 2.1 {em dash} the classification of smooth projective complex surfaces with invariants pg = q = 2 is not complete, although there has been much progress in recent years. we give an overview of the current state of the art. let s be a minimal surface of general type with pg = q = 2, so that {greek small letter chi} = 1 -q + pg = 1. recall the following classical general inequalities: {right-pointing double angle quotation mark} k2 s {less-than or equal to}9 {greek small letter chi} . 3/25 {right-pointing double angle quotation mark} k2 s {greater-than or equal to}2pg, if q > 0, . these yield 4 {less-than or equal to}k2 s {less-than or equal to}9 under our assumptions. except for the case k2 s = 9, examples of such surfaces have been constructred for every value of k2 s in this range. since we are dealing with irregular surfaces, i.e, with q > 0, a useful tool to study them is the albanese map. the albanese variety of s is the q-dimensional variety alb := h0 {logical or}/h1. by hodge theory, alb is an abelian variety. for a fixed base point x0 belong to s, we define the albanese morphism as {greek small letter alpha} = {greek small letter alpha}x0 : s {rightwards arrow}alb, x 7 {rightwards arrow} z x x0 . the dimension of {greek small letter alpha} = 2) is called the albanese dimension of s and it is denoted by albdim. if albdim = 2, we say that s has maximal albanese dimension. for surfaces with q = 2, we have two possibilities: 1. albdim = 1 and {greek small letter alpha} is a smooth curve of genus 2; or 2. albdim = 2 and {greek small letter alpha} is a generically finite cover of an abelian surface. the first case is completely understood: we have a classification theorem, see . the second case is still open. by the degree deg of the albanese map is a topological invariant. in table 1 we summarize the state of the art of the classification using k2 s and deg as main invariants. {numero sign} k2 s albdim deg # dim name mtc

and 2. rk -rk {greater-than or equal to} {script small l} + 2. proof . this is a slightly weaker form of theorem 1.14.4 of . {white square} the following corollary is part of an observation by morrison, see corollary 2.10 of . 3.7 corollary. {em dash} let m be an even lattice with signature for some integer 0 {less-than or equal to}n {less-than or equal to}8. then there exists a unique primitive embedding m , {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter lamda} into the k3 lattice introduced above. 3.8 {em dash} let l be a lattice with signature , and assume that 2 {less-than or equal to}s+ {less-than or equal to}3 and s- {less-than or equal to}19. define {ohm sign} = {x belong to p | = 0, > 0}. note that {ohm sign} is an analytic open subset of the quadric in p defined by the equation = 0. if m , {rightwards arrow}l is an embedding of two such lattices, then there is a natural holomorphic map {ohm sign} {rightwards arrow} {ohm sign}. observe that there is a natural bijection uf8f1 uf8f4 uf8f2 uf8f4 uf8f3 hodge structures of k3 type on l such that for every nonzero x belong to l2,0 one has = 0, > 0, and x {up tack}l1,1 uf8fc uf8f4 uf8fd uf8f4 uf8fe {rightwards arrow} {ohm sign}, obtained by mapping a hodge structure on l to the point l2,0 in {ohm sign}. 3.9 {em dash} we denote with ffull 2d,k,c the moduli space of degree 2d primitively polarised k3 surfaces with full level k-structure for an admissible subgroup k {subset of}so; see for details. 3.10 proposition. {em dash} let b be a connected algebraic variety over c, and let v/b be a polarised variation of z-hodge structures of weight 2 of k3 type. let b be a point of b and assume that vb is a lattice with signature that admits a primitive embedding vb , {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter lamda}. then there is an {latin small letter e with acute}tale open b {white bullet} {rightwards arrow}b such that b lies in the image of b {white bullet}, a k3 space f : x {rightwards arrow}b {white bullet}, and a morphism of variations of hodge structures v|b {white bullet} {rightwards arrow}r2f*z that is fibrewise a primitive embedding and a hodge isometry on the transcendental lattices. 8/25 proof . let {small tilde} b {rightwards arrow}b be a universal cover of b, and let {small tilde} b be a point of {small tilde} b lying above b. let l denote the lattice underlying the fibre of v {small tilde} b. fix a primitive embedding l , {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter lamda}. under the induced map {ohm sign} {rightwards arrow} {ohm sign} the hodge structure on v {small tilde} b maps to a point x belong to {ohm sign}. by the surjectivity of the period map for k3 surfaces there is exists a complex k3 surface x, with h2 {tilde operator} = {greek capital letter lamda}, such that the hodge structure on h2 corresponds to x. let d belong to z and k {subset of}so be such that x admits a primitive polarisation of degree 2d with full level k-structure. this means that belong to ffull 2d,k,c. since l has signature we get a primitive embedding l , {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter lamda}d. this yields a diagram {small tilde} b {ohm sign} {ohm sign} b k {ohm sign} the composite map {small tilde} b {rightwards arrow}k {ohm sign} factors via a finite cover bk of b. {small tilde} b {ohm sign} {ohm sign} b bk k {ohm sign} fin {latin small letter e with acute}t by a theorem of borel the map bk {rightwards arrow}k {ohm sign} is algebraic. by proposition 3.2.11 of , there is an open immersion ffull 2d,k,c {rightwards arrow}shk, {ohm sign}), where the latter is the shimura variety parameterising polarised hodge structures on {greek capital letter lamda}d {circled times}q with a level k-structure. we now have a diagram {small tilde} b {ohm sign} {ohm sign} b bk k {ohm sign} shk, {ohm sign}) b {white bullet} ffull 2d,k,c fin {latin small letter e with acute}t {white bullet} {white bullet} where the bottom right rectangle is cartesian. by our choice of d and k, we know that belong to ffull 2d,k,c and b belong to b are in the image of b {white bullet}under the respective maps. in particular b {white bullet}is non-empty. pulling back the universal family of k3 surfaces from ffull 2d,k,c to b {white bullet}we end up with a k3 space f : x {rightwards arrow}b {white bullet}and a morphism of variations of hodge structures v|b {white bullet} {rightwards arrow}r2f*z. by construction it is fibrewise a primitive embedding and a hodge isometry on the transcendental lattices. {white square} 3.11 lemma. {em dash} let s be a smooth projective complex surface with invariants pg = q = 2. let {greek small letter alpha}: s {rightwards arrow}a be the albanese morphism, and assume that {greek small letter alpha} is surjective. define h2 new = 9/25 /tors) {up tack} {subset of}h*/tors. then h2 new has rank 14 -k2 s. in particular tra has signature with n {less-than or equal to}12 -k2 s. proof . by our assumptions we have {greek small letter chi}s = pg -q + 1 = 1. noether's formula gives e + k2 s = 12 {middle dot} {greek small letter chi}s = 12. observe that e = p4 i=0ibi, where b0 = b4 = 1, and b1 = b3 = 2q = 4. therefore b2 = 12 -k2 s + 2 {middle dot} 4 -2 {middle dot} 1 = 20 -k2 s. finally, b2 is the sum of the ranks of h2 new and h2. the latter has rank 6, and we conclude that h2 new has rank 14 -k2 s. since tra is a transcendental hodge structure of k3 type, it must have signature , with n {less-than or equal to}rk -2. {white square} 3.12 theorem. {em dash} let s be a smooth projective complex surface with invariants pg = q = 2, and let {greek small letter alpha}: s {rightwards arrow}a and h2 new be as in the preceding lemma 3.11. then there exists a complex k3 surface x and a morphism {greek small letter iota}: tra q {rightwards arrow}h2tra that preserves the hodge structure, the integral structure, and the intersection pairing. in other words, we have a positive answer to question a of the introduction. proof . since 4 {less-than or equal to}k2 s {less-than or equal to}9, lemma 3.11 shows that the lattice tra has signature with n {less-than or equal to}8. note that tra is even by the wu formula: for every v belong to h2 we have {identical to}) ; and we have tra {subset of}c1 {up tack}since tra is by definition perpendicular to all hodge classes. the result follows from corollary 3.7 and proposition 3.10. {white square}",

    "Text": "let s be a smooth projective complex surface with invariants pg = q = 2, and assume that the albanese morphism {greek small letter alpha}: s {rightwards arrow}a is surjective. in this

since theorem 3.12 provides an a {latin small ligature ffi}rmative answer to question a, the hodge conjecture predicts a positive answer to question b as well. in theorem 4.8 we show that this is indeed the case for certain surfaces that are product-quotients . if the essence of the proof must be captured in one sentence, it would be the following: the algebraic correspondence inducing {greek small letter iota} is built from the kummer k3 surface associated with a suitable 2-dimensional isogeny factor of the product of the jacobians of the curves that are used in the construction of the product-quotient surface s. 4.1 outline of this section. {em dash} this section is the most technical part of this paper. it is organised as follows. first we recall some facts about chow motives of surfaces. proposition 4.4 describes a natural decomposition of h2, for product-quotient surfaces s of unmixed type. in theorem 4.8 we give the general proof for the existence of an algebraic correspondence inducing {greek small letter iota}. 10/25 this proof relies on a case-by-case computation, for which we refer to a magma-script of which we tabulate the output. the final part of this section illustrates this proof by discussing one of the cases in detail, as an example. 4.2 chow motives of surfaces. {em dash} for an introduction to the theory of chow motives we refer to the excellent paper of scholl. let mrat denote the category of chow motives over c. we recall that mrat is an additive, q-linear, pseudoabelian category . there exists a functor h: smprop /c {rightwards arrow}mrat from the category of smooth projective varieties over c to the category of chow motives. if x is a smooth projective variety, and g is a finite group that acts on x, then we define h = hg. this leads to a satisfactory theory of motives of quotient varieties, as is explained in . we denote with chi ) the i-th chow group of a smooth projective variety x . in general, it is not known whether the k {latin small letter u with diaeresis}nneth projectors {greek small letter pi}i are algebraic, so it does not make sense to speak of the summand hi {subset of}h for an arbitrary smooth projective variety x/c. however, a so-called chow-k {latin small letter u with diaeresis}nneth decomposition does exist for curves , for surfaces , and for abelian varieties . for algebraic surfaces there is in fact the following theorem, which strengthens the decomposition of the chow motive. statement and proof are copied from theorem 2.2 of . 4.3 theorem. {em dash} let s be a smooth projective surface over c. there exists a self-dual chow-k {latin small letter u with diaeresis}nneth decomposition { {greek small letter pi}i} of s, with the further property that there is a splitting {greek small letter pi}2 = {greek small letter pi}alg 2 + {greek small letter pi}tra 2 belong to ch2 in orthogonal idempotents, defining a splitting h2 = h2alg {circled plus}h2tra with chow groups chialg) = uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 ns if i = 1, 0 otherwise, and chitra) = uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 ch2 aj if i = 2, 0 otherwise. here ch2 aj denotes the kernel of the abel-jacobi map. proof . the chow-k {latin small letter u with diaeresis}nneth decomposition is given in proposition 7.2.1 of . the further splitting into an algebraic and transcendental component is proposition 7.2.3 of . {white square} 4.4 proposition. {em dash} let s be a product-quotient surface of unmixed type with curves c1 and c2, and with group g. then the second k {latin small letter u with diaeresis}nneth component of s is given by h2 {tilde operator} = u {circled plus}z {circled plus}e, where u := x00h2 {circled times}h0 x01 {circled plus} x00h0 {circled times}h2 x01 , z := x00h1 {circled times}h1 x01g , e := q {circled plus} {greek small letter eta}, and where {greek small letter eta} is the number of exceptional divisors introduced in the minimal desingularization of the quotient surface. 11/25 proof . let {greek small letter eta} denote the number of exceptional divisors introduced in the minimal desingularization of the quotient surface. recall that for the surfaces that we are interested in we gave the value of {greek small letter eta} in table 2. observe that h2 = h2/g) {circled plus}e. notice that if the action of g on c1 * c2 is free then e = 0. by the k {latin small letter u with diaeresis}nneth formula we obtain h2 = x00h2 {circled times}h0 x01 {circled plus} x00h0 {circled times}h2 x01 {circled plus} x00h1 {circled times}h1 x01 . by definition we have h2/g) = h2g; and since g acts trivially on h0 and h2, we get the result. {white square} 4.5 remark. {em dash} note that we can further decompose the chow motive z of proposition 4.4 as z {tilde operator} = z1 {circled plus}z2 where z1 := h1g {circled times}h1g, z2 := m w belong to {modifier letter circumflex accent} g- {greek small letter chi}1 x10 h1 {circled times}h1x11g , where {modifier letter circumflex accent} g is the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of g over q, {greek small letter chi}1 is the trivial representation, and denotes the w-isotypical component. 4.6 remark. {em dash} observe that if w is a finite-dimensional q-vector space, then we may view it as a chow motive, as follows: it is determined by the identity hommrat = hommrat {circled times}w, and it is non-canonically isomorphic to q {circled plus}dim. if g is a finite group, and w is equipped with a finite-dimensional representation of g, then we may view the representation g {rightwards arrow}aut as an action of g on the chow motive w. 4.7 {em dash} we now state the main theorem of this section, which gives a partial answer to question b of the introduction. the rest of this section is dedicated to its proof. we refer to {section sign}4.16 for an explicit computation that illustrates the general argument of this proof. 4.8 theorem. {em dash} let s be a minimal surface of general type with pg = q = 2, of maximal albanese dimension isogenous to a product of unmixed type. then there exists a k3 surface x and a correspondence in s * x that induces an isomorphism between h2tra and h2tra new. 4.9 {em dash} the proof is done in several steps, and will be completed in {section sign}4.15. following proposition 4.4 and remark 4.5 we decompose h2 = u {circled plus}z1 {circled plus}z2 {circled plus}e. first of all we see that for i = 1, 2 the quotients ci/g =: ei are elliptic curves. the product e1 * e2 is the albanese variety of s, and we have h2 = u {circled plus}z1. secondly, let {greek small letter eta} be the number of irreducible components of the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution of the quotient surface . this gives e = q {greek small letter eta}. for the purpose of this theorem we are interested in the remaining term z2. to find an algebraic k3 partner x for s, we will find an abelian surface a as isogeny factor of j * j, such that z2 = h2tra {circled plus}qk for some k belong to z {greater-than or equal to}0. we may then take the minimal resolution of singularities of the kummer 12/25 surface km = a/ {mathematical left angle bracket}-1 {mathematical right angle bracket}for the k3 surface x. to find the isogeny factor a, we proceed by decomposing the jacobians j of ci for i = 1, 2 as products of simple abelian varieties following . 4.10 {em dash} now let a be an abelian variety of dimension g with a faithful action of a finite group g. there is an induced homomorphism of q-algebras {greek small letter rho} : q {rightwards arrow}endq. any element {greek small letter alpha} belong to q defines an abelian subvariety a {greek small letter alpha} := im) {subset of}a where m is some positive integer such that m {greek small letter rho} belong to end. this definition does not depend on the chosen integer m. we will now describe the so-called isotypical decomposition of the abelian variety a with group action by g. begin with the decomposition of q as a product of simple q-algebras q1 * {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} * qr. the factors qi correspond canonically to the rational irreducible representations wi of the group g, because each one is generated by a unit element ei belong to qi which may be considered as a central idempotent of q. the corresponding decomposition of 1 belong to q, 1 = e1 + {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} + er induces an isogeny, via {greek small letter rho} above, ae1 * {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} * aer {rightwards arrow}a which is given by addition. note that the components aei are g-stable complex subtori of a with homg = 0 for i {combining long solidus overlay}= j. the decomposition is the isotypical decomposition mentioned above. 4.11 {em dash} the isotypical components aei can be decomposed further, using the decomposition of qi into a product of minimal left ideals. fix an i belong to {1, . . . , r}, and let wi be the irreducible rational representation of g corresponding to the idempotent ei. we will now recall some facts from representation theory; see {section sign}12.2 of for details. write di for the simple algebra endg, and observe that qi = matni is a matrix algebra of degree ni over the opposite algebra, for some ni belong to z {greater-than or equal to}1. recall that the schur index of wi is the degree mi of di over its centre. if {greek small letter chi}i is the character of one of the irreducible summands of wi {circled times}q c, then deg {greek small letter chi}i = mi {middle dot} ni. there is a set of primitive idempotents { {greek small letter pi}i,1, . . . , {greek small letter pi}i,ni} in matni = qi {subset of}q such that ei = {greek small letter pi}i,1 + {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} + {greek small letter pi}i,ni. the abelian subvarieties a {greek small letter pi}i,j are mutually isogenous for j = 1, . . . , ni. let bi 13/25 be any one of these isogenous factors; we call it a reduced factor of aei and ni the multiplicity of the reduced factor: bni i {rightwards arrow}aei is an isogeny. replacing the factors in for every i = 1, . . . , r, we get an isogeny called the group algebra decomposition of the g-abelian variety a bn1 1 * {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} * bnr r {rightwards arrow}a. note that, whereas is uniquely determined, is not. it depends on the choice of the {greek small letter pi}ij as well as the choice of the bi. however, the dimension and the isogeny class of the abelian varieties bi is independent of choices. 4.12 remark. {em dash} if di = q, then we get a g-equivariant isomorphism h1 {tilde operator} = h1 {circled times}wi of chow motives, where g acts trivially on h1. 4.13 {em dash} while the factors in are not necessarily easy to determine, we may compute their dimension in the case of a jacobian variety. let c be a compact riemann surface equipped with an action of a finite group g and consider the induced action of g on j. define v to be the representation of g on h1 {circled times}z q. we use the same notation as at the beginning of this section, so the quotient c/g has genus g0 and the cover {greek small letter pi}: c {rightwards arrow}c/g has r branch points {q1, . . . , qr} where each qi has corresponding monodromy gi. the tuple is called the generating vector for the action . we now copy equation 2.14 from , and explain the notation afterwards: the hurwitz character {greek small letter chi}v associated to v is {greek small letter chi}v = 2 {greek small letter chi}1 + 2 {greek small letter rho}1*+ r x i=1 x00 {greek small letter rho}1*- {greek small letter rho} {mathematical left angle bracket}gi {mathematical right angle bracket} x01 . here {greek small letter chi}1 is the trivial character on g, and {greek small letter rho}1*is the character of the regular representation. the character {greek small letter rho}h is the induced character on g of the trivial character of the subgroup h. with this definition of {greek small letter chi}v in place, we have the following equality dim bi = 1 2 dimq {greek small letter pi}i,jv = 1 2 {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter psi}i, {greek small letter chi}v {mathematical right angle bracket} where {greek small letter psi}i denotes the character of the q-irreducible representation of g corresponding to wi. see for details. 4.14 {em dash} we will now complete the proof of theorem 4.8. we may calculate the dimension of the bi's for each class of surfaces in the statement, either by hand or using the magma script as in . the result of this computation is given in table 4. it is a coincidence that in the table all the characters that appear are actually self-dual and defined over q. one can check that for each row in the table, there is only one character {greek small letter chi} that appears in column char such that the dual character {greek small letter chi} {logical or}appears in column char. 14/25 g char - {greek small letter chi}1 j/e1 char - {greek small letter chi}1 j/e2 v4 , e * l1 , e * l2 s3 l2 1 , e * l2 2 d4 l2 1 , , e * e {prime} * l2 2 a4 l3 1 l3 2 s3 l2 1 l2 2 q8 a a {prime} d4 l2 1 l2 2 c2 l1 l2 table 4: the group algebra decomposition of the jacobian varieties j. the columns char - {greek small letter chi}1 have to be read in the following way: each list represents a non-trivial isotypical factor of j corresponding to a simple rational representation w of g. here d is the dimension of a reduced factor, n is the multiplicity of the factor and k is the identifying number according to the magma character table of the group g of an irreducible character appearing in w {circled times}q c. let w be the irreducible rational representation of g that corresponds to {greek small letter chi}. we will complete the proof by a case distinction. first assume that g {combining long solidus overlay}= q8. in this case, one may check that the schur index of w is 1, and in fact d = endg = q. in other words, we are in the situtation of remark 4.12. let l1 be a reduced factor of j corresponding with {greek small letter chi}, and denote with l2 a reduced factor of j that corresponds to {greek small letter chi} {logical or}. thus we have h1) {tilde operator} = h1 {circled times}w, h1) {tilde operator} = h1 {circled times}w {logical or}, as motives with an action of g. consequently, we find x10 h1) {circled times}h1)x11g {tilde operator} = h1 {circled times}h1 {circled times}g {tilde operator} = h1 {circled times}h1. we conclude that z2 {tilde operator} = h1 {circled times}h1 {tilde operator} = h2tra {circled plus}q {circled plus}k for some k belong to z {greater-than or equal to}0, and thus l1 * l2 is the 2-dimensional isogeny factor a of j * j that we are looking for. 4.15 the case g = q8. {em dash} in the case where g = q8, we find that d = endg = h which has schur index 2. in this case we cannot use the methods employed so far to prove that the jacobian is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves as in all the other cases. nevertheless, in it is proven that in this case the curves c1 and c2, which are of genus g = 3, admit a bigger automorphism group. indeed, their automorphism group is isomorphic to {right normal factor semidirect product}c2, which readily contains q8. more precisely, in it is shown that the curves c of genus g = 3 and with automorphism q8 and {right normal factor semidirect product}c2 give rise to the same subvariety in the moduli space of curves which is the family of table 2 in . therefore, we can try to decompose the jacobian of c using this larger group. 15/25 performing the calculation relative to this larger group we have : {right normal factor semidirect product}c2 l2 1 l2 2. to conclude, notice that the nineth character of {right normal factor semidirect product}c2 is not self dual, but we have to restrict it to q8. recalling that q8 {white left-pointing triangle} {right normal factor semidirect product}c2, one sees that all the condition of problem 5.2 on page 65 of are fulfilled. hence the restriction of this character to q8 is the only two dimensional irreducible representation, which is self dual. we remark that the li must be cm elliptic curves, since h injects into m2q). now recall that h {circled times}h {tilde operator} = end {tilde operator} = m4. we conclude that h1 {circled times}h1 {tilde operator} = x00h1 {circled times}h1 x01 {circled times} as chow motives with an action of g. in particular we have x00h1 {circled times}h1 x01g {tilde operator} = h1 {circled times}h1. this concludes the proof of theorem 4.8. 4.16 the case k 2 = 8 and g = v4. {em dash} as an illustration of the proof of theorem 4.8 and in particular the computations performed by the magma script, we will now study one example in detail. this example will occupy us for the next few pages. let e1 and e2 be elliptic curves, marked with two points {pi,1, pi,2} {subset of}ei. as group we take g = v4. let { {greek small letter alpha}i, betai} be generators of {greek small letter pi}1 and let {greek small letter gamma}i,j be a loop in {greek small letter pi}1 around pi,j. then we define two g-covers fi : ci {rightwards arrow}ei, using the riemann existence theorem , by the following epimorphisms of groups: {greek small letter pi}1 {rightwards arrow}g {greek small letter alpha}1 7 {rightwards arrow} =: a1 beta1 7 {rightwards arrow} =: b1 {greek small letter gamma}1,j 7 {rightwards arrow} =: c1,j {greek small letter pi}1 {rightwards arrow}g {greek small letter alpha}2 7 {rightwards arrow} =: a2 beta2 7 {rightwards arrow} =: b2 {greek small letter gamma}2,j 7 {rightwards arrow} =: c2,j by construction {pi,1, pi,2} {subset of}ei is the branch locus, and above each pi,j, there are 2 ramification points with branching orders 2. therefore, by the riemann-hurwitz formula the ci are curves of genus 3. for a non trivial element g belong to g, let {greek small letter chi}g denote the nontrivial character of g, that annihilates g, let {greek small letter rho} {mathematical left angle bracket}g {mathematical right angle bracket}denote the character of g induced from the trivial character of the subgroup generated by g, let {greek small letter rho}1*be the regular character. we get q = q {greek small letter chi} * q {greek small letter chi} * q {greek small letter chi} * q {greek small letter chi}. we proceed by calculating the hurwitz character relative to the first quotient . starting from the ramification data of the curve c1, we get {greek small letter chi}1 = , {greek small letter rho}1*= {greek small letter rho} {mathematical left angle bracket}1,0 {mathematical right angle bracket}= , where the induced trivial representation is calculated using the formula of exercise 3.19.b in . therefore, the hurwitz character is {greek small letter chi}v = . now we use eq. 16/25 to compute that the dimensions of the reduced factors b {greek small letter chi} of j are respectively 1, 1, 0, 1 for {greek small letter chi} = {greek small letter chi}, {greek small letter chi}, {greek small letter chi}, {greek small letter chi}. analogously, we compute that the dimension of the reduced factors b {greek small letter chi} of j are respectively 1, 0, 1, 1 for {greek small letter chi} = {greek small letter chi}, {greek small letter chi}, {greek small letter chi}, {greek small letter chi}. these results relate to row 1 of table 4 in the following way: means that there is a 1-dimension reduced factor with multiplicity 1 corresponding to the second character in the magma character table of v4, this is the character {greek small letter chi}. this is exactly the isogeny factor b {greek small letter chi} of j. similarly corresponds to the isogeny factor b {greek small letter chi} of j. both j and j have an isogeny factor b {greek small letter chi}, which corresponds to in table 4, and thus to the elliptic curves l1 and l2. 4.17 {em dash} now we will explain how to construct geometrically the algebraic k3 partner x of s = /g, and a correspondence that induces the isomorphism h2 newtra {rightwards arrow}h2tra. the k3 partner x will turn out to be the minimal resolution of kummer surface associated with l1 * l2. observe that fi factors as in the diagram: ci ci/ {mathematical left angle bracket} {mathematical right angle bracket} ci/ {mathematical left angle bracket} {mathematical right angle bracket} ci/ {mathematical left angle bracket} {mathematical right angle bracket} ei {greek small letter phi}i, {greek small letter phi}i, {greek small letter phi}i, {greek small letter psi}i, {greek small letter psi}i, {greek small letter psi}i, using the riemann-hurwitz formula we compute the following genera for the quotient curves: g) = 2, g {mathematical right angle bracket}) = 1, g {mathematical right angle bracket}) = 2; g) = 1, g {mathematical right angle bracket}) = 2, g {mathematical right angle bracket}) = 2. pushing the preceding diagram through the jacobian functor, we obtain the diagram: j j {mathematical right angle bracket}) j {mathematical right angle bracket}) j {mathematical right angle bracket}) ei this leads to the following isogenies of abelian varieties: j {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator}e1 * p) j {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator}e2 j {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator}e1 j {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator}e2 * p) j {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator}e1 * p) j {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator}e2 * p), 17/25 where p denotes the prym-tyurin variety associated to the cover {greek small letter psi}: it is the kernel of the induced map j between the jacobians . observe that li is isogenous to p). finally by we have j {tilde operator}j {mathematical right angle bracket}* p) {tilde operator}e1 * p) * p) j {tilde operator}j {mathematical right angle bracket}* p) {tilde operator}e2 * p) * p). we now go back to the surface s = /v4. since {greek small letter eta} = 0, we get h2 {tilde operator} = h2 {circled plus}h1)) {circled times}h1)). let us go further and build an algebraic k3 partner of s. to do that we consider the abelian surface a = p) * p) and divide modulo the natural involution. in this way we get a singular kummer surface. according to the propostion above and shioda and inose the minimal resolution x of the singularities of km is a k3 surface whose transcendental part of h2 is isomorphic to the transcendental part of h2. now consider the following diagram: c1 * c2 j * j a x s km all the morphisms in this diagram induce correspondences and by composing these correspondences we obtain an isomorphism h2tra new {rightwards arrow}h2tra that induces an isomorphism of hodge structures h2 newtra {rightwards arrow}h2tra.",

    "Text": "let s be a smooth projective complex surface with invariants pg = q = 2, and assume that the albanese morphism {greek small letter alpha}: s {rightwards arrow}a is surjective. in this section we attempt to answer question c of the introduction: does there exist a k3 surface x together with an isomorphism {greek small letter iota}: tra q {rightwards arrow}h2tra that is motivated in the sense of yves andr {latin small letter e with acute}? 5.1 {em dash} in this section we prove the tate and mumford-tate conjectures for surfaces that fall into type {numero sign}= 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 of table 1. we will use the language of motives, and specifically motivated cycles as introduced by andr {latin small letter e with acute} . this section is organised as follows: first we introduce notation and recall the definition of the mumford-tate group and the {script small l}-adic monodromy groups. then we will recall three conjectures that 18/25 are connected in the following sense: if two of the conjectures hold, then so does the third. these conjectures are the hodge conjecture; its {script small l}-adic analogue known as the tate conjecture; and the mumford-tate conjecture. starting from {section sign}5.9 we recall the definition of motivated cycles in the sense of andr {latin small letter e with acute} , and we quote the main theorems that describe the resulting category of motives. once we we have all the machinery in place we turn our attention to the proof of the tate and mumford-tate conjectures for the surfaces mentioned above. 5.2 notation. {em dash} let k {subset of}c be a field, and let x be a smooth projective variety over k. we denote with hi the singular cohomology group hi sing, q). it is naturally endowed with a pure hodge structure of weight i. let {script small l}be a prime number, and let {macron} k {subset of}c be the algebraic closure of k belong to c. we denote with hi {script small l} the {script small l}-adic {latin small letter e with acute}tale cohomology group hi {latin small letter e with acute}t. it is naturally endowed with a galois representation gal {rightwards arrow}gl). artin's comparison theorem between {latin small letter e with acute}tale cohomology and singular cohomology gives an isomorphism of vector spaces hi {script small l} {tilde operator} = hi {script small l} {tilde operator} {rightwards arrow}hi {circled times}q {script small l} that is functorial in x. recall from {section sign}4.2 that we denote with ch* the chow ring of x with q-coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients. recall the cycle class map cl: chi {rightwards arrow}h2i for singular cohomology. there is also a cycle class map cl {script small l}: chi {rightwards arrow}h2i {script small l} for {latin small letter e with acute}tale cohomology. these are compatible with the comparison isomorphism hi {script small l} {tilde operator} = hi {circled times}q {script small l}; we get the following commutative diagram: chi h2i {script small l} chi h2i h2i {circled times}q {script small l} cl {script small l} {tilde operator} cl _ {circled times}1 5.3 mumford-tate groups. {em dash} let v be a q-hodge structure. there is a representation of s = resc/rgm on v {circled times}r: on complex points acts on v belong to v pq by v 7 {rightwards arrow}z-p {macron} z-qv. write h = hv for this representation s {rightwards arrow}glr. the mumford-tate group of v is the smallest algebraic subgroup g {subset of}gl over q such that gr contains the image of hv . we denote the mumford-tate group of v with gmt. alternatively, gmt may be defined using the tannakian formalism. it is the algebraic group over q associated with the tannakian subcategory of q-hs generated by v . if v is polarisable, then this subcategory generated by v is semisimple, and hence gmt is a reductive algebraic group. two more remarks are in place: first, observe that gmt is a connected algebraic group, since s is connected. second, note that the subspace v {intersection}v 0,0 c of hodge classes in v is exactly the space of invariants v gmt. 19/25 5.4 {script small l}-adic monodromy groups. {em dash} let k {subset of}c be a field of finite transcendence degree over q. let {script small l}be a prime number, let v be a finite-dimensional q {script small l}-vector space, and let {greek small letter rho}: gal {rightwards arrow}gl be a representation that is continuous for the {script small l}-adic topology on v . the {script small l}-adic monodromy group of v is the smallest algebraic subgroup g {subset of}gl over q {script small l}such that g contains the image of {greek small letter rho}. we denote the {script small l}-adic monodromy group of v with g {script small l}. in general, the algebraic group g {script small l} is not connected; the identity component is denoted g {white bullet} {script small l}. an element of v is called a tate class if it is invariant under an open subgroup of gal. in particular, the subspace of tate classes in v is exactly the space of invariants v g {white bullet} {script small l}. in general, the algebraic group g {white bullet} {script small l} is not reductive. 5.5 conjecture . {em dash} let x be a smooth projective variety over c. then the image of cl: chi {rightwards arrow}h2i is the subspace of hodge classes h2i {intersection}h2i0,0 c . 5.6 conjecture . {em dash} let x be a smooth projective variety over a number field k. then the image of cl {script small l}: chi {rightwards arrow}h2i {script small l} spans the space of tate classes h2i {script small l}g {white bullet} {script small l}. 5.7 conjecture . {em dash} let x be a smooth projective variety over a number field k. the comparison isomorphism hi {script small l} {rightwards arrow}hi {circled times}q {script small l}induces and isomorphism g {white bullet} {script small l}) {rightwards arrow}gmt) {circled times}q {script small l}. 5.8 remark. {em dash} to illustrate how these conjectures fit together, we make the following claims. 1. if the mumford-tate conjecture is true for x, then the hodge conjecture for x is equivalent to the tate conjecture for x. 2. if the tate conjecture is true for all smooth projective varieties x over k, then the {script small l}-adic monodromy groups are reductive. this follows from . 3. if the hodge and tate conjectures are true for all x, then the mumford-tate conjecture is true for all x. 5.9 motivated cycles. {em dash} let k be a subfield of c, and let x be a smooth projective variety over k. a class {greek small letter gamma} in h2i is called a motivated cycle of degree i if there exists an auxiliary smooth projective variety y over k such that {greek small letter gamma} is of the form {greek small letter pi}*, where {greek small letter pi}: x * y {rightwards arrow}x is the projection, {greek small letter alpha} and beta are algebraic cycle classes in h*, and {star operator}beta is the image of beta under the hodge star operation. every algebraic cycle is motivated, and under the lefschetz standard conjecture the converse holds as well. the set of motivated cycles naturally forms a graded q-algebra. the category of motives over k, denoted motk, consists of objects , where x is a smooth projective variety over k, p is an idempotent motivated cycle on x * x, and m is an integer. a morphism {rightwards arrow} is a motivated cycle {greek small letter gamma} of degree n -m on y * x such that q {greek small letter gamma}p = {greek small letter gamma}. we 20/25 denote with hmot the object , where {increment}is the class of the diagonal in x * x. the k {latin small letter u with diaeresis}nneth projectors {greek small letter pi}i are motivated cycles, and we denote with hi mot the object . observe that hmot = l i hi mot. this gives contravariant functors hmot and hi mot from the category of smooth projective varieties over k to motk. 5.10 theorem. {em dash} the category motk is tannakian over q, semisimple, graded, and polarised. every classical cohomology theory of smooth projective varieties over k factors via motk. proof . see th {latin small letter e with acute}or {latin small letter e with grave}me 0.4 of . {white square} 5.11 definition. {em dash} let k be a subfield of c. an abelian motive over k is an object of the tannakian subcategory of motk generated by objects of the form hmot where x is an abelian variety, or x = spec for some finite extension l/k, with l {subset of}c. we denote the category of abelian motives over k with abmotk. 5.12 example. {em dash} if x/k is a k3 surface, then h2 mot is an abelian motive, by th {latin small letter e with acute}or {latin small letter e with grave}me 7.1 of . the lefschetz motive q is abelian, because any class of a hyperplane section in an abelian variety a will give a splitting h2 mot {tilde operator} = m {circled plus}q. 5.13 theorem. {em dash} the hodge realisation functor h : abmotc {rightwards arrow}q-hs is a full functor. proof . see th {latin small letter e with acute}or {latin small letter e with grave}me 0.6.2 of . {white square} 5.14 theorem. {em dash} let b be a reduced connected scheme of finite type over c. let f : x {rightwards arrow}b be a smooth projective morphism, and {greek small letter xi} a global section of the sheaf r2if*q. if there is a point 0 belong to b such that {greek small letter xi}0 is motivated, then {greek small letter xi}b is motivated for all b belong to b. proof . see th {latin small letter e with acute}or {latin small letter e with grave}me 0.5 of . {white square} 5.15 {em dash} by theorem 5.10, the singular cohomology and {script small l}-adic cohomology functors factor via motk. this means that if m is a motive, then we can attach to it a hodge structure h and an {script small l}-adic galois representation h {script small l}. the comparison isomorphism between singular cohomology and {script small l}-adic cohomology extends to an isomorphism of vector spaces h {script small l} {tilde operator} = h {circled times}q {script small l}that is natural in the motive m. we shall write gmt for gmt). similarly, we write g {script small l} ) for g {script small l}) ). the mumford-tate conjecture extends to motives: for the motive m it asserts that the comparison isomorphism h {script small l} {tilde operator} = h {circled times}q {script small l}induces an isomorphism g {white bullet} {script small l} {tilde operator} = gmt {circled times}q {script small l}. 5.16 {em dash} we now have the notation and theory in place to answer question c about surfaces of general type with pg = q = 2. we give a partial answer to this question in the following results. 21/25 5.17 theorem. {em dash} let {greek small letter alpha}: s {rightwards arrow}b be a smooth projective family of surfaces of general type with invariants pg = q = 2 and dominant albanese morphism. assume that b is connected, and assume that there is one point 0 belong to b such that the motive h2 mot of the fibre s0 is an abelian motive. then for every point b belong to b, there exists a k3 surface xb, and an isomorphism of motives h2 mottra new {tilde operator} = h2 mottra. in particular, the motive h2 mot is abelian. proof . the main idea of the proof is as follows: using proposition 3.10 we construct a family x {rightwards arrow}b of hodge-theoretic k3 partners. we then use theorem 5.13 to prove that h2 mottra new is isomorphic to h2 mottra new. finally, this isomorphism spreads out to the other fibres via theorem 5.14. we now make this sketch precise. by replacing {greek small letter alpha}: s {rightwards arrow}b with the pullback along {small tilde} b {rightwards arrow}b, we may and do assume that b is simply connected. let v denote the subvariation of hodge structures of r2 {greek small letter alpha}*q whose fibre vb at a point b belong to b is h2new. fix a point b belong to b. by proposition 3.10 we find that there is an open b {white bullet} b {subset of}b such that b belong to b {white bullet} b , a k3 space f : x {rightwards arrow}b {white bullet} b , and a morphism of variations of hodge structures {greek small letter iota}: v|b {white bullet} b {rightwards arrow}r2f*q that is fibrewise a primitive embedding and a hodge isometry on the transcendental lattices. we may view {greek small letter iota} as a global section of the sheaf v {logical or}|b {white bullet} b {circled times}r2f*q which is a subsheaf of r4*q. note that we may and do assume that b belong to b {white bullet} 0; indeed, if b / belong to b {white bullet} 0, then we first prove the statement for all points in b {white bullet} 0, and then rerun the proof with a point 0 {prime} belong to b {white bullet} b {intersection}b {white bullet} 0. recall from example 5.12 that h2 mot is an abelian motive. also note that h2 mot is abelian by assumption. hence {greek small letter iota}0 is motivated, by theorem 5.13. by theorem 5.14, we see that {greek small letter iota}b is motivated as well. this means that we obtain an isomorphism h2 mottra new {rightwards arrow}h2 mottra. in particular, the motive h2 mottra new is abelian. to conclude that h2 mot is abelian, observe that h2 mot {tilde operator} = h2 mottra new {circled plus}h2 mottra old {circled plus}qr. the term h2 mottra old is abelian, because it is the part coming from the albanese surface, whose motive is abelian by definition. {white square} 5.18 corollary. {em dash} let k be a finitely generated subfield of c. let s be a surface of general type over k with invariants pg = q = 2 and dominant albanese morphism. assume that s lies in one of the connected components of the gieseker moduli space of surfaces of general type that contain a surface that is isogenous to a product of curves. then the tate and mumford-tate conjectures are true for s. proof . we first prove the mumford-tate conjecture for s. let a be the albanese variety of s. by theorem 5.17 there exists a k3 surface x such that h2 mottra new {tilde operator} = h2 mottra. possibly after replacing k by a finitely generated extension we may assume that x is defined over k. hence the motive hmot is an object in the tannakian subcategory of motk generated by hmot and hmot. therefore it su {latin small ligature ffi}ces to prove the mumford-tate conjecture for hmot {circled plus}hmot. this follows from the main result of . recall that the hodge conjecture is true for s, by the lefschetz- theorem. therefore the tate conjecture for s is true, since it follows from the conjunction of the hodge conjecture and the mumford-tate conjecture. indeed, if {greek small letter gamma} {subset of}h2 {script small l} is a tate class, then this means 22/25 that it is fixed by g {white bullet} {script small l}. we have just proven the mumford-tate conjecture for s, so we know that g {white bullet} {script small l} {tilde operator} = gmt {circled times}q {script small l}. this means that {greek small letter gamma} belong to h2 {script small l} {tilde operator} = h2 {circled times}q {script small l}is a q {script small l}linear combination of gmt-invariant classes in h2. those gmt-invariant classes are precisely hodge classes, and by the lefschetz- theorem we know that they are in the image of the cycle class map. we conclude that {greek small letter gamma} is in the q {script small l}-span of the image of the {script small l}-adic cycle class map. {white square}",

    "Text": "scalar-tensor theories have been among the most popular alternatives to general relativity , and also had a large impact on cosmology . these theories commonly posit that gravitation is governed by scalar degrees of freedom in addition to the usual metric of general relativity, but their phenomenology can be very diverse otherwise due to various di {latin small ligature ff}erent coupling terms in their actions. an important feature of stts is the freedom to choose the fundamental field variables while formulating them, e.g. one is always free to redefine a new metric {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} by scaling a given metric g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} by a function of the scalar {greek small letter phi}: {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = a2g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}. possibilities in such redefinitions are infinite, but two specific cases, called frames, have been of special importance. the first is the jordan frame where the fundamental metric field of the theory couples minimally to matter degrees of freedom, and the second is the einstein frame where the metric is such that the metric action is in the einstein-hilbert form, hence identical to that of gr . einstein and jordan frames have been investigated in great detail in the literature which has shown their equivalence in many cases , revealed that one frame can be more useful for analyzing specific problems such as approximation schemes , and even led to the discovery of previously overlooked stts . the aim of this work is generalizing the analysis of the relationship between these two frames to theories that contain higher spin fields such as vectors instead of scalars, or less common conformal scaling functions a such as those that depend on field derivatives. our main motivation is the recently investigated phenomenon of spontaneous tensorization which is a generalization of spontaneous scalarization in the scalar tensor theories introduced by damour and esposito-far` ese . in def theories, the scalar fields spontaneously grow to large values from arbitrarily small perturbations near neutron stars due to a tachyonic instability. such a theory, with some minor caveats, confirms to all known weak-field tests while providing large deviations from gr in the strong field, hence provides an especially good target to be tested using gravitational wave observations . the desirable controlled spontaneous growth in def theories is not a direct results of the scalar nature of the coupling, or the tachyonic nature of the instability. any field that carries an instability, such as a ghost on a vector field, in principle can lead to similar spontaneous growth which is called spontaneous tensorization . overall, the theory of def is but one member of a large family of theories with similar observational signatures, all of which can be potentially tested with gravitational waves in the near future . all spontaneous tensorization theories have been formulated in the einstein frame for reasons we will discuss, and he main theme of this study is their properties in the jordan frame. despite our motivation, we will not specify our coupling terms to those that incite spontaneous growth, hence our results are general. we will use the terminology of einstein and jordan frames in a generalized sense, the former is always the one where the gravitational action is in the einstein-hilbert form, and the latter is always the one where matter fields couple to the metric minimally. in sec. ii we present the tranformation between einstein and jordan frames in the quintessential stt of brans and dicke whose conformal matter coupling structure is kept in all other theories we are interested. in sec. iii we obtain the jordan frame for a vectortensor theory. in sec. iv we go back to scalar fields, but this time study derivative couplings. we demonstrate the existence of higher derivative terms in the jordan frame, commonly indicative of ill-posedness, and present the results from the existing literature which resolve this problem. we also discuss the invertibility of the frame transformations. in sec. v we analyze the most general spontaneous tensorization theory which also has potentially dangerous higher derivative terms in the jordan frame. we address this problem by showing that the equations of motion have at most second order time derivatives. in arxiv:1901.00194v1 1 jan 2019 2 the last section, we summarize and discuss our results. ii. changing the frame in scalar-tensor theories the most elementary case to compare the einstein and jordan frames is the brans dicke theory which was first introduced in the jordan frame 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {greek capital letter phi} {small tilde} r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {greek small letter omega} {greek capital letter phi} {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek capital letter phi} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter phi} + sm where {greek capital letter phi} is the scalar field, {small tilde} r is the ricci scalar associated with the jordan frame metric {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, and fm denotes any matter degrees of freedom in the spacetime with their respective action sm. {greek small letter omega} = constant for bd, but it can be generalized to obtain other stts, for example {greek small letter omega} = -3/2 -1/ with a negative constant beta gives the spontaneous scalarization of def . eq. 1 deviates from the action of a scalar field minimally coupled to gr by the {greek capital letter phi} factor in the einsteinhilbert-like first term, and by the non-canonical scalar field action. the former issue can be addressed by expressing the action in terms of another metric which is conformally related the the original, g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = a-2 {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, since then {small tilde} r = a-2r -6g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}a-3 {nabla} {micro sign} {nabla} {greek small letter nu}a {left right double arrow}r = a2 {small tilde} r + 6 {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}a-1 {small tilde} {nabla} {micro sign} {small tilde} {nabla} {greek small letter nu}a which can be shown by straightforward calculation of the ricci scalar in 4 spacetime dimensions. here, all quantities with a tilde are related to {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, and bare ones are related to g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}.1 remembering that {small tilde} g = a4g and {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = a-2g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, we immediately see that the choice {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = {greek capital letter phi}-1g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, puts the action in the form 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g x14 r -3/2 {greek capital letter phi}2 g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek capital letter phi} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter phi} x15 -1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g {greek small letter omega}

phi} + sm x02 fm, {greek capital letter phi}-1g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} x03 up to boundary terms. the first term is exactly that of gr as we desired. the second problem of having a non-canonical scalar action can also be addressed by using our freedom to redefine the scalar field. introducing {greek small letter phi} such that d {greek capital letter phi} d {greek small letter phi} = s 4 {greek capital letter phi}2 3 + 2 {greek small letter omega} 1 our tilde convention follows def and the spontaneous scalarization/tensorization literature. the opposite is sometimes employed e.g. in . finally puts the action into the commonly used einstein frame form 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g 2g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek small letter phi} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter phi} + sm x02 fm, a2g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} x03 . we call a {identical to})-1/2 the conformal scaling function. all the alternative nature of this action is in its matter coupling, the first two terms simply represent a scalar field living under gr. the price to have these familiar action terms is the nonminimal matter coupling. for the bd and def theories, the scalar field redefinitions are {greek capital letter phi} = exp r 4 3 + 2 {greek small letter omega} {greek small letter phi} ! , {greek capital letter phi} = exp x00-beta {greek small letter phi}2x01 respectively. iii. jordan frame in theories of spontaneous vectorization a close examination of the def theory in eq. 5 shows that one can get similar alternative theories of gravity by replacing the scalar by a vector as 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g g {micro sign} {greek small letter rho}g {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter sigma}f {greek small letter rho} {greek small letter sigma}f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} + sm x02 fm, a2 xg {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} x03 , x = g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}x {micro sign}x {greek small letter nu} , where x {micro sign} is a vector field that governs gravity in addition to the metric, similarly to the scalar field in stts, and f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = {nabla} {micro sign}x {greek small letter nu} - {nabla} {greek small letter nu}x {micro sign} = {partial differential} {micro sign}x {greek small letter nu} - {partial differential} {greek small letter nu}x {micro sign}. we keep all vector-related quantities in the lower index to explicitly see the the inverse metric terms. it is clear from this presentation why einstein frame is more suitable to generalize stts to vectors or other fields. both the metric and the scalar field actions are in their standard forms, hence one keeps the einstein-hilbert action and replaces the action of the scalar with the standard action for a vector field to obtain a vector-tensor theory.2 whereas, it is hard to see how to change the unusual scalar field terms in the jordan frame of eq. 1 to those of vectors. in eq. 7, modification to gr comes in the form of a confomal scaling of the metric that interacts with matter fields, just as for the def or bd theories. then our only choice is the function ax. it has been shown that ax = ebetaxx/2 with a constant betax or a similar function whose leading behavior around 0 is second order in its argument x leads 2 in the original formulation the vector is massive to conform to some possible observational bounds . however, intrinsic mass of vectors or scalars do not a {latin small ligature ff}ect the current discussion. 3 to spontaneously growing vector fields in the vicinity of neutron stars in analogy to spontaneous scalarization. remembering that we define the jordan frame of a theory as where the metric couples minimally to the matter fields, we want to express the action in terms of {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = a2 x g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} for which the action becomes 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {macron} a-2 x {small tilde} r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter rho} {small tilde} g {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter sigma}f {greek small letter rho} {greek small letter sigma}f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} + 6 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {macron} a-1 x {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {macron} a-1 x + sm . {macron} ax is simply ax, but now implicitly defined as a function of the field variables in the new frame by {macron} ax = ax . for example, the exponential function we used before now means {macron} a2 x = ebetax {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}x {micro sign}x {greek small letter nu} {macron} a2 x . the implicit definition in eq. 9 is unappealing, and more importantly cannot be always inverted for given { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, x {micro sign}}, rendering the theory meaningless for such values in the jordan frame. we will discuss this issue in more detail in the coming sections, but we can address it for this specific theory by utilizing the freedom to redefine the vector field. consider {small tilde} x {micro sign} {identical to} {macron} axx {micro sign} . now we can re-express ax as a function of {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} and {small tilde} x {micro sign} as {small tilde} ax = ax , that is {small tilde} ax has the exact same functional form as ax, but for a di {latin small ligature ff}erent set of variables. for the exponential function we considered before {small tilde} ax = ebetax {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} x {micro sign} {small tilde} x {greek small letter nu}/2 . thus, one can transform from one frame and set of field variables to the other in the straightforward manner {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = a2 xg {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = {small tilde} a-2 x {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} x {micro sign} = axx {micro sign} x {micro sign} = {small tilde} a-1 x {small tilde} x {micro sign} ax = ebetaxg {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}x {micro sign}x {greek small letter nu}/2 {small tilde} ax = ebetax {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} x {micro sign} {small tilde} x {greek small letter nu}/2 the transformation {g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, x {micro sign}} {left right arrow}{ {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {small tilde} x {micro sign}} is invertible. we will see that this is not always the case in other generalizations of stts. finally, the jordan frame action in terms of the new variables { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {small tilde} x {micro sign}} is given by 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} a-2 x {small tilde} r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} a-2 x {small tilde} f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} -2 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} a-2 x {small tilde} {greek capital letter lamda}2 x x14 {small tilde} {nabla} {micro sign} {small tilde} x {small tilde} {nabla} {micro sign} {small tilde} x -2 + 2 {small tilde} {greek capital letter lamda}-1 x {small tilde} {nabla} {micro sign} {small tilde} x x15 + sm , where {small tilde} f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {identical to} {small tilde} {nabla} {micro sign} {small tilde} x {greek small letter nu} - {small tilde} {nabla} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} x {micro sign}, {small tilde} x {identical to} {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} x {micro sign} {small tilde} x {greek small letter nu}, {small tilde} {greek capital letter lamda}x {identical to} {small tilde} a-1 x and all raising is performed with {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}. the action for the vector field is not the standard one, but this is expected in the jordan frame as in eq. 1. we should note that the actions in eq. 8 and eq. 15 both satisfy our definition of the jordan frame since they both have minimal matter coupling. however, we will prefer the latter since it does not su {latin small ligature ff}er from the nonexistence of {macron} ax for certain field values in eqs. 9, 10, hence we consider { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {small tilde} x {micro sign}} to provide a more natural setting for the jordan frame. {small tilde} x carries three degrees of freedom rather than the usual two in maxwell fields since it lacks the gauge freedom {small tilde} x {micro sign} {rightwards arrow} {small tilde} x {micro sign}+ {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek small letter lamda}. we can consider the degree of freedom in the norm {small tilde} x separately, and view {small tilde} x {micro sign} as carrying the remaining two. thus, we can treat {small tilde} x as an independent scalar which couples to the vector action {small tilde} f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} f {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} in addition to the gravity term {small tilde} r. this is reminiscent of einstein-maxwell-scalar theories, especially the ones that feature a newly discovered type of spontaneous scalarization . this might lead to an alternative understanding of the vectorization process through the scalar degree of freedom in {small tilde} x, and provide new connections between spontaneous vectorization and spontaneous scalarization. note that one can also define {small tilde} {greek small letter chi} = {small tilde} a-2 x and express eq. 15 in somewhat closer resemblance to eq. 1 where {small tilde} {greek small letter chi} would behave like a scalar. iv. jordan frame for ghost-based spontaneous scalarization a second avenue to generalize spontaneous growth of def is using a di {latin small ligature ff}erent instability, as opposed to using a di {latin small ligature ff}erent field. more concretely, the tachyonic can be replaced by a ghost if the conformal scaling depends on the derivative terms in the action 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g 2g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek small letter phi} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter phi} + sm x02 fm, a2 {partial differential}g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} x03 , k {identical to}g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek small letter phi} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter phi} . the resulting theory leads to scalarization of neutron stars, e.g for the choice a {partial differential} = ebeta {partial differential}k/2 with some constant beta {partial differential}. this theory is named ghost-based spontaneous scalarization since it can be shown that small perturbations around the scalar field vacuum behave like 4 a ghost, but this instability is suppressed as the field grows. using eq. 2, we can transform to the jordan frame with {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = a2 {partial differential}g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} a-2 {partial differential} {small tilde} r 2 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} a-2 {partial differential} {small tilde} k + 6 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} g

differential} + sm , {small tilde} k {identical to} {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek small letter phi} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {greek small letter phi} . {small tilde} a {partial differential} is defined implicitly through {small tilde} a {partial differential} = a {partial differential} {small tilde} k) , e.g. the exponential conformal scaling above leads to3 {small tilde} a2 {partial differential}= ebeta {partial differential} {small tilde} k {small tilde} a2 {partial differential}. even though this jordan frame formulation looks quite similar to that of the vector field case in eq. 8 and 9, it brings in new issues to tackle. first, eq. 17 contains terms with more than one time derivatives of {greek small letter phi} through {partial differential} {micro sign} {small tilde} a {partial differential}, which might indicate an unphysical nature due to ostrogradsky's theorem . this is peculiar, since we do not expect the nature of the theory to change radically from one frame to the other, and there are no higher time derivative terms in the einstein frame formulation in eq. 16. this puzzle can be resolved by considering the equations of motion in the jordan frame {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = 8 {greek small letter pi} {small tilde} a2 {partial differential}

differential}. these equations indeed have up to fourth order time derivatives indicative of ill-posedness. however, the trace of the first equation gives 6 {small tilde} a {partial differential} {small tilde} {white square} {small tilde} a-1 {partial differential} - {small tilde} r = 8 {greek small letter pi} {small tilde} a2 {partial differential} {small tilde} t -2 {small tilde} k -4 {small tilde} {greek capital letter lamda} {partial differential} {small tilde} k2 1 + 2 {small tilde} {greek capital letter lamda} {partial differential} {small tilde} k . hence, as long as the stress energy tensor of matter is first order, 6 {small tilde} a {partial differential} {small tilde} {white square} {small tilde} a-1 {partial differential} - {small tilde} r can be re-expressed in terms of first derivatives, and {partial differential}2 t {small tilde} a {partial differential}can be re-expressed in terms 3 we can have an explicit definition in this specific case in terms of the relatively well-known lambert w function w {identical to}x: {small tilde} a {partial differential} = q w/. however, the definition is implicit for generic a {partial differential}. of at most second time derivatives of {greek small letter phi} and {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}. inserting these identities back ensures that eq. 20 contains at most second time derivatives . the second issue in the jordan frame formulation is the implicit definition of {small tilde} a {partial differential}in eq. 18 which does not necessarily have a solution for all {small tilde} k for a given a {partial differential}. for example, the exponential function we discussed only provides a solution for {small tilde} a {partial differential}if beta {partial differential} {small tilde} k < e-1 and is multi-valued for positive beta {partial differential} {small tilde} k. this also implies that it is not always possible to invert {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} to g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}. in some sense, all possible values of { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {greek small letter phi}} is too big a configuration space for our theory. this is not the case for all {small tilde} a {partial differential}, for example the choice a {partial differential} = e {greek small letter gamma} {partial differential}k2 leads to a {small tilde} a {partial differential} defined for all {small tilde} k values . non-invertibility of the frame transformation is not a new problem, and is present in the simplest stts such as bd as well. in eq. 1, {greek capital letter phi} is constrained to be positive. field variables cannot be transformed to the jordan frame otherwise due to eq. 6, and the action also becomes meaningless for the def theory due to the logarithmic terms in {greek small letter omega}. nevertheless, we would still want to have an invertible transformation between frames for as much of the configuration space as possible. note that we encountered the non-invertibility problem in vector-tensor theories as well , but the redefinition of the vector field, x {micro sign} {rightwards arrow} {small tilde} x {micro sign} resolved the issue by providing a fully invertible transformation between the frames in eq. 14. in other words, the full range of {small tilde} x {micro sign} was just right for our theory while that of x {micro sign} was too big. we were not able to construct any such redefinition {greek small letter phi} {rightwards arrow} {small tilde} {greek small letter phi} in the current case. as an example, the most obvious candidate {partial differential} {micro sign} {small tilde} {greek small letter phi} {identical to} {small tilde} a {partial differential} {partial differential} {micro sign} {greek small letter phi} leads to the explicit definition {small tilde} a {partial differential}= a {partial differential} and a fully invertible tranformation between frames. however, this also implies {partial differential} {micro sign} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} {greek small letter phi} {combining long solidus overlay}= {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {small tilde} {greek small letter phi}, hence such a differentiable {small tilde} {greek small letter phi} does not exist. a related problem to the nonexistence of {small tilde} a {partial differential}for certain field values would be the following: if we start with some initial data { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {greek small letter phi}} and their first derivatives in the jordan frame for which {small tilde} a {partial differential}is defined, does the time evolution lead to values of { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {greek small letter phi}} for which {small tilde} a {partial differential}is defined everywhere in the future of the initial data? since the non-existence of a {partial differential}is not a problem in the einstein frame for any values of {g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {greek small letter phi}}, we would expect the answer to be a {latin small ligature ffi}rmative. a proper analysis requires tools from the theory of partial di {latin small ligature ff}erential equations, and we hope mathematical physics can provide some insight for this problem which has not been addressed in the gravitational physics literature to the best of our knowledge. lastly, the fact that the equations of motion are ultimately second order in time derivatives in the jordan frame may suggests that there is also a field redefinition that would allow the action to contain only first order derivatives, but we could not identify a simple example 5 of this aside from the trivial transformation of going back to the einstein frame. v. jordan frame for generic spontaneous tensorization we have seen that spontaneous growth can be generalized from scalars to vectors, or from a tachyonbased mechanism to a ghost-based mechanism. this approach can be continued to various other fields such as spinors , other mechanisms such as spontaneous growth through the higgs mechanism , or any combination of them. all these form the family of spontaneous tensorization theories. how generic are the issues of higher time derivatives and invertibility of frame transformations that we encountered in sec. iv? if they appear in a generic spontaneous tensorization theory, can they be resolved similarly to the case of ghost-based spontaneous scalarization? consider the following general action for which all the theories we have investigated so far are special cases 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x {square root}-g l {greek small letter psi} + sm x02 fm, a2 {greek small letter psi}g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} x03 . here, {greek small letter psi} is any field, potentially with multiple tensor indices, and {partial differential} {greek small letter psi} is a collective symbol for its first derivatives. the jordan frame of such a theory is obtained by {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = a2 {greek small letter psi}g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} which has the action 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} a-2 {greek small letter psi} {small tilde} r 1 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} l {greek small letter psi} + 6 16 {greek small letter pi} z d4x p - {small tilde} g {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} {partial differential} {micro sign} {small tilde} a-1 {greek small letter psi} {partial differential} {greek small letter nu} {small tilde} a-1 {greek small letter psi} + sm . where {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} is defined implicitly as {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} = a {greek small letter psi} , and {small tilde} l {greek small letter psi} = {small tilde} a-4 {greek small letter psi} l {greek small letter psi} . the crucial point is that, {small tilde} l {greek small letter psi} and {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} are still only functions of at most the first derivatives of {greek small letter psi}. the equations of motion in the jordan frame are {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} = 8 {greek small letter pi} {small tilde} a2 {greek small letter psi} {small tilde} t {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} -2 {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} -2 {small tilde} a-1 {greek small letter psi}

tilde} a {greek small letter psi} {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter psi} -1 2 {greek small letter delta} {small tilde} l {greek small letter psi} {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter psi} . the second equation contains the fourth derivative term {small tilde} {nabla} {micro sign} {small tilde} {white square} {small tilde} a-1 {greek small letter psi} and both equations have third time derivatives of {greek small letter psi}. both cases are potentially problematic. however, the trace of the first equation implies 6 {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} {small tilde} {white square} {small tilde} a-1 {greek small letter psi} - {small tilde} r = 8 {greek small letter pi} {small tilde} t {small tilde} a2 {greek small letter psi} {square root}- {small tilde} g {greek small letter delta} {greek small letter delta} {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} 1 + 2 {small tilde} a-1 {greek small letter psi} {greek small letter delta} {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} {greek small letter delta} {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu} , in complete analogy to eq. 21. 6 {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} {small tilde} {white square} {small tilde} a-1 {greek small letter psi} - {small tilde} r can be expressed in terms of at most first derivatives of the fundamental field variables { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {greek small letter psi}} as long as {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi}, {small tilde} l {greek small letter psi} and matter stress-energy contain at most first derivatives. this in turn means {partial differential}2 t {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} can also be expressed in terms of at most two time derivatives. hence, changing from the einstein frame , to the jordan frame does not introduce ill-posedness. note that our starting action eq. 23 in the einstein frame is general enough to contain potential self interaction terms for {greek small letter psi} in l, and a conformal scaling a {greek small letter psi} that depends both on {greek small letter psi} and its derivatives. thus, our results continue to hold for the spontaneous growth of massive scalars or vectors, or theories where ghost-based and tachyon-based instabilities are present at the same time. it is also trivial to generalize the result to a collection if fields {greek small letter psi}. these cover all examples of spontaneous tensorization in the literature . all these theories, aside from spontaneous vectorization in sec. iii, also contain conformal scaling functions which contain derivatives. hence, the resolution of the higher time derivative problem we outlined is central to their viability in the jordan frame as physical theories. invertibility of the frame transformation in relation to the existence of a solution to eq. 26 for {small tilde} a {greek small letter psi} is not resolved in general. all possible values of {greek small letter psi} provide too big a configuration space in the jordan frame, and the questions we posed in sec. iv are open in this generic case as well. however, we remind that such problems are present even in the def theory.

    "Text": "we studied the jordan frame formulation of generalizations of stts, where the scalar is replaced with other fields, and couplings can depend on derivatives. our motivation came from the specific class of theories that feature spontaneous tensorization. these are most naturally defined in the einstein frame where the action for the additional field to the metric is in the canonical form. however, our results can be applied to any generalization of stts that is based on a conformal scaling of the metric in the matter action by some function of a dynamical field and its first derivatives. the first case we examined is the vector-tensor theory obtained by replacing the scalar in the def theory by a vector where the conformal scaling function ax depends on the norm of the vector field. a completely invertible transformation can be obtained if the vector field is redefined in the jordan frame, x {micro sign} {rightwards arrow} {small tilde} x {micro sign} = axx {micro sign}, as well as the metric. moreover, interesting connections can be observed to the recently discovered spontaneous growth in einstein-maxwell-scalar theories . jordan frame of ghost-based spontaneous scalarization where the conformal scaling depends on the derivatives of the scalar field presents challenges. first, the jordan frame contains higher derivative terms indicative of illposedness due to ostrogradsky's theorem, which is odd since this is not an issue in the einstein frame, and we would not expect the nature of the theory to change in such radical fashion due to a frame change. the equations of motion indeed contain up to fourth order time derivatives, but it can be shown that such terms cancel each other to render the equations second order in time. it is also curious to see that the conformal scaling function cannot be defined for all values of the field variables { {small tilde} g {micro sign} {greek small letter nu}, {greek small letter phi}} which causes the transformation between frames to be non-invertible. we could not find a formulation where this problem is resolved, but noted that this is the case even in the def theory where the scalar field is restricted to be positive in the jordan frame. it is important to understand the meaning of the field values in the jordan frame where the transformation back to the einstein frame is not defined, which we leave to future studies. we finally showed that a generic spontaneous tensorization theory contains higher time derivative terms in its formulation, much like ghost-based spontaneous scalarization. the equations of motion are again ultimately rendered second order in time, even though they naively contain fourth time derivatives, demonstrating that the jordan frame formulation does not introduce illposedness. we should add at this point that the fact that there are only first derivative terms in the einstein frame action does not guarantee well-posedness. a theory can be rendered unphysical by other factors such as indefinitely growing fields such as ghosts, even if the equations of motion have no more than two time derivatives. the einstein frame formulation of spontaneous tensorization theories are not known to be completely free of such undesirable features , but our work here shows that transferring to the jordan frame at least does not add new sources of ill-posedness. certain calculations on stts have been performed using the jordan frame such as the gravitational wave memory for the def theory . consequently, we believe this study will enable researchers to extend similar work to spontaneous tensorization in general. possibility of nearfuture testing is a basic appeal of spontaneous scalarization and tensorization. calculations of specific observational signs will enable the gravity community to compare the predictions of these theories to actual observations, and understand the di {latin small ligature ff}erences between individual theories in the spontaneous tensorization family. acknowledgments this project started with a question posed by leonardo gualtieri to whom we are grateful. the author is supported by grant no. 117f295

    "Text": "sparse bounds for di {latin small ligature ff}erent operators have been a recent and active topic in harmonic analysis. their remarkable feature is that an operator, which is typically signed and non-local, is dominated by a positive and localized expression of the form x qbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}p,q {greek small letter chi}q, where {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}p p,q = 1 |q| r q |f|p, and s is a sparse family of cubes of rn. recall that the family of cubes s is called {greek small letter eta}-sparse, 0 < {greek small letter eta} {less-than or equal to}1, if for every cube q belong to s, there exists a measurable set eq {subset of}q such that |eq| {greater-than or equal to} {greek small letter eta}|q|, and the sets {eq}qbelong to s are pairwise disjoint. localization and sparseness are two main ingredients which make sparse bounds especially e {latin small ligature ff}ective in quantitative weighted norm inequalities. the literature about sparse bounds is too extensive to be given here in more or less adequate form. we mention only that sparse bounds for calder on-zygmund operators can be found in . also, there are several general sparse domination principles . in , a sparse domination principle was obtained in terms of the grand maximal truncated operator

a . assume that t is a sublinear operator of weak type and mt is of weak type , where 1 {less-than or equal to}q {less-than or equal to}r < {infinity}. then, for every compactly supported f belong to lr, there exists a sparse family s such that |tf| {less-than or equal to}c x qbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}r,q {greek small letter chi}q for a.e. x belong to rn, where c = cn,q,r. in this paper we improve the above result by means of weakening the two main hypotheses. first, instead of the weak type of t we assume a weaker property that there exists a non-increasing function {greek small letter psi}t,q, 0 < {greek small letter lamda} < 1, such that for every cube q and for every f belong to lq, |{x belong to q : |t| > {greek small letter psi}t,q {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}q,q}| {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}|q| . we call this the wq property. if t is of weak type , then the wq property holds with {greek small letter psi}t,q = {parallel to}t {parallel to}lq {rightwards arrow}lq, {infinity} {greek small letter lamda}-1/q. second, we replace the operator mt by a more flexible operator m# t, {greek small letter alpha} defined for {greek small letter alpha} > 0 by m# t, {greek small letter alpha}f = sup q {contains as member}x ess sup x {prime},x {prime} {prime}belong to q |t -t|. our main result is the following. theorem 1.1. let t be a sublinear operator satisfying the wq condition and such that m# t, {greek small letter alpha} is of weak type for some {greek small letter alpha} {greater-than or equal to}3, where 1 {less-than or equal to}q, r < {infinity}. let s = max. then, for every compactly supported f belong to ls, there exists a 1 2 {middle dot} {greek small letter alpha}n-sparse family s such that |tf| {less-than or equal to}c x qbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q {greek small letter chi}q for a.e. x belong to rn, where c = cn,r,s, {greek small letter alpha} x00 {greek small letter psi}t,qn)+ {parallel to}m# t {parallel to}lr {rightwards arrow}lr, {infinity}x01 . theorem 1.1 provides a more convenient tool compared to theorem a. indeed, there is no need now to work with the grand maximal truncated operator mt, which typically requires some additional effort. in many particular cases the weak type of m# t, {greek small letter alpha} follows from the estimate m# t, {greek small letter alpha}f {less-than or equal to}cmrf, where mrf = m1/r and m is the hardy-littlewood maximal operator. the fact that we do not require the weak type of t in theorem 1.1 allows us to obtain a sparse domination result for a singular pointwise sparse domination 3 integral operator t with minimal set of assumptions close in the spirit to the t1 theorem. the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we present a proof of theorem 1.1. we also show separately how this proof looks in the model case of calder on-zygmund operators. in section 3 we discuss some variations and extensions of theorem 1.1. a sparse t1-type result is presented in section 4. finally, in section 5 we collect di {latin small ligature ff}erent examples of operators admitting the pointwise sparse domination. we show how theorem 1.1 simplifies sparse bounds for these operators.",

    "Text": "1.1 in this section we prove theorem 1.1. the proof is a variation of the proof of theorem a, with an additional twist. although some parts of both proofs are almost identical, we provide a complete proof for reader's convenience. first, we separate a common ingredient of both proofs in the following lemma. lemma 2.1. assume that for any compactly supported f belong to ls and for every cube q, there exists a 1 2-sparse family fq of subcubes of q such that for a.e. x belong to q, |t| {greek small letter chi}q {less-than or equal to}c x rbelong to fq {mathematical left angle bracket}f

belong to rn, |tf| {less-than or equal to}c x rbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s,r {greek small letter chi}r. proof. take a partition of rn by cubes qj such that supp {subset of} {greek small letter alpha}qj for each j. for example, take a cube q0 such that supp {subset of}q0 and cover 3q0 q0 by 3n -1 congruent cubes qj. each of them satisfies q0 {subset of}3qj {subset of} {greek small letter alpha}qj. next, in the same way cover 9q0 3q0, and so on. the union of resulting cubes, including q0, will satisfy the desired property. having such a partition, apply to each qj instead of q. we obtain a 1 2-sparse family fqj such that for a.e. x belong to qj, |tf| {less-than or equal to}c x rbelong to fqj {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s, {greek small letter alpha}r {greek small letter chi}r. therefore, setting f = {union}jfqj, we obtain that f is 1 2-sparse and for a.e. x belong to rn, |tf|

ombrosi this proves with a 1 2 {middle dot} {greek small letter alpha}n-sparse family s = { {greek small letter alpha}r : r belong to f}. {white square} before giving the proof of theorem 1.1, we show that it especially elementary in the model case of calder on-zygmund operators. we say that t is a calder on-zygmund operator if t is a linear operator of weak type such that tf = z rn kfdy for all x

|x -x {prime}| < |x -y|/2, where dini = r 1 0 {greek small letter omega} dt t < {infinity}. theorem 2.2. let t be a calder on-zygmund operator. for every compactly supported f belong to l1, there exists a 1 2 {middle dot}n-sparse family s such that for a.e. x belong to rn, |tf| {less-than or equal to}cn x qbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}1,q {greek small letter chi}q. this result is well known . its proof in is based on theorem a. the proof given below illustrates in a simplified form the main idea behind the proof of theorem 1.1. proof of theorem 2.2. given a cube q, denote q*= 5 {square root}nq. let us also use the notation fq = 1 |q| r q f. it follows from the smoothness condition in the standard way that for every cube p and for

    "Text": "1.1 we mention here some simple but useful variations/extensions of theorem 1.1. let us start with the following, a slightly more precise version of theorem 1.1. pointwise sparse domination 7 theorem 3.1. let 1 {less-than or equal to}q, r < {infinity}and s = max. let f be a compactly supported function from ls. assume that t is a sublinear operator satisfying the following property: there exist non-increasing functions {greek small letter psi} and {greek phi symbol} such that for any cube q, |{x belong to q : |t| > {greek small letter psi} {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}q,q}| {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}|q| and |{x belong to q : m# t, {greek small letter alpha} > {greek phi symbol} {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}r,q}| {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}|q| for some {greek small letter alpha} {greater-than or equal to}3. then there exists a 1 2 {middle dot} {greek small letter alpha}n-sparse family s such that |tf| {less-than or equal to}c x qbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q {greek small letter chi}q for a.e. x belong to rn, where c = cn,s x10 {greek small letter psi}n) + {greek phi symbol}n) x11 . indeed, the only di {latin small ligature ff}erence in the proof is in the definition of a, namely, one should define a = 2 x10 {greek small letter psi}n) + {greek phi symbol}n) x11 . with this choice of a we have |{x belong to q : f mt > a {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q*}| {less-than or equal to} 1 6 {middle dot} 2n|q|, and hence one can bound | {ohm sign}| by 1 2n+2|q|. remark 3.2. the advantage of theorem 3.1 compared to theorem 1.1 is not only in the weaker assumption on m# t, {greek small letter alpha} but also in the fact that the sparse domination for an individual function f follows from the initial assumptions on the same function. this advantage will be used in theorem 4.1 below. our next remark is that the {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}p,q averages in theorems 1.1 and 3.1 can be replaced by the orlicz averages defined for a young function {greek capital letter phi} by {parallel to}f {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi},q = inf n {greek small letter lamda} > 0 : 1 |q| z q {greek capital letter phi}|/ {greek small letter lamda})dy {less-than or equal to}1 o . for example, the corresponding variant of theorem 3.1 can be stated as follows. theorem 3.3. let {greek capital letter phi} and {greek capital letter theta} be young functions such that {greek capital letter theta} {less-than or equal to} c {greek capital letter phi} for all t {greater-than or equal to}t0 {greater-than or equal to}0. let f be a compactly supported function from the orlicz space l {greek capital letter phi}. assume that t is a sublinear operator satisfying the following property: there exist non-increasing functions {greek small letter psi} and {greek phi symbol} such that for any cube q, |{x belong to q : |t| > {greek small letter psi} {parallel to}f {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi},q}| {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}|q| 8 andrei k. lerner and sheldy ombrosi and |{x belong to q : m# t, {greek small letter alpha} > {greek phi symbol} {parallel to}f {parallel to} {greek capital letter theta},q}| {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}|q| for some {greek small letter alpha} {greater-than or equal to}3. then there exists a 1 2 {middle dot} {greek small letter alpha}n-sparse family s such that |tf| {less-than or equal to}c x qbelong to s {parallel to}f {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi},q {greek small letter chi}q for a.e. x belong to rn, where c = cn, {greek capital letter phi}, {greek capital letter theta} x10 {greek small letter psi}n) + {greek phi symbol}n) x11 . indeed, it is easy to see that {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q appears in the sparse domination estimate in theorem 3.1 just because, by h {diaeresis} older's inequality, max {less-than or equal to} {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q. now, the assumption {greek capital letter theta} {less-than or equal to}c {greek capital letter phi} implies {parallel to}f {parallel to} {greek capital letter theta},q {less-than or equal to}c {parallel to}f {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi},q. therefore, replacing {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q by {parallel to}f {parallel to} {greek capital letter phi},q in the proof of theorems 1.1/3.1, we obtain theorem 3.3. for an application of theorem 3.3, see example 5.4 in section 5. we also note that theorem 3.1 can be easily extended to a multilinear case. in , a multilinear extension of theorem a was obtained. our multilinear variant of theorem 3.1 improves this result exactly in the same way as theorem 3.1 improves theorem a. denote {combining right arrow above} f = and {combining right arrow above} f {greek small letter chi}q = . given an operator t and {greek small letter alpha} > 0, define a multilinear analogue of the operator m# t, {greek small letter alpha} by m# t, {greek small letter alpha} = sup q {contains as member}x ess sup x {prime},x {prime} {prime}belong to q | x00t-t x01 x00t-t x01 |. theorem 3.4. let 1 {less-than or equal to}q, r < {infinity}and s = max. let fj, j = 1, . . . , m, be compactly supported functions from ls, and let {combining right arrow above} f = . assume that t is an operator satisfying the following property: there exist non-increasing functions {greek small letter psi} and {greek phi symbol} such that for any cube q, |{x belong to q : |t| > {greek small letter psi} m y j=1 {mathematical left angle bracket}fj {mathematical right angle bracket}q,q}| {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}|q| and |{x belong to q : m# t, {greek small letter alpha} > {greek phi symbol} m y j=1 {mathematical left angle bracket}fj {mathematical right angle bracket}r,q}| {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter lamda}|q| for some {greek small letter alpha} {greater-than or equal to}3. then there exists a 1 2 {middle dot} {greek small letter alpha}n-sparse family s such that |t {combining right arrow above} f| {less-than or equal to}c x qbelong to s m y j=1 {mathematical left angle bracket}fj {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q {greek small letter chi}q pointwise sparse domination 9 for a.e. x belong to rn, where c = cn,s x10 {greek small letter psi}n) + {greek phi symbol}n) x11 . we point out the necessary changes in the proof compared to the proof of theorem 3.1. first, instead of msf one should consider ms = sup q {contains as member}x m y j=1 {mathematical left angle bracket}fj {mathematical right angle bracket}s,q. second, t should be replaced by t -t. the rest of the proof is identically the same. note that in theorem 3.4, similarly to the corresponding result in , we do not assume that t is multilinear linear), which is in contrast to the statement of its linear analogue, theorem 3.1. the explanation is in the way we defined m# t, {greek small letter alpha} in the linear and multilinear cases. the only place where the sublinearity of t in theorems 1.1 and 3.1 was used is in the estimate |t| {less-than or equal to}|t| + |t|. having here t -t instead of |t|, this estimate would hold trivially without any assumption on t. thus, defining m# t, {greek small letter alpha} in the linear case in analogy with its multilinear analogue, one can state theorems 1.1 and 3.1 for arbitrary t.",

denote by hr the class of kernels satisfying the lr-h {diaeresis} ormander condition. it is easy to see that h1 is just the classical h {diaeresis} ormander condition, and that hr {subset of}hs if r > s. let t *denote the transpose of t, which is associated to the kernel k* = k. it is well known that if t is l2 bounded, represented by for any f belong to l2 and if k, k*belong to h1, then t is of weak type and is bounded on lp for every 1 < p < {infinity}. on the other hand, many results in the theory of singular integrals hold under stronger assumptions on k. recall that k is called standard 10 andrei k. lerner and sheldy ombrosi kernel if it satisfies the size condition |k| {less-than or equal to} c |x-y|n for x {combining long solidus overlay}= y and both k and k*satisfy the regularity

then t is l2 bounded if and only if there exists c > 0 such that for any cube q, z q |t {greek small letter chi}q|dx {less-than or equal to}c|q| and z q |t * {greek small letter chi}q|dx {less-than or equal to}c|q|. in , a sparse proof of the t1 theorem was given, namely the sparse domination for t was obtained assuming that k is standard and t satisfies . it is still unknown what are the minimal regularity conditions on k for which the t1 theorem holds. the sharpest known su {latin small ligature ffi}cient condition for the t1 theorem is for k and k*with z 1 0 {greek small letter omega} x10 1 + log 1 t x111/2dt t < {infinity} . in particular, it is unknown whether this condition can be relaxed to the classical dini condition. similarly, one can ask about the minimal assumptions on t yielding the pointwise sparse domination. our result in this direction is the following. we assume that k : rn * rn { : x belong to rn} is real valued, and that t represented by is properly defined on the space l {infinity} c of bounded functions with compact support. theorem 4.1. assume that k belong to hr for some 1 < r {less-than or equal to} {infinity}and that k*belong to h1. suppose that there exists c > 0 such that for every cube q and every measurable subset e {subset of}q, z q |t * {greek small letter chi}e|dx {less-than or equal to}c|q|. then for every f belong to l {infinity} c , there exists a 1 2 {middle dot}3n-sparse family s such that for a.e. x belong to rn, |tf| {less-than or equal to}c x qbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}r {prime},q {greek small letter chi}q. we collect several standard facts. first, the assumption k belong to hr along with h {diaeresis} older's inequality implies that for all x belong to rn, m# t,3f {less-than or equal to}cmr {prime}f. pointwise sparse domination 11 second, the assumption k*belong to h1 implies that for every cube q and any bounded function supported in q with r q f = 0, z rn2q |tf|dx {less-than or equal to}c z q |f|dx. the proof of the following lemma is almost the same as the standard proof of the weak type of t. lemma 4.2. let k*belong to h1. assume that there exist a, {greek small letter delta} > 0 such that for every cube q and any f belong to l {infinity}, |{x belong to q : |t| > {greek small letter alpha}}| {less-than or equal to}a x12 {parallel to}f {parallel

|f|q = 1. suppose also that {greek small letter alpha} > 1 since otherwise the statement is trivial. by the local calder on-zygmund decomposition, there exists a family of pairwise disjoint cubes {qj}

to l {infinity}, z q |t|dx = z q ft *x00 {greek small letter chi}q x01 dx {less-than or equal to}2c {parallel to}f {parallel to}l {infinity}|q|. therefore, by lemma 4.2, there is c {prime} > 1 such that for any f belong to l {infinity} c and for every cube q, |{x belong to q : |t| > {greek small letter alpha}|f|q}| {less-than or equal to}c {prime} {greek small letter alpha}1/2|q| . from this and from , by the weak type of mr {prime}, we obtain that both conditions of theorem 3.1 are satisfied for q = 1 and r {prime} instead of r for every f belong to l {infinity} c with corresponding functions {greek small letter psi} and {greek phi symbol} independent of f. applying theorem 3.1 completes the proof. {white square} note that for every {greek small letter eta}-sparse family s, x qbelong to s {mathematical left angle bracket}f {mathematical right angle bracket}r,q {greek small letter chi}q lp {less-than or equal to}cn,p,r, {greek small letter eta} {parallel to}f {parallel

bounded extension that maps l2 to itself if and only if condition holds. proof. the necessity part of this statement is obvious. thus, we only need to show the su {latin small ligature ffi}ciency part. by theorem 4.1 and by , for any p > r {prime} and for all f belong to l {infinity} c , {parallel to}tf {parallel to}lp {less-than or equal to}cn,p,r {parallel to}f {parallel to}lp. this along with implies the weak type property {parallel to}tf {parallel to}l1, {infinity} {less-than or equal to}c {parallel to}f {parallel to}l1 pointwise sparse domination 13 , and therefore, by interpolation, {parallel to}tf {parallel to}l2 {less-than or equal to}c {parallel to}f {parallel to}l2 , which implies that t can be extended continuously to a bounded mapping on l2. {white square} observe that condition can be written in an equivalent and more symmetric form as follows: there exists c > 0 such that for every cube q and any measurable subsets e, f {subset of}q, | {mathematical left angle bracket}t {greek small letter chi}e, {greek small letter chi}f {mathematical right angle bracket}| {less-than or equal to}c|q|. having in mind corollary 4.3, the question about the minimal regularity assumptions yielding the t1 theorem can be rephrased as follows: what are the minimal regularity assumptions on k for which the t1 conditions imply ? one can also ask whether the assumption k belong to hr, r > 1, in corollary 4.3 can be further improved to the minimal assumption k belong to h1.",

    "Text": "when available we utilize the updated planetary parameters provided by the california kepler survey and the asteroseismic updates provided by van eylen et al. . one of the main advantages for the inclusion of these updates is the improved planet radius measurements. since our study, like others, does not account for parameter uncertainty, such improvements are essential for accurate occurrence rates. where cks and asteroseismic data are unavailable, the measurements provided by the kepler dr25 catalog , in conjunction with the gaia dr2 radius updates , are implemented. through private communication, it was indicated that this early release of gaia data may contain some planet radius outliers. to combat this issue, we test the radius values against the kepler dr25 catalog. when the updated gaia measurements di {latin small ligature ff}er from the kepler dr25 data by > 3 {greek small letter sigma}, we utilize the kepler dr25 radius measurements. overall, 19 planets exceed this outlier limit . all period measurements are drawn from the light curves; thus, improved measurements from gaia and cks have no e {latin small ligature ff}ect on the inferred period measurements. we use the periods provided in the kepler dr25 catalogs. both the cks and kepler dr25 provide flags for false positives. we include data from both confirmed and candidate planets in dr25 and cksf p = false in the cks update. to further avoid contamination from false positives, we only include planets with periods .5 < p < 500 days and radii .5 < r < 16r {circled plus}. periods beyond 500 days have been noted to be highly contaminated by false positives because they barely meet the three transit limit of the pipeline . our period and radii range exceeds the conservative cuto {latin small ligature ff}s adopted by many previous studies, but is necessary when exploring the e {latin small ligature ff}ects of multiplicity. often planetary systems span the entire range of the kepler parameter space, thus the inclusion of nearly all the planets is needed for an accurate calculation. there exist 3 multi-planet systems where one planet within the system fall beyond the range of this study. we only select the planets from these system that lie within our radius and period cuts. the inclusion of these planets is useful mnras 000, 1-17 transit multiplicity in planet occurrence rates 3 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 mes 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 fraction detected 0.5 days < period < 200 days m = 1 m 2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 mes 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 fraction detected 200 days < period < 500 days m = 1 m 2 figure 1. the smoothed recovery fraction at each mes bin. the vertical lines represent the uncertainty in each bin under the assumption of a binary distribution. the bin values are plotted at the center of each bin. the solid lines represent the {greek capital letter gamma}c df distribution fit. the parameters of this model were fit using a {greek small letter chi}2 minimization. in providing a stronger statistical argument. although some of the known planets, in these 3 systems, extend beyond the bounds of this study, we expect many other systems within the dataset to contain planets beyond the range of our selection bounds. furthermore, if we include the planets that lay beyond our radius and period cuts, our analysis we will artificially inflate the number of inferred planets within this range. the accuracy of the kepler detection order can be a {latin small ligature ff}ected by systems with existing false positives. when removing these data points, we manually ensure that the detection order only reflects the order in which valid kois are detected. for example, a system with 5 real kois and 1 false positive would have detection orders ranging from 15 regardless of order at which the false positive was detected. it should be noted that these false positives do create cuts in the data, similar to that of a planet and therefore a {latin small ligature ff}ect the detection order. however, without reordering these systems we artificially inflate our multiplicity calculation in section 7. higher multiplicities are especially sensitive to mild increases as their detection probabilities are very low. further discussion in section 4 shows that we use the same detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency for all planets found after the first detected planet, thus only planets artificially being re-assigned to 1 are of concern. since most false positives provide relatively weak signals, only 14 systems experience this artificial re-ordering. after making the discussed cuts we find that the highest detection order existing in the parameter space is 7. this means that the highest system multiplicity we consider in this study is a 7 planet system. we find 3062 kois meet the indicated period and radius requirements. it has been suggested that gas giants eject companion planets while migrating inward . their large hill radius forces the planets to become unstable as the hill radius ratio falls below 10. these hot jupiters create an independent population of single planet systems . if it forms via a distinct channel, this population has the ability to skew the inferred distribution of the model for the generic underlying population. to minimize such contamination, we remove all single planet systems with r > 6.7r {circled plus}as indicated by ste {latin small ligature ff}en et al. . further evidence of this independent population was discussed by johansen et al. , who showed that multi-planet systems with one planet of mass > 0.1 jupiter mass are dynamically unstable on short timescales. this 0.1 jupiter mass limit roughly corresponds to the r = 6.7r {circled plus}limit used here. we find that 120 of these single hot jupiters exist in the dataset, leaving us with 2942 kois that fit all the parameter requirements described. our final catalog of planets and their corresponding parameters can be found online.2",

        "Text": "analytic models of transit probability have been found for double transit systems as a function of mutual inclination . however, larger multiplicity systems are more difficult and require semi-analytic models . in order to simplify our calculation, we simulate various semi-major axis to stellar radius ratios and look at 106 lines of sight to predict the probability of transit. to determine the period population we need a function for m transit probability at some semi-major axis value . in order to create a function for probability of transit in addition to m -1 other transits, it is essential that we know the distributions of exoplanet periods. clearly, this argument is circular in nature. we deal with this issue by using a non-uniform method of sampling from the empirical period population. this is performed for detection order m = 2 : 7, since the analytic probability is su {latin small ligature ffi}cient for m=1. to establish the desired detection order, the required number of planets are drawn from the empirical kepler period data. for example, when looking at the case of m=3, is selected and then the two additional planets are drawn from the known kepler mnras 000, 1-17 transit multiplicity in planet occurrence rates 5 period sample. the periods of the additional two planets are redrawn at each line of sight. this is the same as saying we marginalized the additional two planets over the kepler period population. in order to properly account for the transit probability of higher detection orders, we need to know the unbiased underlying populations of periods. to approximate this, we sample the empirical distribution of kepler planet periods, but weighted with a probability {proportional to}p2/3. this is done to account for the geometric bias against the detection of longer period planets. to account for the mutual inclination between orbits, we follow the {greek small letter sigma} {greek small letter sigma} distribution provided by fang & margot . this mild distribution was found by looking at the impact parameter ratios within kepler systems. once all orbits have been selected, the number of lines of sight where all planets transit is divided by 106 to establish the transit probability. to determine whether a planet is transiting this equation must be satisfied: cos *cos -sin *sin {greater-than or slanted equal to}r {star operator}/ap or sin *sin -cos *cos {less-than or slanted equal to}r {star operator}/ap where i is the inclination of the of the system and {greek small letter omega} is the ascending node. each line of sight is drawn uniformly over sin and the nodes of each orbit are also drawn uniformly over sin. for nodes between planets within the same system, we sample uniformly over sin. we note that equation 2 is only valid for circular orbits. consideration of eccentric orbits is presented in section 8.5. to avoid the creation of unstable systems, we check the planet separations . if any separation is < 10% the semi-major axis of the outer planet we resample the entire system. this process is repeated until no separations fall below the 10% threshold. although mutual hill radius would provide a better measure of stability, our metric requires no assumptions about the mass of the planets. furthermore, we find that changing this threshold makes little di {latin small ligature ff}erence to the probabilities calculated, indicating that stability accounting has little e {latin small ligature ff}ect statistically. the results of this simulation can be seen in figure 2. it is worth noting that equation 2 does not account for grazing transits. to properly account for this, r {star operator}must becomes r {star operator}+/- r, where r is the radius of the transiting planet. using a uniform distribution of r values from 0.5r {circled plus}to 16r {circled plus}, we find that grazing transits provide an increase of 0.2% to the overall transit probability. however, this uniform distribution is weighted far more heavily towards large planets than the underlying planet radius distribution, thus we expect the true correction to be much smaller. to properly account for grazing transit one must have some understanding of the underlying radius population. any attempt to do so here would add more uncertainty to the calculation and provide a very minimal correction. thus, we ignore such complications here.",

pwin is the probability that at least 3 transits will be detected by the available kepler data. since most targets have a duty = .95, short period transits produce a pwin nearly 1 and approach 0 as j < 3. almost all of our sample have data throughout the full data set span of 1458.931 days. the mean dataspan for this study is 1427.445 days. other studies have used various way to account for the e {latin small ligature ff}ects of limb darkening such as that of claret & bloemen . we attempt to mimic the pipeline by looking at the empirical limb darkening values chosen for existing kois . we find that the two limb darkening parameters used to fit planet transits within the pipeline are strongly correlated to stellar temperature . the best fit line to this correlation is as follows: u1 = -1.93 *10-4 *te {latin small ligature ff}+ 1.5169 u2 = 1.25 *10-4 *te {latin small ligature ff}-0.4601 we warn that these correlations mimic the choice of the pipeline rather than the true stellar features and should not be used for more evolved stars with log < 4. with the given calculated parameters, it is now possible to calculated the expected mes of the kepler pipeline as presented by burke & catanzarite . krp = r r {star operator} c0 = 1 - {greek small letter omega} = c0 4 + u1 + 2 *u2 6 -u2 8 depth = 1 - * 3 2 6 u2 8 ) {greek small letter omega}-1 mes = depth cdpp *106 *1.003 *n 1 2 tr where cdpp is in ppm from the kepler stellar catalog, interpolated by the transit duration. finally, we account for the systematic detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency using the gamma distribution cdf described in section 4. pm=1 tip = {greek capital letter gamma}m=1 cdf where the parameters for {greek capital letter gamma}cdf are the given in table 1. combining all of the discussed probabilities provides an estimate of the detection likelihood of the highest mes planet within the system. this probability is given as follows: pm=1 det = ptr *pwin *pm=1 tip this equation provides a metric for understanding the bias of the highest mes planet. this probability is dependent on detection order and we shall now discuss in the next section how higher multiplicity planets can be accounted for. 6.2 probability of detection for m {greater-than or slanted equal to}2 for m {greater-than or slanted equal to}2 planets we follow much of what is described in the previous section , with a few mild changes to better model the di {latin small ligature ff}erences in detection probability. we change the transit probability to reflect the probability of m planets transiting, accounting for the probability of finding this planet with at minimum m -1 other planets. to best capture the probabilities of our simulation in section 5.1, we interpolate between simulated data points for the transit probability. pm tr = linear interpolate mnras 000, 1-17 transit multiplicity in planet occurrence rates 7 for example, if we are looking at a planet with m=3 with ap/r {star operator}= 32, we would expect a transit probability of {tilde operator}0.008. this can be clearly seen in the data provided by figure 2. since no such simulated value exist at this exact point, we interpolate between the the two neighboring estimations to establish this value. here we use the new detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency for higher m planets. pm {greater-than or slanted equal to}2 tip = {greek capital letter gamma}m {greater-than or slanted equal to}2 cdf pm det = pm tr *pwin *pm {greater-than or slanted equal to}2 tip where equation 8 is again used for pwin. in reality, there are di {latin small ligature ff}ering window functions for each detection order; when tested, we find that {almost equal to}0.4% of the light curve is lost with the addition of each planet. one can see that varying the duty parameter of equation 8 by even 3% has negligible e {latin small ligature ff}ects on the pwin value. because the detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency is the same for m {greater-than or slanted equal to}2, the only di {latin small ligature ff}erence between the m = 2 : 7 probability maps is the transit probability. this now produced 7 distinct detection grids . the first four grids can be seen in figure 3. the detection order of the exoplanet in question will dictate which grid is most appropriate for application. to summarize, we have described how the recovery probabilities are a function of detection order . we use this to create 7 di {latin small ligature ff}erent detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency maps . in order to create a map for m=1 planets, we sample across planet period and radius space. doing so, we calculate the probability of detection and averaged over all stars within the kepler stellar sample. we expand upon this idea, creating a map for m=2 planets. here the new recovery cdf is implemented to account for the additional loss of planets at higher detection orders. furthermore, we account for the probability of two planets within the system transiting using a mild mutual inclination model . jumping from m=1 to m=2 we lose an additional 5.5% and 15.9% of the planets for periods < 200 days and periods > 200 days respectively. this is due to properties of the pipeline when fitting multiple transit systems. this procedure is repeated for m=3:7 each accounting for the appropriate number of transiting planets according to the data in figure 2 . there is an additional loss of nearly 70% at each respective discovery order due to the unlikely event of multiple orbital alignment with our line of sight. it is clear that these two factors, geometric transit likelihood and pipeline recovery, have a significant e {latin small ligature ff}ect on the multiplicity extracted from the kepler data set.",

the given detection order. the function om is the sorting order correction for the probability distribution function. this function is necessary to account for the bias in the pdf introduced by our sorting in terms of detection order . it is often more useful to consider the natural log of the likelihood, which can be simplified: ln {proportional to} 7 {latin capital letter o with tilde} m=1 -nm using the ln is common practice with fitting algorithms, where the ratio of likelihoods are compared to determine the best fit . since {greek small letter eta}m is not dependent on the fitting parameters it can be considered constant. 7.0.1 calculating nm to find {greek small letter eta}m we use the detection maps found in section 6.1 and 6.2. here we are assuming an average probability of detection over the stellar population. to properly treat this integral, one would have to compute the detection probability for each star. such a procedure would be computationally expensive and provide a minimal increase in precision. 7.0.2 sorting order here we will provide a brief overview of order statistics and why it is an important feature of this model. as mentioned previously, the kepler pipeline finds planets in order of decreasing mes. such ordering will skew the distribution of planets found in each m. larger, short period, planets will tend to be found in order m = 1 or m = 2, because there are more transits and deeper transit depths. smaller, long-period planets will tend towards orders m = 6 or m = 7. to account for such a skew, a joint distribution model ) can be utilized . pm {proportional to}p0c0am-1)bm-1 here, p0 is the true underlying probability distribution function and c0 is the true cumulative distribution function. am and bm can range from and forces the skew of the distribution. essentially, the pdf of the distribution is skewed by a beta distribution of the cdf. in the case of am = bm = 1 the sorting skew returns the original pdf ). the parameters am and bm can be found analytically for equally sampled orders, but becomes far more complex in the decreasing case at hand . to determine the best values for this case, we choose to simulate this sorting mechanism on a uniform distribution, where the skew can be clearly isolated and extracted. in doing so, we force the ratio of each m sample to mimic that of the empirical population. each system is then sorted by r2/p1/3, imitating kepler's mes sorting. for example, if a system of , , were randomly drawn into m = 1, 2, 3 detection orders, they would be re-sorted as , , corresponding to m = 1, 2, 3. as we can see, the highest mes will always rise to m = 1. this is then repeated for 107 systems. figure 4 shows how the first two detection orders are skewed by this procedure. if sorting were not an issue, these distributions would maintain the uniform flat appearance. fitting a beta distribution to this skew, we can determine the best am and bm parameters for our sample. these parameters are provided in table 2. since the this joint distribution is separable, we define the skew portion of the distribution as om. om = n *cram,r -1bm,r -1 *cpam, p-1bm, p-1 where cr and cp represents the cdf of the radius and period distributions respectively and n represents a normalization factor that we find numerically within the mcmc. 7.0.3 occurrence factor as noted, the value fm is an integrated occurrence factor. in order to extract meaningful values, we realize that many m = 6, 7 planet systems will only provide detectable transits for one or two planets within the system. this will lead to an increased contribution to lower detection orders. thus we adopt the following method for disentangling the true occurrence factors : fm = fm + 7 {latin capital letter o with tilde} n=m+1 fn p) p here p) represents the probability of finding planet n given that planets are not found and p is the probability of finding planet m. this ratio accounts for the dependence between occurrence factors. if the mutual inclination is purely isotropic and planets are truly independent this ratio would be one. we use our transit simulation from section 5.1 to extract these marginalized probabilities. table 3 contains the results from this simulation. this model indicates that each multi-planet system mnras 000, 1-17 transit multiplicity in planet occurrence rates 9 table 3. the mixture probabilities for each detection order. for example, this accounts for the possibility that two and three planet systems may only be found with a single planet. these values were found using our transit probability model described in section 5.1. m=1 m=2 m=3 m=4 m=5 m=6 p) p 0.67 p) p 0.68 0.50 p) p 0.53 1.05 0.50 p) p 0.53 1.12 1.52 0.46 p) p 0.37 1.07 1.85

planets.",

subject it to the detection constraints described in section 6. here we present the exomult forward modeling software. this code, developed in r, simulates these detection e {latin small ligature ff}ects and produces a population of detected planets. using this program, we can make far fewer assumptions and directly recover the expected population. for example, the probability of transit for all 7 planets can be directly accounted for by sampling system inclination, mutual inclination and the argument of periapsis directly. furthermore, the detection probability will not be marginalized over all stars, but rather reviewed for each system independently. the first step in our forward model is drawing each system of planets according to the population parameters given in figure 8. each system is randomly oriented with mutual inclinations drawn from a rayleigh distribution. for planets with detectable impact parameters , the planets within each system are sorted in decreasing mes. the probability of recovery is assigned to each planet according to the procedure laid out in sections 6.1 and 6.2. based on the calculated probability of detection, the planet is either detected or lost by drawing from a random number generator. figure 5 shows the best fit model to the observed population obtained with this forward model. it is clear the our bayesian method provides a reasonable model, where nearly all data points are within a 1 {greek small letter sigma} deviation of the observed distribution. fulton et al. and berger et al. have provided evidence for a dip in the radius population around 1.5 -2r {circled plus}. this gap is apparent in the m=1 case of figure 5. while the deviation from a broken power-law is mild, we explore the e {latin small ligature ff}ects here. when we remove the single planet systems from the data set, this gap is no longer apparent. one plausible explanation for this gap is a unique population of single planet systems shows that a weak gap can be seen in the multi-planet systems when aggregated). to explore this theory, we isolate the multi-planet systems and run our fitting procedure again. we find a mild di {latin small ligature

samples used for fitting . it is notable that the empirical kepler data set is sharply peaked, while the model does not provide a similar sharpness for the m = 1 radius population . this could be due

where {greek small letter kappa} and {greek small letter lamda} are both fit parameters. further discussion of this modified poisson distribution can be found in section 2.3 of fang & margot . the results of this fit are presented in figure 6. we find that {greek small letter lamda} = 8.40+/-0.31 and {greek small letter kappa} = 0.70+/-0.01 provide the best match for this distribution. this large {greek small letter lamda} value incorporates a non-negligible fraction of systems with m > 10. since equation 30 allows for an inflated number of star without planet, the global average for gk dwarfs in the kepler parameter space can be found by multiplying {greek small letter lamda}, an estimate of the average number of planets a planet harboring system will contain, by {greek small letter kappa}, the fraction of stars that do harbor planets. we find that {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}= 5.86 +/- 0.18 planets per star. this is likely a lower bound as we have excluded the single jupiter sized planets that have cleared their systems through migration. since these stars are currently assumed to have zero planets by this paper, inclusion of these additional planets would increase the {greek small letter kappa} value. however, we would expect our {greek small letter lamda} parameter to slightly decrease, with the inclusion of these additional singles, as this value only considers systems that do harbor planets. overall the increase in {greek small letter kappa} will dominate, leading to an overall increase in {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}. previous studies have averaged over multiplicity and inferred the {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}value alone. these values are more di {latin small ligature ffi}cult to compare as they are strongly dependent on the range of planet radius and period include in each study. looking at short period planets, youdin found {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}= 1.36. using our population parameters and making similar cuts we find a comparable value . turning the focus towards small planets and long periods , burke et al. found {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}= 0.73+/-.19 .07. when we apply these same bounds to our model we again find a slightly larger value . the most comparable parameter space to our study is that of traub , who finds {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}= 5.04 +/- .23 using a nearly identical parameter range. while there appears to be a mild tension with this value, we note that traub includes a much broader stellar temperature range and pre-gaia radius measurements, likely leading to this deflated {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}value. with this function in hand, we can extrapolate to higher multiplicity. for example, our model suggests that 32.3+/-2.7% of gk stars will harbor at least 8 planets within the kepler parameter space. in the parameter space of the kepler survey, our solar system has two mnras 000, 1-17 12 zink, christiansen, and hansen table 4. a representation of the expected empirical multiplicity as a function of selection e {latin small ligature ff}ects. each column shows the expected population using the best fit model from this study . starting from the left, moving right, each e {latin small ligature ff}ect is adding in addition to all previous e {latin small ligature ff}ects. the multiple detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency is broken into two columns. the data column directly used the multiplicity values shown in figure 6. in contrast, the model column uses the modified poisson distribution inferred from the multiplicity data . geometric mutual inclination single detection multiple detection multiple detection real kepler e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency data singles 1870 1910 1558 1649 +/- 71 1629 +/- 61 1637 doubles 686 816 397 374 +/- 29 375 +/- 33 346 triples 354 483 115 103 +/- 15 113 +/- 15 119 quadruples 207 282 30 26 +/- 6 25 +/- 6 43 quintuples 127 159 8 5 +/- 3 5 +/- 3 13 sextuples 132 77 1 1 +/- 1 1 +/- 1 2 septuples 167 28 0 0 +/- 1 0 +/- 1 1 planets . the radius of mercury is slightly smaller than our range allows. since we find {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}= 5.86 +/- 0.18 planets per solar-like star in this range, it appears that our system is more underpopulated than most other systems within p < 500 days. we would expect 30 +/- 1% systems harbor zero planets, 4.0 +/- 4.6% harbor just one planet, and 2.0+/-4.2% harbor only two planets within the range of this study. this lack of multiplicity in our solar system could be important for habitability, but such claims still lack strong evidence.",

        "Text": "analysis of the statistics of the kepler multiple planet systems suggest that the underlying planetary population requires a two component model. one component is composed of systems with high planet multiplicity and a low inclination dispersion, while the other requires either low intrinsic multiplicity or a large inclination dispersion to reduce the frequency of transits by multiple planets. this has been termed the kepler dichotomy. lissauer et al. inferred that the two populations had roughly equal frequencies and subsequent analyses confirmed this. there have been several models proposed to explain this on dynamical grounds . the simplest solution is to consider a single population of planets in which some fraction have experienced excitation of their mutual inclinations. however, to meet the requirements of the transit statistics, the excitation is su {latin small ligature ffi}ciently large that dynamical stability is hard to maintain . thus, the kepler results seem to imply the existence of a low multiplicity population of planetary systems, whether due to formation or later dynamical instability. however, this finding rests on the relative frequencies of systems with single transiting planets versus multiple transiting planets. if the completeness is a function of the detection order, this may weaken the claim for a kepler dichotomy. in figure 6 we show that a single poisson distribution can account for the multiplicity probabilities extracted from our analysis. we find a much smaller fraction of intrinsically single systems than fang & margot and find a distribution broadly similar to the model for a single, dynamically motivated population described in hansen & murray . however, we still find {tilde operator}6% of stars harbor intrinsically single or double planet systems. to test the robustness of this low multiplicity contribution we forward model the inferred population using the poisson multiplicity model. in table 4 under the label multiple detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency we present the multiplicity results of this model. we can see that almost all of the empirical population fall within 1 {greek small letter sigma} of the multiplicity model. this indicated that that apparent deviations in our infer fm values can be described by statistical fluctuations in population. additionally, our fm are very dependent on the choice of mixture values displayed in table 3. a proper accounting of these values would require distribution dependence. averaging over these parameters, as done here, can cause mild deviations in the inferred fm values. in extracting the population fm values, we have only employed a mild rayleigh distribution to account for mutual inclination of each system as directed by fang & margot and have no larger inclination component. it appears that accounting for systematic loss of planets at higher multiplicity substantially reduces the low multiplicity population inferred as per the kepler dichotomy. we shall now discuss how this works. using the forward model presented in section 8.1, we look at how the inclusion of detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency a {latin small ligature ff}ected the gap seen between systems with one transiting planet and those with two transiting planets. the population provided by the parameters in figure 8 is modeled 20 times and the median from each group is recorded in table 4. using our population parameters and a mild mutual inclination model show that this anomaly is largely due to kepler detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency. table 4 shows how the frequency of detected systems of di {latin small ligature ff}erent transit multiplicity changes as we include di {latin small ligature ff}erent systematic e {latin small ligature ff}ects. in the first column, we include only the correction of the probability of transit due to geometric alignment. for a simple numerical comparison, this results in a ratio of double transit to single transit systems of 0.37, to be compared to the observed value of 0.21 . the inclusion of a small mutual inclination dispersion, comparable to that of fang & margot , does not improve the ratio . in the third column, we show the model in which we include the completeness corrections from christiansen without the multiplicity treatment discussed here. this results in a partial improvement of the ratio to 0.25. it is also notable that the number of expected high transit multiplicity systems also drops significantly with the inclusion of this e {latin small ligature ff}ect. finally, in the fourth and fifth column, we show the expected numbers including the full, multiplicity-dependent completeness correction discussed here . we find that the expected number of di {latin small ligature ff}erent transit multiplicities are now very well matched to the observed numbers, substantially weakening the need for an additional population to explain the observations. the ultimate reason for this is that high transit multiplicity systems usually contain several planets that lie in the low mes region of parameter space, so that the incompleteness knocks planets down the multiplicity scale, resulting in many single transit systems that, in an ideal world, would show two or three transiting planets. furthermore, the improved stellar radius measurements from gaia suggests mnras 000, 1-17 transit multiplicity in planet occurrence rates 13 that many stars have larger radii than previously believed . increasing the stellar radius of system will decreases the probability of detection for an exoplanet. this correction will overall increase the inferred occurrence measurements. it is important to remember that our dataset does not include single hot jupiter planets as discussed in section 3. this observed population of 120 planets does not follow our power-law trend and appears to be uniquely single . while these outliers do provide some type of population dichotomy, their presence is not the most prominent cause of the excess of singles. our extracted population parameters f1 and f2 indicate that 4.0 +/- 4.6% of the underlying population does have only one planet, and that this contribution can be described by the modified poisson distribution used to fit the higher multiplicity systems. there is dynamical evidence that single transiting systems are more dynamically excited than multiple systems and this is consistent with the notion that some fraction of compact planetary systems are dynamically perturbed by the existence of giant planets on larger scales. previously, hansen found that explaining the original excess of single transits required a frequency of giant planets on large scales that was roughly double that found by radial velocity surveys. the reduction found here substantially alleviates that discrepancy. other recent work also supports the notion that single transiting systems are drawn from the same underlying planetary population as multiple harbor systems. weiss et al. find that both populations share essentially the same stellar and planetary properties, while zhu et al. use transit timing variations to infer that there is a strong correlation between multiplicity and dynamical excitation. they reject the notion that this is driven by giant planet excitation because they see no correlation with the metallicity of the host star, but such a correlation would be di {latin small ligature ffi}cult to see at the level of 4% as found here. this is further supported by munoz romero & kempton , who find no metallicity di {latin small ligature ff}erence between hosts of single and multiple transiting systems, but could easily accommodate mixtures at the 50% level.",

original modified gamma distribution is unique to hansen & murray . we map this model to a beta distribution , widely used among recent authors, for consistency. this model was inferred by simulating in situ gravitational assembly of planetary embryos and observing the resulting eccentricity population of the fully formed planets. although derived within a specific scenario, this distribution matches well with a model in which planets explore the full range of available phase space subject to the constraint of dynamical stability . as such, it represents a plausible description of the level of eccentricity to be expected in such systems. the average eccentricity of this population is {mathematical left angle bracket}e {mathematical right angle bracket}= 0.11. comparing these values to those of our base model, we find that eccentricity flattens the cdf of planet multiplicity, slightly decreasing {mathematical left angle bracket}npl {mathematical right angle bracket}to 5.69 +/-

underlying the beta distribution . the black line represents the empirical cdf of the detected single planet systems and the blue line represents the eccentricities of the detected multi-planet systems. we test the strength of this hypothesis. implementing only one true underlying eccentricity model, we inspect the detected eccentricity populations from both the single and multi-planet populations. when tested with the hansen & murray model , we find no significant di {latin small ligature ff}erence between the the observed eccentricities of multi-planet and single planet systems. this indicates that the di {latin small ligature ff}erences noted by van eylen et al. may be real. however, van eylen et al. suggests a beta distribution for single planet systems with {mathematical left angle bracket}e {mathematical right angle bracket}= 0.26. this is a significantly larger average eccentricity than expected by the hansen & murray model. when larger eccentricities are tested we do find observable differences between the single and multi-planet systems. the kipping model was calculated using radial velocity discoveries and contains a significant fraction of massive planets. this distribution is probably too eccentric for the tightly packed model discussed here, but illustrates the effects of detection bias on the eccentricity population. in figure 7 we present the results of our test on the kipping model. we find that multi-planet systems tend to produce more low eccentricity detections than single planet detections despite being drawn from the same underlying population. analyzing the statistical difference with an anderson-darling test produces a p-value of 10-7, suggesting these di {latin small ligature ff}erences would appear statistically significant. furthermore, we can see that neither of the detected populations closely mimic the true beta distribution, highlighting the importance of detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency consideration when performing eccentricity occurrence measurements. this e {latin small ligature ff}ect is caused by the increased transit duration for higher eccentricity transits. increasing the transit duration improves the planet mes, making the signal easier to detect. since the highest mes planets are the most likely to be detected, this biases the empirical population toward higher eccentricity. the sorting order in combination with the multiplicity detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency of the kepler pipeline will further exaggerate this bias in the single planet systems. mnras 000, 1-17

{mathematical left angle bracket}e {mathematical right angle bracket} {greater-than or slanted equal to}0.18 will produce statistically significant di {latin small ligature ff}erences between the empirical eccentricity population of singles and multiple planet systems. since van eylen et al. suggests a {mathematical left angle bracket}e {mathematical right angle bracket}= 0.26 model for the singles and a {mathematical left angle bracket}e {mathematical right angle bracket}= 0.05 model for the multi-planet systems, it is di {latin small ligature ffi}cult to determine the e {latin small ligature ff}ect of detection bias on their eccentricity model. at this point we cannot rule out that two distinct populations of eccentricity exist between the single and multi-planet systems, but propose that such claims require further evidence.",

    "Text": "we present a new method for determining the frequency of exoplanet multiplicity within the kepler dataset. in doing so we provide the following new fitting features and conclusions: 1. previous studies have discussed and provided methods for calculating high multiplicity transit probabilities ; brakensiek & ragozzine ; read et al. ). for occurrence calculations these procedures are often too complex and computationally expensive to carry out. we provide a new method which marginalizes over mutual inclination and the empirical kepler period set to determine the transit probabilities for kepler multi-planet systems. using this, we provide the transit probabilities for multiple systems containing up to 7 planets. this simplification is important and useful when trying to fit multiplicity parameters via mcmc or some other fitting method that requires 104 calculations. our method does make some simplification assumptions in the interests of speed. we assume the measurements of planet radius and period are perfect. the uncertainty in period is negligible, however the radius measurements retain significant uncertainty and the present dispersion may yet mask finer features in the distribution. in accounting for mutual inclination, we adopt the model provided by fang & margot . this is derived using a di {latin small ligature ff}erent multiplicity model than that found here. all orbits are assumed to be circular in our base model. because many of the systems are very compact, circular orbits are required for any type of stability. tidal circularization will also force many of these planets into circular orbits. however, it is possible that some portion of the population, investigated here, contains varying amounts of eccentricity. we show that any amount of eccentricity will increases our the overall multiplicity values, but decreases the fraction of systems with planets. we have assumed the appropriate model for exoplanet occurrence is a broken power-law. furthermore, we assume period and radius and uncorrelated. it has been shown by owen & wu and weiss et al. that a mild correlation exist between period and radius at short periods where photoevaporation can take e {latin small ligature ff}ect. nevertheless, the fact that our forward modeling matches the data inspires confidence that the model provides a coherent description of the data. 2. in systems with more than one detected planet, we find that detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency decreases for higher detection order planets. this conclusion was achieved by re-visiting the christiansen injections and looking at systems with pre-existing planets. multiple planets systems experience an additional loss, for lower mes planets within each system, of at least 5.5% and 15.9% for periods < 200 days and > 200 days respectively. this type of increased selection e {latin small ligature ff}ects indicates that a larger fraction of the population is being missed. being able to infer a larger population of multiple exoplanet systems significantly decreases the gap between single and double planet systems. the initial motivation for additional detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciencies for multi-planet systems, was the 61 known kois lost during the christiansen injections. when testing our additional selection e {latin small ligature ff}ects, for multiples, we expect 41 +/- 7 planets should be lost due to a similar type of injection test. because we find that 61 kois are lost we suspect higher order detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciencies may be necessary for an accurate accounting of the true underlying populations. 3. using bayesian statistics, we expand the poisson process likelihood to account for variations in detection order. furthermore, we are able to infer population multiplicity from this fitting process. the results from this fit match that of burke et al. , but provide an improved measurement with reduced uncertainty from gaia, cks, and asteroseismology . furthermore, by looking at the occurrence of single and double-planet systems, we only find a 0.9 {greek small letter sigma} di {latin small ligature ff}erence between these two populations . this disparity can be explained by a modified poisson distribution with {greek small letter lamda} = 8.40 +/- 0.31 and {greek small letter kappa} = 0.70 +/- 0.01, indicating that the kepler dichotomy ; fang & margot ; hansen & murray ; ballard & johnson ) may largely be an artifact of detection e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency and statistical fluctuation. using a poisson process likelihood requires that each planet is drawn independently, which is clearly not the case for planets mnras 000, 1-17 transit multiplicity in planet occurrence rates 15 in multiple systems. much of the work in this study is accounting for these dependencies. ignoring the independence requirement of poisson process could be suspect, but is again justified by the success of our forward model, where this assumption is not necessary. the independence of radius between planets within a system has also not been accounted for within this study. 4. given our inferred multiplicity model we can extrapolate to higher multi-planet systems. we find that 32.3 +/- 2.7% of solar-like stars should contain at least 8 planets within 500 days. the existence of a single 7 planet system and a single 8 planet system indicates these systems should be rare but still detectable. we would expect to find < 1 eight planet systems within the constraints of this study. 5. we introduce and demonstrate that forward modeling a broken power-law distribution can still provide a reasonable model for the exoplanet population, despite growing evidence for a gap in 1.5 -2r {circled plus}range . we find that our fitting model also produces similar populations of multiplicity to that of the empirical kepler data set, indicating the success of this method. 6. using the the eccentricity model of hansen & murray , we show that eccentricity can a {latin small ligature ff}ect the multiplicity occurrence by slightly decreasing the expected number of planets around each star. we also find that for eccentricity models with {mathematical left angle bracket}e {mathematical right angle bracket} {greater-than or slanted equal to}0.18 the kepler pipeline will significantly skew the empirical population of eccentricity for single transiting systems, suggesting that di {latin small ligature ff}erences seen between the single and multiple planet systems may be artificial.",

    "Text": "in this section, we will prove that sn has normalized flow property which implies that sn is indeed sperner. theorem 3.1. sn has normalized flow property. 4 larry h. harper and gene b. kim proof. we proceed by induction on n. the base case is trivial. as for the inductive step, let us assume that sn has normalized flow property. the rank-weights of sn, |sn,k| = sn,k, the stirling numbers of the first kind, satisfy the recurrence relation sn+1,k = nsn,k + sn,k-1. before continuing with the proof, we give an example of using this recurrence relation to view s4 as four copies of s3: figure 1. viewing s4 as four copies of s3 the copies of s3 are arranged in a way that the first copy of s3 has the six permutations {greek small letter pi} with {greek small letter pi} = 4, the second copy has {greek small letter pi} with {greek small letter pi} = 4, the third copy has {greek small letter pi} with {greek small letter pi} = 4, and the fourth raised copy has {greek small letter pi} with {greek small letter pi} = 4. the red edges connect permutations from the raised copy to permutations of other copies, and the gray, dashed edges connect permutations from the lower copies to other lower copies. a direct combinatorial proof of the recurrence follows from the observation that for {greek small letter pi} belong to sn+1,k, there are two possibilities: in the case that {greek small letter pi} = n + 1, we can remove n + 1 from {greek small letter pi} and have {greek small letter pi} {prime} belong to sn,k-1. conversely, adding a 1-cycle with n + 1 to {greek small letter pi} {prime} belong to sn,k-1 will give {greek small letter pi} belong to sn+1,k. in the case that {greek small letter pi} = i, where 1 {less-than or equal to}i {less-than or equal to}n, we can remove n + 1 from the cycle containing {greek small letter pi} = i and define {greek small letter pi} {prime}) = i, which will is the symmetric group sperner? 5 give n copies, s n,k for 1 {less-than or equal to}i {less-than or equal to}n. conversely, the operation of defining {greek small letter pi} belong to sn+1,k from {greek small letter pi} {prime} belong to sn,k can be done similarly. there is exactly one map {greek small letter pi} 7 {rightwards arrow} {greek small letter pi} {prime} between the copy labeled i and n + 1, by construction, and the figure below is provided to help the reader visualize. . . . 1 2 n n + 1 k k + 1 figure 2. viewing sn+1 in light of the recurrence relation by the inductive hypothesis and the regularity between the n blue copies of sn, we can collapse the n copies as in the figure below, where the collapsed copy is in bold. n + 1 k k + 1 figure 3. collapsing the n copies of sn we claim that this new network satisfies the normalized matching condition. to show this, we consider the two consecutive ranks k and k +1, which are shown with the corresponding vertex-weights: 6 larry h. harper and gene b. kim nsn,k+1 nsn,k sn,k sn,k-1 figure 4. two consecutive ranks k and k + 1 the only non-trivial equivalence class to show the normalized matching condition for is the class with the lower, right vertex. in other words, we need to show that sn,k-1 sn,k-1 + nsn,k {less-than or equal to} sn,k sn,k + nsn,k+1 . this is equivalent to sn,k-1sn,k+1 {less-than or equal to}s2 n,k, which is true due to the 2-positivity of sn,k's, which was proved in . hence, nmc is satisfied, which in turn implies that sn satifies nmc, and so, has normalized flow property. {white square} remark. the lattice in figure 3 is 1 n sn * which has nfp by the product theorem . our proof actually shows that 1 * 1 2 * 1 2 3 * {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} * 1 2 {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} n -1 n {subset of or equal to}sn. since the former has nfp by the product theorem, the latter has nfp also. now that we have shown that sn has normalized flow property, we want to find a network we can map sn to, via a flow morphism, which is sperner. in fact, we can collapse the network in figure 3 further, just by keeping the same rank: n + 1 k k + 1 figure 5. collapsing the n copies of sn is the symmetric group sperner? 7 since the resulting network is a totally ordered set, the largest antichain is going to be the rank/vertex, say v, with the largest vertex weight. the composition of the collapsings is a flow morphism, and so, the preimage of v in sn will be the largest antichain. by construction, the preimage of each vertex in the totally ordered network is a rank in sn, and so, the largest antichain in sn is the largest rank. thus, sn is indeed sperner.",

    "Text": "it has been shown that the consistency of an electrodynamics theory under the duality transformation can be expressed as a requirement in which the lagrangian must transform under duality in a particular way, defined by the noether-gaillard-zumino identity . so, in general, a nonlinear electrodynamics theory that saturates the ngz identity, is a self-dual theory. one of the familiar self-dual electrodynamics theory is the born-infeld theory lbi = q -det -1, where fab = {partial differential}aab - {partial differential}baa is gauge field strength and a is polarization of the gauge field. this theory could be enjoyed the sl s-duality after taking axion and dilaton fields into account. this action is not invariant under the s-duality, however, its equations of motion and energy-momentum tensor are invariant under the s-duality as it was shown for the electric-magnetic duality. the supersymmetric p-branes that supported by ramond-ramond sources are the solutions of type ii superstring theories. these branes have alternative description in terms of open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions. d-branes are described by an e {latin small ligature ff}ective dirac-born-infeld action which is closely connected to the born-infeld type e {latin small ligature ff}ective action of open string theory. we consider the d3-brane of type iib theory which play a special role in this theory. the action corresponding to this brane in the einstein frame can be interpreted as a generalization of four dimensional bi action coupled to a special background metric, dilaton, axion, etc . sd3 = -td3 z d4x q -det + td3 z , where all the bulk fields in the action are pull-back onto the world-volume of d-brane. it has been demonstrated that the d3-brane action and the corresponding equation of motion and energy-momentum tensor are invariant under the sl symmetry of type iib theory2 . in fact, this action satisfies the ngz identity. as was pointed out in that the duality invariance of hamiltonian and thus of the corresponding energy momentum tensor should imply the invariance of the s-matrix. 1from the presence of two two-form gauge fields b2 and c2 in the string theory, a string can carry two types of charge. these two-forms form a doublet of sl it follows that the string also transform as a doublet. on the other hand, the transformation of the complex field {greek small letter tau} = c0 + ie {greek small letter phi}0 {rightwards arrow}-1/ {greek small letter tau} evaluated at c0 = 0, changes the sign of the dilaton, which implies that the string coupling constant maps to its inverse . 2this symmetry is not shared by the full type iib superstring theory. indeed, it is broken by a variety of stringy and quantum e {latin small ligature ff}ects to the infinite discrete subgroup sl. 1 it is known that the s-matrix elements satisfy the ward identity corresponding to the s-duality. at the level of the equations of motion, d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action is invariant under nonlinear s-duality transformation . so at higher orders, one dose not expect the e {latin small ligature ff}ective action to be consistent with the nonlinear s-duality. it was pointed in that the bi action involving on-shell gauge field is invariant under the linear s-duality up to f 4 terms. from this point, the disk-level scattering amplitude of four gauge fields on the world volume of a single d3-brane, which appears as a contact term, should be invariant under the linear s-duality. the leading order s-matrix element of the six gauge fields has both contact terms coming from the f 6 terms in the bi action and massless poles coming from the f 4 terms in the bi action. so as expected, no part of this amplitude is not invariant under the linear sl transformation separately, however, the combination of these two parts is invariant. it has been discussed in that by imposing the linear s-duality transformation on the s-dual invariant amplitude of four gage fields, the pole part of the amplitude of six gage fields could be constructed. then, f 6contact-terms could be found by applying the linear s-duality again. then using the linear s-duality, one may find the contact terms of f 8, and so on. this result confirms the bi action with abelian gage fields as the e {latin small ligature ff}ective action of a single d-brane. so, in order to investigate the behavior of s-matrix elements under duality transformation, it is convenient to separate the {greek small letter alpha} {prime} expansion of them into two parts: contact term and massless n-poles a = acontact + x n an-poles. neither acontact nor an-poles are invariant under the linear s-duality. in fact, the combination of these two parts, {latin small letter dotless i}.e. a, must be invariant. on the other hand, the pole part of amplitude may transform to contact part under the linear s-duality transformation, so the e {latin small ligature ff}ective action, that is made of contact part, satisfies the ward identity corresponding to s-duality3. in the case that the s-matrix elements have no massless poles, one can find the corresponding couplings from the consistency of them with the dualities. unlike the gauge field transformation that is carried by its field strength, all other transformations are done by field potential. so, the pole part of s-matrix dose not transform to contact part under the closed string sl transformation. it could be noted that if the s-matrix involves the antisymmetric nsns closed string, it could be found the amplitude in terms of b-field strength h by combining the pole part in amplitude which are produced by the gauge fields and some of the contact terms which are produced by replacement f {rightwards arrow}f + b . the s-matrix elements of one rr two-form field and three gauge fields that appears as a pole term and the s-matrix elements of one b field and three gauge fields that contains a 3on the other hand, the t-duality transformation dose not transform the pole terms to contact terms, so the contact terms always satisfy the ward identity corresponding to t-duality . 2 contact term as well as a pole term have been calculated in . it has been shown that the combination of these two amplitudes could be appeared in terms of a sl invariant structure. in this paper we show that these amplitudes transform to each other under the linear s-duality transformation a1-pole {rightwards arrow}acontact + a1-pole. inspired by the above observation that the s-matrix elements of one closed string and three open strings should satisfy the ward identity corresponding to the s-duality, it could be proposed the following expression for the massless n-pole amplitude of n rr two-form. an-polen, f 4-n) {rightwards arrow}acontact + a1-pole + {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} + an-pole where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. the contact part of above amplitude could be exactly reproduced by the replacement f {rightwards arrow}f + b in the d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action. it is convenient to consider the normalization factor 2 {greek small letter pi} {greek small letter alpha} {prime} in front of the gauge field in dbi action. with this normalization, the dbi action is at the leading order of {greek small letter alpha} {prime}. the {greek small letter alpha} {prime} corrections to born-infeld action have been studied in in the {greek small letter sigma}-model approach. the derivatives of gauge fields could be appeared in d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action. the study of the behavior of four point function under the linear s-duality could be extended to four point function with derivative corrections. it has been shown in that the electromagnetic self-duality holds for such functions with derivative corrections at the order of {greek small letter alpha} {prime}2. so, one might expect that the sl s-dual invariant structure could be appeared for each order of {greek small letter alpha} {prime} independently. on other words, we have to answer the following question that should s-duality be a symmetry of full d3-brane action with all derivative corrections? there is no exact reasoning for this, but there is still an alternative logic suggesting that d3-brane action should be s-duality covariant4 . by calculating the scattering amplitude of four open string in iib superstring theory, it has been found that the leading order of d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action in superstring theory contains four gauge fields and four derivatives l4 = e-2 {greek small letter phi} x121 4 {partial differential}cf ef {partial differential}cf ab {partial differential}dfef {partial differential}dfab -1 2 {partial differential}cfd f

self-duality. we will find the form of above action that is manifestly s-dual. in fact, we will find the above action in terms a nonlinear s-dual structure. from the nonlinear expansion of the 4we would like to thank a.a.tseytlin for discussions on this point. 3 sl invariant structures, we find this e {latin small ligature ff}ective action up to level of n gauge fields and four derivatives. the outline of the paper is as follows: we begin in section 2 by studying the s-duality transformations of bosonic fields and find some sl invariant structures involving these fields. in section 3, we show that the compatibility of the s-matrix elements of one gauge field, two scalar fields and one rr field c with the s-duality generates the s-matrix elements of one gauge field, two scalar fields and one nsns b-field. we find a s-dual invariant form of these amplitudes and then predict the axion amplitude. in section 4, we calculate the s-matrix elements of three gauge fields and one nsns b-field by applying the s-duality transformation on the s-matrix elements of three gauge fields and one rr field c. in section 5, using sl invariant structures found in section 2, we write the d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action involving four gauge fields and four derivatives in s-dual form. this expression could be extended to include more gauge fields. 2 nonlinear sl structure the axion c0 combines with the dilaton {greek small letter phi}0 to give the complex scalar field {greek small letter tau} = c0 + ie- {greek small letter phi}0. now consider the matrix m m = e {greek small letter phi}0 x12 | {greek small letter tau}|2 c0 c0 1 x13 . the nonlinear sl transformation of the complex scalar field and the above matrix are given by {greek small letter tau} {rightwards arrow}p {greek small letter tau} + q r {greek small letter tau} + s , m {rightwards arrow} {greek capital letter lamda}m {greek capital letter lamda}t ; {greek capital letter lamda} = p q r s ! belong to sl. for the gauge field we have the following transformation fab {rightwards arrow} sfab + r {small tilde} gab, gab {rightwards arrow} pgab -q {small tilde} fab, where fab = -1 2 {latin small letter o with ogonek}abcd {small tilde} f cd, the antisymmetric tensor gab is given by -2 {partial differential}l/ {partial differential}f ab and l is the lagrangian. by considering a gauge field doublet fab containing fab and gab and also a background field doublet bab containing the two forms b and c and using {small tilde} = -f, one can write the transformation of these field doublets as fab {rightwards arrow}tfab ; bab {rightwards arrow}tbab. using the above transformations, one can find that the structures f tmf and btmb are sl invariant structures. 4 consider lagrangian in terms of two possible lorentz invariants t = 1/4f abfab and z = 1/4f ab {small tilde} fab. at the presence of axion and dilaton couplings, it could be useful to express the lagrangian in the following form which the contribution of axion coupling is separated. l = l {prime} + c0z the antisymmetric tensor gab then separates as gab = g {prime} ab -c0 {small tilde} fab where g {prime} ab could be an arbitrary nonlinear function of f which is g {prime} ab = -2 {partial differential}l {prime} {partial differential}f ab. by this consideration one gets the sl invariant structure in the following form: a cm0fbc = e- {greek small letter phi}0 {small tilde} fa c {small tilde} fbc + e {greek small letter phi}0 g {prime} a c g {prime} bc, where the matrix m0 is the matrix m in which the dilaton and the r-r scalar are constant . it is easy to check that the above structure is invariant under the linear transformations g {prime} {rightwards arrow} {small tilde} f , {small tilde} f {rightwards arrow}-g {prime} and e- {greek small letter phi}0 {rightwards arrow}e {greek small letter phi}0. when the dilaton and the r-r scalar are constant, one finds the following s-dual multiplet: a cm0bbc = e- {greek small letter phi}0fa cbbc - {small tilde} fa cc bc -c0 {small tilde} fa cbbc. at the presence of two gauge fields with two derivatives, one can find the following sl invariant structure {partial differential}f t m {partial differential}f = e- {greek small letter phi}0 {partial differential} {small tilde} f {partial differential} {small tilde} f + e {greek small letter phi}0 {partial differential}g {prime} {partial differential}g {prime}. by considering the nonlinear expansion of g {prime} ab as g {prime} ab = e- {greek small letter phi}0f + e-2 {greek small letter phi}0f 3 + {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} + e-n {greek small letter phi}0f 2n-1, the nonlinear sl invariant structure corresponding to 2n gauge fields and two derivatives could be found. {partial

differential}f + {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} . 3 s-dual amplitude of one gauge field, two scalar fields and one two-form the s-matrix elements of one gauge field, two scalar fields and one two-form vertex operator could be calculated from d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action. at first, we are going to find the corresponding amplitude in which the two-form is an antisymmetric rr field c. the amplitude is given by the following feynman rule: a 1 , f2, {greek capital letter phi}3, {greek capital letter phi}4) = v a 1 , a)gabv b, 5 where f2 is the polarization of the gauge boson, {greek capital letter phi}3, {greek capital letter phi}4 are the scalar fields and a is the o {latin small ligature ff}-shell gauge field propagating between the two vertices. the gauge boson propagator and the vertices can be read from d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action gab {tilde operator} -e {greek small letter phi}0 {greek small letter eta}ab k {middle dot}k v a 1 , a) {tilde operator} -k {middle dot})a v b {tilde operator} e- {greek small letter phi}0 {greek capital letter phi}3i {greek capital letter phi}4 i x14 k {middle dot}k3k4 {middle dot}f a 2 + k {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k4ka 3 -1 2k3 {middle dot}k4k {middle dot}f a 2 x15 + where )ab = 1 2 {latin small letter o with ogonek}abcd)cd. from the conservation of momentum along the brane we have k = -k1 = k2 + k3 + k4. considering the above vertices and propagator, one finds that the s-matrix elements have not any contribution to the contact amplitude and the amplitude then appears as a pole amplitude: a 1 , f2, {greek capital letter phi}3, {greek capital letter phi}4) = {greek capital letter phi}3i {greek capital letter phi}i 4 k1 {middle dot}k1 x14 k1 {middle dot} {small tilde} c 1 {middle dot}k4 k1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k3 -k1 {middle dot}k3 k1 {middle dot} {small tilde} c 1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k4 +1 2k3 {middle dot}k4 k1 {middle dot} {small tilde} c 1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k1 x15 + . the amplitude dose not satisfy the ward identity corresponding to the s-duality transformations, however is invariant under the ward identity corresponding to abelian gauge symmetry and to the rr gauge symmetry. the amplitude corresponding to antisymmetric b-field has massless pole as well as contact term. the contact part of b-field amplitude can be found using the feynman rule and considering the relevant higher derivative correction of d-brane action. acontact = e- {greek small letter phi}0 {greek capital letter phi}3i {greek capital letter phi}i 4 x141 4k3 {middle dot}k4tr -k3 {middle dot}b1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k4 x15 + . considering the propagator and vertex v b in and using the fourth order in the expansion of d-brane action to find the vertex operator v a = e- {greek small letter phi}0k1 {middle dot}ba 1, one finds the pole part of b-field amplitude as following: apole = v agabv b = -e- {greek capital letter phi} {greek capital letter phi}3i {greek capital letter phi}i 4 k1.k1 x14 k1 {middle dot}b1 {middle dot}k4k1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k3 -k1 {middle dot}k3k1 {middle dot}b1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k4 +1 2k3 {middle dot}k4k1 {middle dot}b1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}k1 x15 + where we use the previously mentioned conservation of momentum. now, we are going to determine the transformation behavior of the amplitude under the s-duality transformation when the axion background dos not tack into account c0 = 0. 6 there are two di {latin small ligature ff}erent structures in amplitude that transform under the s-duality as following: kn {middle dot} {small tilde} c 1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}km {rightwards arrow} e- {greek small letter phi}kn {middle dot} {small tilde} b1 {middle dot} {small tilde} f2 {middle dot}km = e- {greek small letter phi} x12 kn {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}b1 {middle dot}km -1 2kn {middle dot}kmtr x13 , kn {middle dot} {small tilde} c 1 {middle dot}km kp {middle dot}f2

{middle dot}kqkp {middle dot}kmtr + 1 2kn {middle dot}kpkq {middle dot}kmtr -kn {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}kmkp {middle dot}b1 {middle dot}kq -kq {middle dot}kmkn {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}b1 {middle

dot}kq x13 , where we use the following identity: {latin small letter o with ogonek}abcd {latin small letter o with ogonek}efgh = x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c {greek small letter eta}ae {greek small letter eta}af {greek small letter eta}ag {greek small letter eta}ah {greek small letter eta}be {greek small letter eta}bf {greek small letter eta}bg {greek small letter eta}bh {greek small

eta}dh x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c x0c . applying the above relations in the amplitude , one obtains the amplitudes and . in fact the amplitude of one rr, two scalar and one gauge field transform to the amplitude of one nsns b-field, two scalar and one gauge field under the s-duality. a x10 c 1 , f2, {greek capital letter phi}3, {greek capital letter phi}4 x11 {rightwards arrow} acontact + apole . therefore, to get the nsns coupling to brane, one can apply the s-duality on the pole amplitude contains rr state. this is consistent with the statement that the nsns coupling is found by replacement f {rightwards arrow}f + b in the d-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action that has been expressed in literatures. at the presence of the axion field, it is expected that one can find the combination of the amplitudes , and in terms of sl invariant structures. to do this, we consider all contraction of the sl invariant structure {small tilde} f tmb with four, two and zero momenta as following: abmbcd m k1ak2bk3ck4d = e- {greek small letter phi}k1 {middle dot}fn {middle dot}k2k4 {middle dot}bm {middle dot}k3 + c0e- {greek small letter phi}k1 {middle dot}fn {middle

dot}k4tr -k3 {middle dot} {small tilde} cm {middle dot}fn {middle dot}k4, tr = -e- {greek small letter phi}tr -c0e- {greek small letter phi}tr + tr. 7 considering the above relations, one can find the following combination of above sl invariant structures contains the amplitude as well as the amplitude + . e a = - {greek capital letter phi}3i {greek capital letter phi}i 4 k1 {middle dot}k1 x141 2k3

that this sl invariant amplitude transformation) also contains the amplitude a . in fact, to make a sl invariant amplitude from amplitudes and + , the amplitude corresponding to axion field should be take into account. on the other hand, we can confirm the above sl invariant amplitude by deriving the axion amplitude from the explicit calculation and the feynman rule that is resulted as following pole amplitude: a = -c0e- {greek small letter phi} {greek capital letter phi}3i {greek capital letter phi}i 4 k1 {middle dot}k1 x14 k1 {middle dot} {small tilde} b1 {middle dot}k4k1 {middle dot}f2

exactly equal to the axion amplitude that lies in . 4 s-dual amplitude of three gauge fields and one twoform it has been shown that the amplitude of three gauge fields and one two-form in which the two-form is rr field c or nsns b-field could be appeared in terms of sl invariant structures in the presence of the background dilaton and r-r scalar fields . we are going to show that these two amplitudes transform to each other under the s-duality transformation when the axion field dose not tack into account. we strart with the amplitude of three gage fields and one rr field c that is founded by explicit calculation. a x10 c1 , f2, f3, f4 x11 = 1 4e- {greek small letter phi}0 k1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot} {small tilde} c 1 {middle dot}k1 k1 {middle dot}k1 tr -e- {greek small

contains two independent structures. we apply s-duality transformation to these two structures separately. e- {greek small letter phi}0k1 {middle dot}f2 {middle dot}f3 {middle dot}f4 {middle dot}

ijbnmk1 e = j234. because the invariance of the trace term in the original amplitude under the gauge fields permutations, one can easily conclude j234 = j243, j423 = j432 and j324 = j342 in the dual amplitude. therefore, the gauge field permutations can produce six di {latin small ligature ff}erent terms of i-type and three di {latin small ligature ff}erent terms of j-type that contribute in the dual amplitude. the calculation in this case is more complicated than the case in the previous section due to the presence of four levi-civita tensors. to rewrite this terms in terms of various contractions of gauge fields, one has to use the identity . here, one encounters with di {latin small ligature ff}erent choices. in fact, there are three ways to pairs the levi-civita tensors: e = , e {prime} = and e {prime} {prime} = . using the standard identity for the above first two parings in i-type terms, we have: inmp = e-2 {greek small letter phi}0 x14 -k1 {middle dot}fn {middle dot}b

m, p = 2, 3, 4 and n {combining long solidus overlay}= m {combining long solidus overlay}= p. our calculations show that one can get to the amplitude of a x10 b1 , f2, f3, f4 x11 only by selecting the specific parings of levi-civita tensors as following: a x10 c1 , f2, f3, f4 x11 s {rightwards arrow}i234 + i324 + i423 + i243 + i342 + i432 k1 {middle dot}k1 -1 2 j234 + j324 + j423 k1 {middle dot}k1 . replacing and in the above relation and using the conservation of momentum, one finds the following expression, after a straightforward calculation. 1 2e-2 {greek small letter phi}0 x12 tr -1 4trtr

calculated in . 5 s-dual e {latin small ligature ff}ective action with four derivative corrections it has been shown that the one-loop correction to the d3-brane abelian born-infeld action containing four gauge fields with four derivative proportional to f 4 where s, t and u are the mandelstam variables . this result has been found from supersymmetry fixing and string disk-level scattering amplitude calculation. the d3-brane e {latin small ligature ff}ective action at the order of 4 is invariant under the sl duality. from the lagrangian viewpoint, this action saturates the ngz identity. we are going to find this action in terms of some sl invariant structures. to do this, one should consider all contractions of two nonlinear structures w abcdefgwghnmpq, which any of them contains two gauge field derivative terms as following w abcdef = {partial differential}a bcm {partial differential}df ef. using xact , one finds the following 33 di {latin small ligature ff}erent ww contractions:

structure at the level of four gauge fields and four derivatives, one finds that the ww structures appear in terms of the gauge field contents 4, 22 and 4. in order to make the action in terms of the above ww structures, we should find the contribution of dual gauge field {small tilde} f in the last two field contents in terms of gauge field f by using the identity . for the third field content, we encounter with four levi-civita tensors and with di {latin small ligature ff}erent choices to pair these tensors 10 as was mentioned in the previous section: e, e {prime} and e {prime} {prime}. any of these parings of levicivita tensors led to di {latin small ligature ff}erent results in which the gauge fields appear in di {latin small ligature ff}erent kinds of contraction terms 4. but one can show that these results are equal when the identities presenting in the appendix have been tack into account. after finding the above ww structures in terms of gauge field contraction terms 4 and using the identities in the appendix properly, we find the following 9 equations between the constants: w15 = -3 2 + 2 -3 + w22 + w8, w13 = 2 3 + 1 3, w21 = 2 3 + 1 2 + 1 6w15 -7 6w8 + w16 + w2, w26 = -1 3 + 2 3 + 8 3 + 6 +w14 -w16 + w19 + w27 -w7, w28 = 4 3 + 1 3 + 4 + w27 -w7, w3 = 4 3 + 1 3 -w29 + w30 + w6, w4 = w17 -w24 -w29 + w30 + w6, w5 = 2 3 + 1 2 + 1 6 -2w1 -w18 + w2 w9 = 1 6. the nonzero coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients could be fixed as follows by comparing the result with the action : w3 = w4 = w5 = w6 = 1 2, w7 = -3 2, w27 = 3 2, w28 = 1. by substituting these nonzero coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients in , we can find the sl invariant form of the action . ls 4 = 1 2wbef cabwdc fe a d + 1 2wa ab cb cwd de fe f + 1 2wbc fcabwdef e a d + 1 2wcd f cabweb fe a d -3 2wa

field g {prime} up to the level of three gauge field f 3. so the 11 expansion of {partial differential}g {prime} up to this level, could be found as follows: {partial differential}ag {prime} bc = e- {greek small letter phi}0 {partial differential}afbc + e-2 {greek small letter phi}0 x121 4fdef de {partial differential}afbc + fc dfd e {partial differential}afbe -fb dfd e {partial differential}afce -fb dfc e {partial differential}afde + 1 2fbcf de {partial differential}afde x13 + {middle dot} {middle dot} {middle dot} where dots refer to the terms at higher order of gauge field. inserting the above expansion into the nonzero invariant structurs ww in , one can find the action containing six gauge fields with four derivatives that is compatible with s-duality. this action could be appear in the simple form when one consider the total derivative terms. actualy, at the level of six gauge fields and four derivatives, there are 584 contractions with structure ffdfdfdfdf. to find the total derivative terms, we note that there are 724 total derivative terms with structure d. using their coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients to eliminate the terms with structure fffddfdfdf, one finds 483 constraint equations. applying these constraints, the total derivative terms with structure ffdfdfdfdf could be found. considering these terms and using the the on-shell condition {partial differential}af ab = 0 , one can find the action corresponding to six gauge fields with four derivatives as following simple form. ls f 24 {tilde operator} 3 2f abf cd {partial differential}cfe f

invariant structures in the final s-dual form of the action , one can derive new couplings at the order of n gauge fields with four derivatives by expanding the invariant structures. we see that the consistency of the action with the s-duality predicts the couplings and the couplings at the level of more gauge fields in the einstein frame. it would be interesting to confirm these couplings by direct calculations5. 5the s-matrix elements may be constrained by both manifest lorentz and duality invariance. considering the duality invariance, as we did in this paper, may be interpreted as an intermediate step towards an analysis of the scattering amplitude . 13 acknowledgments: the authors would like to kindly thank m.r.garousi and a.a.tseytlin for useful comments and discussions on related topics. apendix in this appendix we are going to find all identities that should be taken in to account when one wants to write the action in terms of sl invariant structures ww. in fact, the terms containing four dual gauge fields and four derivatives should be written in terms of four gauge fields and four derivatives. let us begin with the simple case, where we have four dual gauge fields with zero derivative. there are two di {latin small ligature ff}erent contracted forms for these fields as {small tilde} fac {small tilde} f ab {small tilde} fbd {small tilde} fcd and {small

applied mathematics january 3, 2019 arxiv:1901.00201v1 1 jan 2019 di {latin small ligature ff}erent numerical techniques, such as finite di {latin small ligature ff}erence, finite volume methods, can be used to approximate problems with fractional power elliptic operators. in this paper we will use the method of finite elements, since this method is well-suited to solve problems in non-regular domains and to use non-uniform adaptive grids . the implementation of such algorithms require to compute the action of a matrix function on a vector {greek capital letter phi}b, where a is a given matrix and b is a given vector. for example, in order to compute the solution of the discrete fractional order elliptic problem, we get {greek capital letter phi} = z- {greek small letter alpha}, where 0 < {greek small letter alpha} < 1. there exist various approaches how to compute {greek capital letter phi}b . the most important class of iterative methods for this purpose are krylov subspace methods. they are used to solve systems of linear equations obtained after approximation of fractional power elliptic problems . a comparison of di {latin small ligature ff}erent approaches to solve fractional-in-space reaction-di {latin small ligature ff}usion equations is done in . in particular the integral and adaptively preconditioned lanczos method are analyzed. the most straightforward algorithm to solve such systems is to construct explicitly eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the given discrete elliptic operator and to diagonalize the matrix a . but we should note that the direct implementation of this approach is very expensive for general elliptic operators in multidimensional domains. it requires the computation of all eigenvectors and eigenvalues of very large matrices. a general approach to solve fractional power elliptic problems is based on some approximation of the nonlocal operator. one can adopt a general approach to solve numerically equations involving fractional power of operators by a popular method is to split the task to solve numerically equations involving fractional power into two steps. first the original elliptic operator is approximated and then the fractional power of its discrete variant is taken. using dunford-cauchy formula the elliptic operator is represented as a contour integral in the complex plane. then applying appropriate quadratures with integration nodes in the complex plane we get a method that involves only inversion of the original elliptic operator. the approximate operator is treated as a sum of resolvents , ensuring the exponential convergence of quadrature approximations. in paper a more promising quadratures algorithm is proposed, when the integration nodes are selected in the real axis. the new method is based on the integral representation of the power operator . in this case the inverse operator of the fractional power elliptic problem is treated as a sum of inverse operators of elliptic operators. such a rational approximation is obtained when the fractional power of the operator is approximated by using the gauss-jacobi quadrature formulas for the corresponding integral representation. in this case, we have a pade-type approximation of the power function with a fractional exponent. the optimal rational approximations are investigated in . a separate class of methods approximates the solution of fractional power elliptic problem by some auxiliary problem of high dimension. in it is shown that the solution of the fractional laplacian problem can be obtained 2 as a solution of the elliptic problem on the semi-infinite cylinder domain. this idea is used to construct numerical algorithms for solving stationary and nonstationary problems with fractional power elliptic operators . in , for solving fractional power elliptic problems we have proposed a numerical algorithm on the basis of a transition to a pseudo-parabolic equation, so called cauchy problem method. the computational algorithm is simple for practical use, robust, and applicable to solving a wide class of problems. we have used this algorithm also for solving the nonstationary problem with fractional power elliptic operators . for the auxiliary cauchy problem, standard two-level schemes are applied. depending on the weight parameters the first and second order accuracy of the approximation is obtained. for many applied problems a small number of pseudo-time steps is su {latin small ligature ffi}cient to get a good approximation of the solution of the discrete fractional equation. the e {latin small ligature ffi}ciency of this algorithm is improved in , where a special graded grid in pseudo-time is used. another possibility to increase the accuracy of approximations is to use high order discrete schemes for solving the auxiliary pseudo-parabolic equation. in this paper we propose and investigate a fourth order three-level scheme. the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 a problem for a fractional power of elliptic operator is formulated. in section 3 the cauchy problem method is given. the main results are described in section 4, where unconditionally stable fourth-order three-level scheme is proposed and investigated. section 4 provides results of computational experiments, they illustrate the theoretical results on the approximation accuracy of fractional power problems. a model two dimensional problem is solved by using di {latin small ligature ff}erent numerical schemes. at the end of the work the main results of our study are summarized.",

usually they involve porous, or perforated plates, or panels, such that they are permeable for the gas flow. the straightforward approach to modelling the acoustic wave propagation through vibrating perforated plates consists in solving directly the vibroacoustic problem with a 3d elastic structure describing the plate. however, its numerical treatment using the finite element method can lead to an intractable problem because of the prohibitive number of dofs corresponding to the geometric complexity of the perforated structure. therefore, it is reasonable to replace the elastic plate by an interface on which coupling transmission conditions are prescribed. in this paper, we consider the acoustic wave propagation in an inviscid fluid interacting with elastic structures designed as periodically perforated plates. the aim is to derive non-local vibro-acoustic transmission conditions using the periodic homogenization method. although similar problems have been treated in the literature, cf. , in this context, the plate elasticity has not been considered yet. as for the rigid structures, semi-empirical formulae for the acoustic impedance exist which were tuned by experiments, or developed using the electro-acoustic equivalent circuit theory , or the helmholtz-kirchho {latin small ligature ff}integral theory . during the last decade, a number of works appeared which are based on a homogenization strategy. for a thin rigid perforated plate represented by interface {greek capital letter gamma}0 and characterized by the thickness {almost equal to} {greek small letter delta} it has been shown in that this interface is totally transparent for the acoustic field at the zero order {greek small letter delta}0 terms of the model which describes the limit behaviour for {greek small letter delta} {rightwards arrow}0, cf. . for a higher order approximation, an approach based on the so-called inner and outer asymptotic expansions has been developed, such that two associated acoustic fields are coupled, one being relevant in the proximity of the perforations, the other at a distance from the limit interface, see e.g. . in contrast with dealing with thin perforated interfaces only, in we were concerned with homogenization of a fictitious layer in which rigid periodically distributed obstacles were placed. in particular, a rigid plate perforated by arbitrary shaped pores could be considered. therein nonlocal transmission conditions were obtained as the two-scale homogenization limit of a standard acoustic problem imposed in the layer. here we follow the approach reported in to develop vibroacoustic transmission conditions which substitute the vibroacoustic interaction on an elastic perforated plate immersed in the acoustic fluid. up to our knowledge, despite some numerical studies, see e.g. . , a rigorous treatment of such a problem has not been treated using the homogenization method so far. as the result we obtain vibroacoustic transmission conditions in a form of 2 an implicit dirichlet-to-neumann operator. due to this operator, the elastic perforated plate can be replaced by an interface on which a jump of the global acoustic pressure is linked to the acoustic momenta associated with two faces of the homogenized plate. it allows us to obtain an e {latin small ligature ffi}cient numerical model which takes into account geometrical details of the periodic perforation without need of discretizing the vibroacoustic problem at the global level. in other words, the homogenized interface provides a reduced model in which a complex 3d elastic structure is replaced by a 2d perforated plate model whose coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients retain information about the perforation geometry. to do so, we rely on the homogenized reissner-mindlin plate tailor-made for the simple perforation represented by general cylindrical holes with axes orthogonal to the mid-plane of the plate. elastic strongly heterogeneous plates were treated in where the framework of the reissner-mindlin theory was used to derive a model of phononic plates, cf. , but without the interaction with an exterior acoustic field. the proposed modelling conception based on the problem decomposition and using the homogenization provides an alternative framework for modelling of microporous panels which are known for their capabilities of acoustic attenuation . in the so-called patch transfer functions were developed for numerical modelling of compliant micro-perforated panels. the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 2 the vibroacoustic problem of the wave propagation in a waveguide containing the perforated plate is decomposed into the problem in a fictitious transmission layer and the outer problem governing the acoustic field out of the layer. the in-layer vibroacoustic problem is treated using the homogenization method in section 3, where the local problems imposed in the representative periodic cell are introduced and formulae for the homogenized coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients are given. in section 4, as the main result of this paper, the global acoustic problem is established using the limit in-layer and the outer problems which are coupled using additional conditions derived by an additional integration and averaging procedure. the limit two-scale model of the homogenized layer is validated in section 5 using direct numerical simulations of the original problem. finally, in section 6, the proposed model is employed to simulate wave propagation in a waveguide equipped with the perforated plate. some technical auxiliary derivations are presented in the appendix. notation. in the paper, the mathematical models are formulated in a cartesian coordinate system r where o is the origin of the space and is a orthonormal basis for this space. the spatial position x in the medium is specified through the coordinates with re3 figure 1: left: the global domain decomposition into {ohm sign}+ and {ohm sign}-separated by the homogenized perforated plate represented by the interface {greek capital letter gamma}0. center: detail of the layer structure; the layer thickness is

boldface notation for vectors, a = , and for tensors, b = , is used. the gradient and divergence operators applied to a vector a are denoted by {nabla}a and {nabla} {middle dot} a, respectively. by {nabla}su we denote the symmetrized gradient {nabla}u, i.e. the strain tensor. when these operators have a subscript which is space variable, it is for indicating that the operator acts relatively at this space variable, for instance {nabla}x = . the symbol dot {left single quotation mark} {middle dot}' denotes the scalar product between two vectors and the symbol colon {left single quotation

cell y {subset of}r3 where r is the set of real numbers. by latin subscripts i, j, k, l belong to {1, 2, 3} we refere to vectorial/tensorial components in r3, whereas subscripts {greek small letter alpha}, beta belong to {1, 2} are reserved for the tangential components with respect to the plate midsurface, i.e. coordinates x {greek small letter alpha} of vector represented by x {prime} = = are associated with directions . moreover, {nabla}x = is the in-plane gradient. the gradient in the so-called dilated configuration with coordinates is denoted by {modifier letter circumflex accent} {nabla}= . we also use the jump w.r.t. the transversal coordinate, ]+/r = q -q. 2. formulation and decomposition of the vibroacoustic transmission problem the aim of the paper is to find a representation of the vibro-acoustic interaction on a perforated plate. for this, homogenized vibroacoustic transmission conditions are derived using the asymptotisc analysis w.r.t. a scale 4 parameter {greek small letter epsilon} which has a double role: on one hand it deals with the thickness of an elastic plate when considered as a 3d object, on the other hand it describes the size and spacing of holes periodically drilled in the plate structure. the flowchart of deriving the transmission conditions for a limit global problem consists of the following steps: {bullet} the vibro-acoustic problem is formulated in a domain {ohm sign}g {subset of}r3 in which the perforated elastic plate is embedded, being represented by a planar surface - the plate midsurface. {bullet} a transmission layer {ohm sign} {greek small letter delta} of the thickness {greek small letter delta} is introduced in terms of {greek capital letter gamma}0 which constitutes its midsurface. this will allow to decompose the global problem into two subproblems: the vibroacoustic interaction in the layer {ohm sign} {greek small letter delta} and the outer acoustic problems in {ohm sign}g {ohm sign} {greek small letter delta}. the two subproblems are coupled by natural transmission conditions on the fictitious interfaces {greek capital letter gamma}+/ {greek small letter delta} . {bullet} we consider the layer thickness being proportional to the scale parameter, thus, {greek small letter delta} = {greek small letter kappa} {greek small letter epsilon}, where {greek small letter kappa} > 0 is fixed. the asymptotic analysis {greek small letter delta} {almost equal to} {greek small letter epsilon} {rightwards arrow}0 considered for the problem in {ohm sign} {greek small letter delta} with the neumann type boundary conditions on {greek capital letter gamma}+/ {greek small letter delta} leads to the homogenized vibroacoustic transmission problem defined on {greek capital letter gamma}0. in this analysis, {greek small letter epsilon} has the double role announced above and the plate is described using its 2d representation in the framework of the reissner-mindlin plate theory. in remark 1 we explain the dual interpretation of the plate thickness used in the asymptotic analysis of the vibro-acoustic problem. {bullet} the final step is to derive the limit global problem for the acoustic waves in the fluid interacting with the homogenized perforated plate represented by {greek capital letter gamma}0. for this, with a few modifications we follow the approach used in , where the rigid plate was considered; a given plate thickness h corresponds to given finite thickness {greek small letter delta}0 of the transmission layer. then the continuity of the acoustic fields on interfaces {greek capital letter gamma}+/ {greek small letter delta}0 yields the homogenized vibroacoustic transmission conditions which hold on {greek capital letter gamma}0. 2.1. global problem with transmission layer in this section, we introduce the problem of acoustic waves in a domain {ohm sign}g with embedded perforated elastic plate {greek capital letter sigma} {greek small letter epsilon},

transimssion layer {ohm sign} {greek small letter delta} with a thickness {greek small letter delta} > 0, such that {greek capital letter sigma} {greek small letter epsilon} {subset of} {ohm sign} {greek small letter delta}. the plate thickness is h {greek small letter epsilon} = {greek small letter epsilon} {macron} h, while the layer thickness {greek small letter delta} = {greek small letter

differential} {greek capital letter sigma} {greek small letter epsilon} in the 3d plate representation. remark 1. in our asymptotic analysis of the acoustic transmission layer, we shall use the plate thickness in two contexts: {bullet} the periodically perforated plate model defined in terms of the 2d domain {greek capital letter gamma} {greek small letter epsilon} {subset of} {greek capital letter gamma}0 representing the mid-plane and the thickness h = {greek small letter epsilon}0 {macron} h with {greek small letter epsilon}0 > 0 being fixed. in fact, for a given thickness h and the perforation design we can obtain {macron} h. {bullet} to describe the interaction between the 3d elastic structure and the acoustic fluid, the thickness must be proportional to {greek small letter epsilon} which is also related to the transmission layer thickness {greek small letter delta} = {greek small letter kappa} {greek small letter epsilon}, thus, we consider h {greek small letter epsilon} = {greek small letter epsilon} {macron} h and the elastic body occupying domain {greek capital letter sigma} {greek small letter epsilon}, see . thus, the homogenization of the periodically perforated plate is done by pursuing the asymptotic analysis {greek small letter epsilon} {rightwards arrow}0 applied to the 2d plate model divided by h. whereas h is fixed in the plate equation operator, beeing independent of {greek small letter epsilon}, at the r.h.s. terms we get 1/ which is coherent with the dilation operation applied when dealing with fluid equation, see section 2.7.

    "Text": "the homogenized model derived in this paper provides an approximation of the vibroacoustic interaction in a vicinity of the perforated plate. this approximation is introduced as the limit behaviour of the wave propagation in the heterogeneous structure when the transmission layer thickness and the characteristic size of the perforations diminish with {greek small letter epsilon} {rightwards arrow}0. however, by virtue of coupling the limit layer model and with the outer acoustic problem, the global problem described in section 4 is featured by the specific scale parameter {greek small letter epsilon}0 associated with a given plate thickness and the perforation size. in this section, we examine how numerical responses of the proposed homogenized vibroacoustic model corresponds with solutions of the original problem associated with the 3d heterogeneous solid structure representing the plate. to this aim, the reference model is established as the finite element approximation of problem introduced in section 2. for this model, the heterogeneous structure of the transmission layer is built up as the periodic lattice by copies of the reference periodic cell according to -. the geometries associated with the homogenized and the reference models are illustrated in fig. 5, where the unit cell y *represents the fluid domain. by virtue of the asymptotic homogenization, the layer presenting a fictitious interface, highlighted by red and blue colors in fig 5, is replaced by homogenized transmission conditions imposed on the interface {greek capital letter gamma}0 in the multiscale simulation, see fig 5. the validation of the homogenized model - is performed in two steps. first, we compare the acoustic fields computed by the reference and the homogenized models, whereby the perforated plate is assumed to be rigid, see remark 4. secondly we compare the responses of the homogenized vibrating plate with the deflections obtained by direct numerical simulations of the heterogeneous 3d elastic structure. in this case, the plate surface is loaded by a given acoustic pressure distribution, thus, the vibroacoustic problem is decoupled. the reason for such a simplification arises as the consequence of the fe mesh complexity increasing with the number of the perforating holes, thus, inducing a discretized problem with large number of the degrees of freedom . for the purpose of this validation test, we consider the waveguide {ohm sign} represented by the s-shaped slice of thickness {greek small letter epsilon}0 m, as measured in the x2-axis direction, see fig. 4, where the slice dimensions are indicated. the waveguide is symmetric w.r.t. the center of the perforated plate structure which splits the acoustic domain into two mutually symmetric parts. the thickness of the perforated plate is 0.12 {greek small letter epsilon}0 m, where {greek small letter epsilon}0 = 0.3/n varies with n, 31 figure 4: the acoustic domain with the embedded perforated plate. the number of the perforation periods drawn in the x1-axis direction. the homogenized models and the reference model presented in this paper have been implemented in sfepy - simple finite elements in python , a software developed for an e {latin small ligature ffi}cient solving of multiscale problems by means of the finite element method. in the validation tests and the coupled problem simulation, by the multiscale simulations we mean solutions of the homogenized problem supplemented by the reconstruction procedure which allows us to respect the local fluctuations superimposed to the solutions of the macroscopic problem when the scale parameter {greek small letter epsilon}0 is given. 5.1. validation test - acoustic field in fluid in this test, the perforated plate is rigid, so that the distribution of the reference acoustic pressure field is governed by equations modified for the rigid plate, i.e. u = 0 in {greek capital letter sigma}. accordingly, the homogenized layer presents the coupling conditions for the acoustic field in the wave guide which is governed by . recall that the homogenized coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients a, b, f are given by expressions , involving solutions of the local problems defined in y *. for both the homogenized and the reference models an incident wave with amplitude {macron} p = 300 pa is imposed on {greek capital letter gamma}in, whereby the anechoic condition on {greek capital letter gamma}out is considered. the periodic conditions are prescribed on the two faces orthogonal to the x2-axis direction for the geometry depicted in fig. 4. responses of the reference and the homogenized models are compared using the global acoustic properties expressed by the transmission loss , and by the local distributions of the acoustic pressure. these responses were computed for the fluid characterized by the acoustic speed c = 343 m/s, the density {greek small letter rho}0 = 1.2 kg m3. the tl curves obtained for both the models are compared in fig. 6. perforations with cylindrical holes were examined for two radii r. results 32 figure 5: geometries and fe meshes of the fluid domains related to the reference and homogenized models. geometry of the periodic cell employed in the multiscale simulation and in construction of the reference geometry. 33 figure 6: transmission loss curves for the perforations with the hole radius of r = 0.1 {greek small letter epsilon}0 m and r = 0.4 {greek small letter epsilon}0 m obtained by the reference and homogenized models, n = 24. for r = 0.1 {greek small letter epsilon}0 m are depicted in fig. 6 and for r = 0.4 {greek small letter epsilon}0 m in fig. 6. from these graphs it is apparent that the result di {latin small ligature ff}er only in the vicinity of wave numbers yielding the tl peaks; in those regions associated with higher wave numbers also the shift of the peak positions can be observed. however, this e {latin small ligature ff}ect can be caused by di {latin small ligature ff}erent fe discretizations of both the models. the di {latin small ligature ff}erence of the two tl curves is displayed in fig. 6 for the two dimensions of the holes. the calculations are performed for an interval of the wave number k belong to and for {greek small letter epsilon}0 = 0.0125 which corresponds to n = 24. we also examined responses of the two models in terms of the acoustic fields fluctuations in the wave guide near to and far from the perforated plate. for this, the acoustic pressure distributions were traced along lines l1 and l2, see fig. 7. line l2 has a fixed place outside the fictitious layer while l1 lies in the layer, so that its position depends on {greek small letter epsilon}0. we perform a series of calculations for perforations with holes of radii r = 0.1 {greek small letter epsilon}0 and wave number k = 28, whereby {greek small letter epsilon}0 = 0.3/n varies for n = 12, 24, 48, 72, 96. the real parts of the acoustic pressure fields are compared in fig. 7, distributions of the imaginary parts are similar as the real parts. the pressure field phom is reconstructed using the results of the multiscale simulation and the expressions introduced in appendix a.2. we define the relative pressure error associated with a given line l as perr := x0c x0c pref l phom l x0c x0c / pref l, where {parallel to} {parallel to}l is the l2-norm which is well defined due to the conforming 34 l1, n = 12 l1, n = 96 l2, n = 12 l2, n = 96 figure 7: the real parts of the acoustic pressure along lines l1 , l2 obtained by the reference and homogenized models for n = 12 and n = 96 , holes with radius r = 0.1 {greek small letter epsilon}0 m. fe approximation of p. this error is illustrated in fig. 8 for the increasing number of perforations n. it can be seen that perr on both lines l1 and l2 is quite high, above 16%, for n = 12, however, with growing n the error decreases down to {almost equal to}1% for n = 96. the relative pressure error distribution in the whole domain {ohm sign}is shown for n = 24 in fig. 9 , the left figure shows the distribution of the pressure pref.",

    "Text": "in this paper, we derive transmission conditions which serve for coupling acoustic fluid pressure fields on an interface which represents a compliant perforated elastic plate. for this, we consider a fictitious layer which embeds the elastic plate with periodic perforation, such that the perforation period is proportional to the layer and plate thicknesses. to derive the transmission conditions, the layer is decoupled form the outer acoustic field which is respected by introducing neumann fluxes . the layer is then treated by the asymptotic analysis based on the periodic unfolding homogenization method. as the result, the layer reduces to the 2d planar manifold {greek capital letter gamma}0 where the homogenized model presents a coupled system of pdes governing the in-layer variables: the mean pressure field and the plate deflection and rotations. further averaging procedure based on a weighted integration in the transversal direction w.r.t. the layer mid-plane yields additional relationships which enable us to couple the outer acoustic field with the in-layer variables. in this way, the dirichlet-to-neumann operator is constructed which couples traces of the outer acoustic pressure 38 figure 14: acoustic pressure fields and plate deformations induced by the incident wave prescribed at the inlet of the waveguide. the plate periodic perforation is characterized by the hole radius, r = 0.1 {greek small letter epsilon}0 m, where {greek small letter epsilon}0 = 0.0025. with its normal-projected derivatives on both sides of the interface. the numerical examples reported here illustrate the validation tests which have been performed to explore the modelling errors associated with the homogenization and the 3d-to-2d dimension reduction of the layer which is replaced by the interface coupling conditions. we used the circular shape of holes, however, arbitrary shaped cylindrical holes can be considered. the validation tests were based on the comparison of responses computed using the homogenized models with the corresponding responses of reference model, here presented by direct numerical simulations of the nonhomogenized vibroacoustic problem. in these test, the convergence {greek small letter epsilon} {rightwards arrow}0 was examined by increasing the number of the periods with proportionally smaller holes. it has been demonstrated that for a su {latin small ligature ffi}ciently small {greek small letter epsilon}0, justifying the scale separation, numerical results obtained using the homogenized vibroacoustic model are quite close to the corresponding results of the dns. this observation underlines the main advantage of the homogenized model: 39 it provides very good approximation of the reference solution, but at a considerably lower computational cost than the dns solution. to illustrate the computational e {latin small ligature ff}ort reduction, in the presented examples, the piecewise linear fe approximation of the homogenized problem has only about 2 * 104 degrees of freedom at the macroscopic level, whereas the microscopic subproblems are solved each with about 1.5 * 104 dofs to get the homogenized coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients. to compute relevant results even for much simpler geometry employed in the validation test, the dns requires more than 2*105 dofs for the approximation of the acoustic field in the layer and about the similar number of dofs for the compliant elastic structure. among the topics of the future research, the homogenization-based modelling of the compliant plate with arbitrarily shaped periodic perforations presents one of the most interesting issues since such structures provide significantly bigger potential to modify the vibroacoustic transmission. first steps towards optimal design of perforated plates in the acoustic transmission problems were reported in . acknowledgment. this research was supported by project gacr 17-01618s of the scientific foundation of the czech republic and due to the european regional development fund-project application of modern technologies in medicine and industry , and in part by project lo 1506 of the czech ministry of education, youth and sports.",

    "Text": "10 1 introduction the appearance of topological defects during spontaneous breaking of symmetries constitutes a clear and profound connection between particle physics and cosmology . as the universe cools down several phase transition take place and, depending on the homotopy groups of the manifold of degenerate vacua, stable topological defects may form . in particular, the cosmic domain wall problem is a well-known potential issue of axion models . recently, it has been pointed out that majoron models can also su {latin small ligature ff}er from domain walls . to solve such a long-standing problem, several mechanisms have been proposed. being a cosmological-particle physics issue, it is not surprising that one can tackle it from both, cosmology and particle physics sides. a couple of well known solutions are: cosmic inflation and the lazarides-shafimechanism . in the first one the dangerous walls are pushed beyond the horizon, being a clear example of a cosmological solution. in the second case, one associates the spontaneously broken discrete symmetry to a gauge symmetry. this removes the physical degeneracy among the di {latin small ligature ff}erent vacua, which become gauge equivalent. another interesting solution that has been recently suggested implements the witten e {latin small ligature ff}ect to solve the domain wall problem. more exotic postinflationary solutions involve primordial black holes to perforate the walls, change their topology and destroy them . - 1 as noted by holdom , the cosmic domain wall problem seems to be associated to the breaking of symmetries by scalars. one can imagine that the degeneracy of the associated vacua disappears for theories where the breaking of peccei-quinn symmetry is dynamically triggered by new confining forces. in addition, in usual invisible axion models , the introduction of a sm singlet condensate {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter sigma} {mathematical right angle bracket}breaking pq symmetry at high energies generates a fine-tuning problem. the bare mass terms of the higgs isodoublets, {micro sign}2 u,d|hu,d|2, have to cancel almost perfectly quartic couplings of the type {greek small letter lamda}| {greek small letter sigma}|2|hu,d|2. this is nothing but the standard, well-known hierarchy problem of axion models. we conjecture that the solution of both problems is intimately related. the reason is that dynamical breaking of symmetries by fermion condensates usually brings associated instanton e {latin small ligature ff}ects, which explicity break anomalous symmetries. dynamical breaking of pq symmetry has a long history in the context of composite axion models and has gained interest recently . new strongly coupled and confining interactions have been also reconsidered recently to rise the qcd axion mass . in this work we build a minimal model where the breaking of pq symmetry arises dynamically at a high scale thanks to a new chiral confining force. in addition, we show how the associated instantons implement the instanton interference e {latin small ligature ff}ect , solving the domain wall problem. a similar construction has been explored by barr and kim . in this reference it was suggested that new confining interactions can solve the domain wall problem. however, despite it avoids the domain wall problem with a ndw = 1 scenario, it does illustrate the appearance of a phenomenological and cosmological problem, namely the overclosing of the universe by heavy stable relics. this issue seems almost unavoidable in the context of confining interactions, since they usually bring associated conserved quantum numbers. baryon number in the standard model is the most clear example. if the lightest of these unconfined bound states, which we will call hyperbaryons, is stable it might overclose the universe depending on its mass. following griest and kamionkowski , this limit is given by: {greek capital letter lamda}hc {less-than or equal to}240 tev . dangerous heavy relics can be diluted after a period of cosmic inflation. however, in such a case one might ask why we do not also use inflation to avoid the domain wall problem. we will show below which are the basic ingredients to achieve a phenomenologically successful solution to all these problems. - 2 2 the model let us consider a model based on the symmetry: g * upq * sm , with the sm factor being the local symmetry of the standard model, suc * sul * uy , and g a new confining gauge group. upq is the global, anomalous pq symmetry. all sm particles are g singlets. for simplicity, we assume that the pq charges for sm fermions are given by fermion chirality, this is +1 for left-handed fermions and -1 for right-handed fermions1. this assignment is compatible with the original pqww and dfsz axion model . in the g sector, we assume one of the fermions has pq charge +1 while the other has no pq charge. the reason for this will become clear later. therefore, the fermion content of the model is given by: qi l {tilde operator}1 , li l {tilde operator}1 , ui r {tilde operator}-1 , di r {tilde operator}-1 , ei r {tilde operator}-1 , {greek small letter psi}1 {tilde operator}1 , {greek small letter psi}2 {tilde operator}0 , where the first quantum number stands for g and the subscript is the pq charge. the distinction between {greek small letter psi}1 and {greek small letter psi}2 requires the coupling to di {latin small ligature ff}erent scalar fields. it can be seen that upq symmetry is anomalous under both, qcd and g. this is a reasonable assumption, since it seems rather artificial to protect an anomalous symmetry from anomalies of another gauge group. the first question that arises is which kind of groups are appropriate for g. many possibilities emerge. however, one has to deal with the limitations coming from the g triangle anomaly. as we will see below g = so, for n {greater-than or equal to}2, suggest themselves as the most natural choice. strikingly enough, they admit complex, chiral representations and are anomaly free. the use of spinor representations will also be important to solve the heavy relic problem. from now on, we will assume the g gauge group is given by the well known group: g = sohc , and we will refer to it as hypercolor . this interaction becomes strongly coupled and confining at the hc scale, {greek capital letter lamda}hc. the hc fermions previously mentioned in eq. are a couple of sohc spinors, {greek small letter psi}1 {tilde operator}1 and {greek small letter psi}2 {tilde operator}0. the scalars required to distinguish them are 1this particular choice is compatible with an underlying so gut . - 3 sohc vectors h1 {tilde operator}2 , h2 {tilde operator}0 . therefore, the yukawa lagrangian of the hc sector is given by: lhc = y1 {macron} {greek small letter psi}1 ch 1 {greek small letter psi}1 + y2 {macron} {greek small letter psi}2 ch 2 {greek small letter psi}2 . notice that due to pq charge assignement {greek small letter psi}1 and {greek small letter psi}2 do not mix. while the scalar h1 develops a non-zero vacuum expectation value below the hc scale {mathematical left angle bracket}h1 {mathematical right angle bracket}< {greek capital letter lamda}hc , we assume that h2 has an inverted phase transition as in . this inverted phase transition is characterized by a non-zero vev, {mathematical left angle bracket}h2 {mathematical right angle bracket} {combining long solidus overlay}= 0, above a critical cosmic termperature t {greater-than or equal to}tc. below this temperature, t {less-than or equal to}tc, the vev vanishes {mathematical left angle bracket}h2 {mathematical right angle bracket}= 0 and, since gauge symmetry does not allow a bare mass term for so spinors, {greek small letter psi}2 becomes exactly massless. it was shown by weinberg that this kind of phase transitions can exist . we also require that the hc confinement scale is larger than the critical temperature, {greek capital letter lamda}hc {greater-than or equal to}tc {much greater-than} {greek capital letter lamda}qcd so that pq and the chiral symmetry of {greek small letter psi}2 do not coexist as classical symmetries of the lagrangian2. as in the su family, so gauge theories have non-trivial vacuum for n {greater-than or equal to}3. this can be seen from their non-trivial homotopy group, e.g. {greek small letter pi}3) = z ) = *2). there are two di {latin small ligature ff}erent {greek small letter theta}-terms, one for qcd and one for hc. since we are imposing a unique pq symmetry it might seem that we are not solving the strong cp problem, as one usually needs the same number of anomalous symmetries than {greek small letter theta}-terms or confining interactions. however, being a chiral representation, the spinor does not allow a bare mass term. as we have seen, this implies that {greek small letter psi}2 is massless after the inverted phase transition . it is well known that the topological susceptibility vanishes when there is a fermion with zero mass . since the topological susceptibility is the second derivative of the vacuum energy respect to {greek small letter theta}hc, the theory is {greek small letter theta}hc independent below tc. this fact renders {greek small letter theta}hc unphysical while {greek small letter theta}qcd is driven dynamically to zero by the standard pq mechanism. this situation resembles the one proposed by barr and kim in their work . 3 the instanton interference e {latin small ligature ff}ect since we are extending the qcd axion model with a new confining interaction there are two potential sources of explicit pq symmetry breaking. in general, qcd and hc instantons 2recently a low-scale version with {greek capital letter lamda}hc {much less-than} {greek capital letter lamda}qcd has also been proposed . - 4 will break upq symmetry explicitly, generating two independent cosine-like potentials for the axion field: vqcd and vhc with periodicities 2 {greek small letter pi}/nqcd and 2 {greek small letter pi}/nhc, respectively. therefore, the breaking of upq is done in the direction of znhc and znqcd discrete subgroups, with nhc and nqcd the anomaly coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients. this may lead to an interesting situation where the explicit breaking is not in the direction of the same subgroup. the residual discrete symmetry unbroken by the combination of non-perturbative e {latin small ligature ff}ects will be the common subgroup of both, znhc and znqcd. this is what we call instanton interference and can be pictorially visualized in figure 1. if the anomaly coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients nhc and nqcd are co-prime numbers, the instanton interference completely solves the domain wall problem, since znhc and znqcd have no common subgroup. the anomaly coe {latin small ligature ffi}cients are given by n = 2 x r qrtr , with tr the dynkin index of the representation r, defined in terms of the group generators as tr = tr {greek small letter delta}ab, and qr the pq charge of r. for su groups the indices are tn = 1/2 and tadj = n for the fundamental and adjoint representation, respectively. on the other hand, for so the indices are given by t2n = 1 and tspinor = 2n-4, for the fundamental and spinor representations. there is, however, a subtlety related to the high-scale iie. if one wants to preserve the pq solution to the strong cp problem the hc interaction must be turned o {latin small ligature ff}below a certain critical temperature, tc {much greater-than} {greek capital letter lamda}qcd, as explained above. in other words, there is no epoch when both hc and qcd potentials are turned on. this implies that the highscale iie works only when nhc = 13. in this case, the axion string-wall system decays soon after it is formed, at t {tilde operator} {greek capital letter lamda}hc, and the axion field takes the same value everywhere. consequently, when qcd instantons turn on at much smaller temperatures, t {tilde operator} {greek capital letter lamda}qcd, no axionic domain wall can form because the minimum of the axion field is the same even in causally disconnected regions thanks to the interference e {latin small ligature ff}ect of the hc instantons. in the case of the hc sector of the previous section, a straightforward calculation give us n = 4. however, one realizes that these vacua are actually related by a gauge transformation leading to an e {latin small ligature ff}ective nhc = 1, as the high-scale iie requires. 3.1 scalar potential and nqcd the scalar potential of the model described above is relatively simple. since the model is dfsz-like in the sm sector, the part of the scalar potential corresponding to the higgs 3note that this is not the case for the low-scale version of the iie where nhc can be di {latin small ligature ff}erent from 1 as long as it is relatively prime to nqcd. this is because for the low-scale version, the hc and qcd axion potentials are both turned on at low energies. see for details. - 5 doublets coupling to sm fermions is given by4: v = {micro sign}2 u| {greek small letter phi}u|2 + {micro sign}2 d| {greek small letter phi}d|2 + {greek small letter lamda}u| {greek small letter phi}u|4 + {greek small letter lamda}d| {greek small letter phi}d|4 + {greek small letter lamda}1| {greek small letter phi}u|2| {greek small letter phi}d|2 + {greek small letter lamda}2 + h.c , where {greek small letter phi}u {tilde operator}2 , {greek small letter phi}d {tilde operator}2 , couple to up-type and down-type fermions, respectively. the degeneracy of the vacuum is determined by the gauge invariant order parameters. this potential, in combination with the pq charges of and the anomaly coe {latin small ligature ffi}cient computed as dictated by eq., reveals a znqcd = z3 symmetry among the di {latin small ligature ff}erent vacua. therefore, we have a situation with nhc = 1, nqcd = 3 and the iie solves the domain wall problem as explained above. to avoid the emergence of an extra, unwanted u symmetry it is crucial to connect the hc sector, in particular the {greek small letter psi}1 and h1 fields, to the sm. this is done by the quartic term {increment}v = {greek small letter lamda}mix h1h1 + h.c. then the pq symmetry is connected to the hc sector and the iie operates. this term is also important to connect the spontaneous breaking of pq symmetry to the hc scale and not to the ew scale. a last comment regarding the scalar sector is that it might seem one can redefine pq symmetry by taking into account an apparent chiral u {greek small letter psi}2 symmetry associated to {greek small letter psi}2. such a redefinition would be broken only by qcd instantons in a similar way to the standard dynamical axion . this is however not necessarily the case. one can easily imagine that due to terms like {micro sign}2h2h2 or {greek small letter lamda}|h1|2h2h2 {greek small letter psi}2 in the potential) this redefinition of pq symmetry is not allowed. in this case, pq symmetry is necessarily anomalous under both qcd and hc and the iie works to solve the domain wall problem. note that even in this case there is still a z4 symmetry, with {greek small letter psi}2 and h2 transforming as {greek small letter psi}2 {rightwards arrow}ei {greek small letter pi}/2 {greek small letter psi}2 , h2 {rightwards arrow}-h2 , that prevents the {greek small letter psi}2 fermion of getting a mass below tc. 3.2 the {greek small letter eta} {prime}hc and the axion as we have seen before the {greek small letter theta}hc term is not physical due to the massless hc fermion, {greek small letter psi}2. this makes the axion potential coming from hc instantons flat below tc. in the dual description, after confinement, this {greek small letter theta}hc-term is relaxed dynamically by the {greek small letter eta} {prime} hc, which 4we do not consider, at this point, quartic and bare mass terms involving h1 and h2 since they are not relevant for the determination of znqcd. - 6 figure 1. the iie pitorically: a given u is broken, by instantons, to a zn and a zm discrete symmetries. if n and m are co-prime numbers there is no common subgroup and the u is completely broken. this example illustrates the mechanism for n = 2 and m = 3. it can be easily seen that the blue and red dots only coincide in one point . acquires a mass of the order {greek capital letter lamda}hc and decouples from the low-energy theory. with the axion potential coming from hc instantons, vhc, turned o {latin small ligature ff}below tc, only qcd e {latin small ligature ff}ects generate a mass for the axion giving the usual qcd prediction : m2 a {tilde operator} mumd 2 f2 {greek small letter pi}m2 {greek small letter pi} f2 a . as we will see below, fa is also identified with {greek capital letter lamda}hc, since the condensate {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter psi}1 {greek small letter psi}1 {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator} {greek capital letter lamda}3 hc breaks pq symmetry spontaneously. the hc scale, {greek capital letter lamda}hc {tilde operator}fa, is presumably very large making the qcd axion naturally invisible. 4 avoiding heavy stable relics new confining interactions can have a non-trivial cosmological impact. for su gauge groups, a global u symmetry analogous to baryon number protects the stability of the lightest hyperbaryon. as an example, a su theory with a fermion in the fundamental n representation has a stable hyperbaryon composed by n fermions. analogously, so groups feature a z2 conserved quantum number. this z2 symmetry counts the number of indices for the fundamental representation and can stabilize the lightest bound state. these group theoretic properties have been used to stabilize dark matter . another example of exotic matter stabilized by the conserved z2 symmetry of an so confining interaction are hyperbaryons in the context of comprehensive unification . it was shown long ago by griest and kamionkowski that a stable particle that was in thermal equilibrium may overclose the universe if it is very heavy . by using partial - 7 wave unitarity of the s-matrix, one can estimate the relic density today as: {ohm sign} {greek small letter chi}h2 {almost equal to}10-5 2 . such a stable relic {greek small letter chi} would produce an unacceptable dm relic density {ohm sign} {greek small letter chi}h2 > {ohm sign}dmh2 or even {ohm sign} {greek small letter chi} {greater-than or equal to}1 if it is heavier than o tev. one can naively think that because sohc is confining, there will be stable hyperbaryons. however, this is not the case. when the interaction becomes strongly coupled, hc dynamics will form the condensate: {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter psi}1 {greek small letter psi}1 {mathematical right angle bracket} {tilde operator} {greek capital letter lamda}3 hc . as mentioned before, this condensate breaks upq spontaneously. additionally, the condensate has also non-trivial implications in the dynamics of sohc itself. here we briefly describe the situation. in the single gauge boson exchange approximation the potential between two {greek small letter psi} is given by: v {tilde operator}g2 hc 2r , with c16 and cc the casimir invariants of the spinor and the possible representations of the condensate. interestingly this condensate does not contain an so singlet since: 16 * 16 = 10s + 120a + 126s . therefore, the condensate must break sohc gauge symmetry. this is done following the most attractive channel rules . since the only attractive channel is in the 10 representation direction, which contains a so singlet, the symmetry breaking reads: so {rightwards arrow}so , 16 {rightwards arrow}16 . the strongly coupled so interaction, again, rearrange the vacuum and form condensates {mathematical left angle bracket} {greek small letter psi}1 {greek small letter psi}1 {mathematical right angle bracket}5. however, this condensate now contains an so singlet, since: 16 * 16 = 1s + 9s + 36a + 84a + 126s . the ssb chain of the confining interaction stops at this point and the so remains unbroken. we are now about to show why no dangerous heavy relics emerge in our framework. for so with n odd there are two conjugacy classes. the conjugacy classes of the 5the mac rules state that the fermions involved in the condensate get a non-zero mass. therefore we need to assume that only {greek small letter psi}1 form condensates while {greek small letter psi}2 remains massless. - 8 spinor and singlet representations are c = 1 and c = 0, respectively. since the product of representations decomposes into representations with the same class , only products of an even number of spinors can give us so singlets. therefore, since so supports a conserved z2 quantum number instead of u, no stable so singlet can appear. all the possible hyperbaryons, i.e. so singlet bound states, are z2 singlets and decay. in more detail, since both {greek small letter psi}1 and {greek small letter psi}2 are lighter than the hc scale the lightest bound states are hc-mesons composed by two so spinors. note this di {latin small ligature ff}ers from a pure yangmills theory where the lightest bound states are glueballs. hc-mesons are allowed to decay into sm degrees of freedom through hc anomaly diagrams and the interaction in eq. 3.4 , which connects the hc and sm sectors. since hc-mesons have tipically masses of the order of the hc scale {greek capital letter lamda}hc, their lifetime is expected to be extremely short. 5 hc coupling running and confinement we have assumed that the hc interaction becomes strongly coupled at high energies. for the sake of completeness, let us study an explicit example quantitatively. if some kind of new physics like supersymmetry or new scalars is responsible of the unification of gauge couplings at high energies, it is attractive to imagine that the hc interaction is also unified with the other sm interactions at around mgut {tilde operator}1016 gev. at one loop and neglecting threshold corrections, the evolution of the couplings is governed by: {greek small letter alpha}-1 = {greek small letter alpha}-1 + 1 6 {greek small letter pi} ln m {micro sign} , with c2) = n -2, and t = 2n/2-4. with two hc spinors and no light scalars, this give us: {greek small letter alpha}-1 hc = {greek small letter alpha}-1 hc -80 6 {greek small letter pi} ln m {micro sign} . taking a supersymmetric example, if {greek small letter alpha}hc = 1/28 and mgut = 1016 gev, one can estimate the scale {greek capital letter lamda}hc at which the hc coupling becomes strong as: {greek capital letter lamda}hc {almost equal to}e-27*6 {greek small letter pi}/80 * 1016 . we obtain {greek capital letter lamda}hc {almost equal to}1.7*1013 gev, which lies close to the upper bound of the axion window . the hc scale can be lowered if {greek small letter alpha} < 1/28 or if there is extra matter in the hc sector below the gut scale, making the running of the coupling slower. then, one can easily obtain a hc scale {greek capital letter lamda}hc inside the qcd axion window. obviously, the coincidence of all interaction strengths in one point of the plane is meaningless unless there is an underlying unified gauge group in the uv. the -

10 be the crucial ingredient to explain the absence of heavy stable relics. this fact strongly suggest them as compelling candidates for the confining interaction of composite axion models. acknowledgments i am especially grateful to r. fonseca for helpful discussions about group theory and p. agrawal for discussions and insightful comments during the early stages of this work. i am also grateful to m. yamada and p. quilez for enlightening discussions about a preliminary version of the manuscript. i would also like to thank stockholm university and the organizers of the quantum connections: axions in stockholm workshop, where this work started, for hospitality. this work is supported by the spanish grants fpa2017-85216p , sev-2014-0398 and prometeo/2018/165 .",

    "Text": "with the ever-increasing amount of traffic that goes through the network, network management has become a difficult task. one of the most important tasks in network management is identifying the types of traffic that are passing through the network. classifying the applications is a fairly simple task with high evaluation metrics. additionally, ntcs have been able to take care of this matter efficiently. two major purposes of ntcs are detecting anomalies in the network and classification of applications for quality of service purposes , . there have been several types of ntcs that use different methods for handling the task at hand, however, each one has its own drawbacks. these methods are generally divided into three categories as follows {bullet} port-based: this approach is not efficient since some applications do not use a specific port e.g, bittorrent. moreover, if the port is changed, this method is no longer reliable . {bullet} deep packet inspection : these applications use the patterns in the payloads of packets for classification. they generally have three major drawbacks. the first one is that they need to be updated with new patterns in the payloads of emerging applications . in addition, they are not able to identify all of the flows. furthermore, if we do not have access to the payload of packets for privacy reasons, their accuracy is very much affected. {bullet} machine learning based: the flaws of the two above methods has gained attention to the third type of classifiers, which use machine learning and specifically deep learning algorithms. this type of algorithms usually work with the features in the header of the packets, but some of them may also take into account the information in the payloads , . although they are still limited, they have shown great potential in terms of evaluation metrics and will be a great substitution in the future for the aforementioned methods. most of the traces that are gathered from real internet traffic are imbalanced i.e, some types of application flows are generally more populated than others e.g, http -. this matter is a lot bolder when it comes to large-scale traffic and will cause some serious problems in the way of algorithms' f1 measure. augmentation is an approach in machine learning that addresses the issue of small amount of data for training. this approach usually tries to increase the training data in a way that can be still classified in the same category. augmentation is a popular method used especially in image classification and can be done through methods like cropping, zooming, rotating, and filliping vertically or horizontally. another way of achieving augmentation is through generating artificial data for a class. in order to address the challenges of machine learning arxiv:1901.00204v1 1 jan 2019 algorithms in imbalanced network datasets, we introduce a novel augmentation method to improve the accuracy of deep learning algorithms on real-world traffic traces by using kde and lstm. the remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in section ii we review the related works in the area of ntcs. in section iii we describe our augmentation scheme. the dataset and deep learning model that was used in order to classify the traffic traces are mentioned in sections iv and v, respectively. finally, the evaluation of our method is demonstrated in section vi.",

    "Text": "due to the high variety in the classes, datasets, and performance metrics that are used in this area, having a comparison between the works in this subject is a difficult task . considering this, there are several well-known pieces of research that are done up to this point. there are several works that have applied deep learning architectures or neural networks in order to solve the classification problem. in lopez-martin et al. have presented a deep convolutional recurrent neural network architecture in order to classify network flows and have found the best setting in that environment in terms of hyper-parameters and feature set. nevertheless, they have not taken any measures to handle the imbalance problem of their dataset. additionally, the scale of their dataset is approximately fifth of the one that we are using. in rahul et al. have also proposed using convolutional neural networks in order to classify network traffic but only consider three classes of applications in their work on a limited amount of data. in a comparison between cnn and stacked autoencoders in order to classify not only types of traffic but also applications in the network in a standard vpn/none-vpn dataset in packet level has been given. the scheme that was used, unlike ours, relies on the features from both header and payload of packets which may not be available in some privacy-preserving datasets. finally, in auld et al. have deploy a bayesian neural network in the form of a multi-layer perception and accordingly classify their dataset. in this work, the lowest performance metrics are from the classes with the lowest number of data. some works in this area have attempted to battle the imbalanced property through different measures. in rotsos et al. have introduced a method through probabilistic graphical models for semi-supervised learning in a naive bayes model. for their learning, they have assumed a dirichlet distribution prior for the classes with high {greek small letter alpha} value. this is based on the assumption that some classes have a higher probability than others. in addition, in , an augmentation method has been proposed by using an auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network , although only two classes of network is considered: ssh and none-ssh. furthermore, their method is table i: features of each flow feature type source port numerical destination port inter-arrival time payload length direction of packet sequential tcp window size only evaluated on traditional machine learning algorithms like support vector machines, random forest, and naive bayes. also has presented a new feature extraction method using a divide and conquer approach for an imbalanced dataset in the network. as an instance of lstm used for generating sequential data, has introduced a method to generate data using lstm and evaluated the method to show that it can capture the temporal features in the dataset. lstm has also been used as an augmentation tool in works such as and for generating handwriting and human movement data, respectively, and has proven to be efficient in both cases. iii. augmentation scheme for generating time series network data in this section, we describe our contribution of augmentation scheme for generating new data in network traffic traces. every flow in the network has the same 5-tuple attributes: {bullet} source ip address. {bullet} destination ip address. {bullet} source port number. {bullet} destination port number. {bullet} link layer protocol e.g, tcp and udp. every application in the internet creates a flow of packets between communicating peers . in order to represent flows in our work, we have to choose a set of features for each one that can capture the nature of a flow. according to , the appropriate set of features that will give acceptable results for classifying flows are mentioned in table i. these features are gathered for the first 20 packets of each flow, which are more than enough for capturing the temporal and spatial features of a flow. as shown in table i, we can put the features in two categories: sequential and numerical. each group has its own way of augmentation which are described in the following. a. generating sequential features in this section, we demonstrate our approach to generating sequential features. as mentioned earlier, traffic flow comprises the sequence of packets that are transmitted between a source and a destination. some applications are uni-directional i.e, the packets are only transmitted in one direction e.g, uploading a data. however, in some type of applications, packets go in both directions such as when a client is communicating with the server and gets a response for its request. whether a packet is sent from source or destination depends on the sequence of packets that have already been sent up to this point in the flow. therefore, we can conclude that the sequence of directions of packets in a specific application is of time-series nature and can be generated through means of sequence generation like in , . tcp window size is another feature of the flow that is dependent on the previous values in the flow. generally, this value is an indicator of the conditions of the connection and processing speed of data in the flow . thus, its amount at each step of the flow is affected by previous steps' values. one of the most common ways to generate a sequence is using recurrent neural networks , which try to learn the patterns in time-series data e.g, speech, music, text, etc . in our work, we use one type of rnns called lstm networks . each lstm block tries to learn the probability distribution in a step of a sequence whilst taking into consideration the information from previous steps. in order to train the network, we gathered the patterns of packet directions in a flow for up to 20 packets in a class of flow application. we encode every direction by 1 or 0 with the former being from source to destination and the latter is the other way around. at the end of each sequence, we put a unique character as an indicator of the ending of the flow. then every sequence is shifted by one character to the right and is used as labels in order to train each step of generation in lstm. in the generation phase, first, we choose a direction based on the distribution of that direction in the dataset for the first time step and give that as input to the lstm. afterwards, we use the output of each step as probability distribution of each character and generate a new direction. then, we feed that output direction to lstm in order to generate next step probabilities. the maximum number of steps are 19 in order to generate the pattern of flow up to 20 packets . let xt and ht denote the direction of the packet in the dataset and the generated direction by the lstm at time step t, respectively. therefore, the generation process is demonstrated in fig. 1. in order to generate window size values, we use the same scheme, although the characters in this case are the values of window sizes in our dataset instead of 0 and 1. b. generating numerical features in this section, we describe our method of generating numerical features of a flow. as shown in table i, we consider four numerical features for each packet of the flow. in order to generate new samples from these features, first, we need to learn their probability distribution. since these features are not sequential, we can use conventional probability density distribution estimation methods. one of these methods is kde that is in the category of kernel methods. kde, also known as the parzen-rosenblatt window, is one of the most famous methods used to estimate the probability density function of a dataset. kde, as a non-parametric density fig. 1. generating 19 time steps of packet sequence with lstm estimator, does not have any assumptions about the density function as opposed to the parametric family of algorithms. this method will learn the shape of the density from the data automatically. this flexibility that arises from its nonparametric nature, makes kde a very popular method for data drawn from a complicated distribution. let x = {x1, x2, , xn} denote the set of independent and identically distributed random samples from a group of features e.g, inter-arrival time and k : i rd 7 {rightwards arrow}i r denote the probability distribution function of the kernel of our choosing. then we can estimate the pdf of x by {modifier letter circumflex accent} p = 1 nhd n x i=1 k, where {modifier letter circumflex accent} p is the estimated pdf of x and h > 0 is the bandwidth of the kernel that is used to control the smoothing degree of the kernel , . the common examples of k is gaussian distribution with {micro sign} = 0 and {greek small letter sigma} = 1 as expressed by k = 1 {square root} 2 {greek small letter pi} e-2/2, which is also used for our scheme. in order to prevent bias-variance problem in fixed h cases, we used the bandwidth selection method represented in . according to if a gaussian kernel is used, it can be shown that the optimal value of h is h*= x10 4 {modifier letter circumflex accent} {greek small letter sigma}5 3n x11 1 5 .",

    "Text": "while much previous research on expression invariant 3d face recognition has focused on modelling expressions and detecting expression insensitive facial parts, there have been relatively few studies evaluating the potential of the nasal region for addressing this issue. despite this, the nose has a number of salient features that make it suitable for expression robust recognition. it can be easily detected, due to its discriminant curvature and convexity , is difficult to hide without attracting suspicion , , is relatively stable over various facial expressions and is rarely affected by unintentional occlusions caused by hair and scarves. although it has been reported that the 2d image of the nose has too few discriminant features to be used as a reliable region for human identification , its 3d surface has much undiscovered potential. this paper further investigates the 3d nasal region for human identity authentication and verification purposes and presents a novel algorithm that provides very high discriminant strength, comparable with recent 3d face recognition algorithms, which use the whole facial domain. the proposed approach is based on a very consistent and accurate landmarking algorithm, which overcomes the issue of robust segmentation of the nasal region. the algorithm first finds an approximate location of the nose tip and then finely tunes its location, while accurately determining the position of the nasal root and detecting the symmetry plane of the face. next, the locations of three sets of landmarks are found: subnasale, eye corners and nasal alar groove. these landmarks are utilised on feature maps created by applying multi-resolution gabor wavelets to the surface normals of the depth map. two types of feature descriptors are used: spherical patches and nasal curves. feature selection is then performed using a heuristic genetic algorithm and, finally, the expression-robust feature descriptors are applied to the well-known and widely used 3d face recognition grand challenge , bosphorus and binghamton university 3d facial expression datasets. results show the algorithm's high potential to recognise nasal regions, and hence faces, over different expressions, with very few gallery samples per subject. the highest rank-one recognition rates achieved are: 1) a r1rr of 97.9% and equal error rate of 2.4% for frgc v2.0 and receiver operator characteristic iii experiments, respectively; 2) a r1rr of 98.45% and 98.5% for frgc's neutral vs. neutral and neutral vs. non-neutral samples, respectively; 3) a r1rr of 96.2% when one gallery sample per subject is used for the frgc dataset vs. 4330 probe samples); 4) a r1rr of 95.35% for the bosphorus dataset when 2797 scans of 105 subjects are used as probes and the set of 105 neutral scans is used as the galley. january 3, 2019 draft 3 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. after the literature review provided in section ii, the alignment and nasal region cropping steps, followed by the nasal region landmarking, are detailed in section iii. the feature extraction algorithm is described in section iv and section v explains the feature descriptors used. the feature selection algorithm is detailed in section vi and experimental results, including a thorough comparison with previous work, is provided in section vii. finally, conclusions are given in section viii. a. scientific contribution and comparison with previous work the major contribution of this paper is a novel surface normal-based recognition algorithm that provides a thorough evaluation of the recognition potential of the 3d nasal region. the results achieved are not only better than previous 3d nose recognition algorithms but also higher than many recognition algorithms that employ the whole face. the algorithm employs a novel, training-free, highly consistent and accurate landmarking algorithm for the nasal region and a robust feature space, based on the response of gabor wavelets to surface normal vectors, is also introduced. to localise the expression robust regions on the nose a heuristic ga feature selection is applied to two different geometrical feature descriptors. because of the smoothing effects of the gabor wavelets, there is no need for sophisticated denoising algorithms. indeed, only simple median filtering is required for the surface normals, even with noisy datasets such as the frgc spring 2003 folder. an additional advantage of the proposed approach is that a fast principal component analysis -based self-dependent method can be employed for facial pose correction. this eliminates the need for sophisticated pose correction algorithms or reference faces for fine tuning the alignment. the proposed approach significantly extends our previous work in which the nasal landmarking and recognition was performed on the depth map. this paper increases the number of landmarks and their detection accuracy and presents new feature extraction and selection algorithms. the work is inspired by recent algorithms on utilising facial normal vectors in 3d and regional normal vectors . to compare the new algorithms with previous approaches which used similar methodologies, the application of normals, computed over the nasal surface, is used for identification as well as the verification scenario. by using multi-resolution gabor wavelets the ability of the algorithm to handle more noisy samples is enhanced, providing higher r1rr than the approach of li et al. , which excluded the noisy frgc spring 2003 samples. this work also extends the application of facial curves, introduced as feature descriptors by berretti et al. , to nasal spherical patches, producing a r1rr increase of > 2%, and showing a higher class separability for the spherical patches than for curves for 3d face january 3, 2019 draft 4 recognition.",

    "Text": "robustness against the deformations caused by facial expressions has been a popular research topic in 3d face recognition. the face is a non-rigid object and therefore 3d matching techniques for rigid objects, such as the iterative closest point algorithm , can become trapped in local minima and fail to provide accurate matching scores. an empirical approach to deal with the variations caused by expressions is to capture a range of facial expressions for each subject and store them in the gallery . then, the facial biometric features of each test subject can be compared with all the stored expressions and a decision made on the identity of the subject. this method has numerous disadvantages: capturing a range of facial expressions for each subject is not always straightforward and requires a high storage capacity per subject. in addition, facial expressions will not necessarily remain constant and may differ between the test and gallery captures . one approach to overcome this problem is to use computer graphics algorithms to artificially create different expressions for each facial capture. in , expressions are learned using pca eigenvectors and then used to re-generate the expressions on the probe samples. although this approach does not require multiple samples per subject in the gallery, it is still vulnerable to the number of training samples used to model the facial expressions. also, a universal definition of facial expression for all subjects still remains to be found and the need to classify the expression types prior to face recognition increases the computational complexity. another approach is to employ region-based methods, in which the least variant parts of the face over different expressions are detected using facial segmentation , , , or extracted using their expression invariant capabilities , , , . spreeuwers proposes a multiple regional approach based on a pca-linear discriminant analysis feature extraction method . in regional recognition, scores from a combination of different masks on the nose, cheek, forehead, chin and mouth are fused to finalise the decision making. aly {diaeresis} uz et al. use a regional registration algorithm in conjunction with lda classifiers, giving an expression robust 3d face recognition approach . they also demonstrate that the nasal region has a high discriminatory power. a focus on integrating multiple regions is provided by queirolo et al. in which four regions are segmented and stored for the gallery sessions before matching is performed using a novel matching criterion, called the january 3, 2019 draft 5 surface interpenetration measure, and simulated annealing. using facial curves is another popular approach to 3d face recognition that can be categorised as a subset of regional algorithms. drira et al. use the intersections of planes with the facial surface to define a set of radial curves which pass through the nose tip, and then perform a quality assessment in order to handle missing data and occlusions . another curve-based algorithm is proposed by berretti et al. . first, keypoints are detected on the facial surface and then the least variant curves on the face are selected using a statistical model and matched with those in the gallery. as an extension to curves, isogeodesic stripes centralised on the nose tip are used in an expression invariant 3d face recognition method that employs a novel descriptor, termed the 3d weighted walkthroughs, to quantify the differences between corresponding stripes . in another curve-based approach, drira et al. find geodesic curves on the nasal region for a subset of the frgc dataset . to overcome the sensitivity of holistic face recognition algorithms to expression variations, mian et al. propose a landmark-based method, in conjunction with a localised feature descriptor that incorporates the 2d texture and 3d point clouds. in an alternative approach, wang et al. apply shape difference boosting to the bosphorus dataset to learn the expressions and identify those facial regions which remain constant over different expressions . instead of using depth or the point coordinates for 3d registration, mohammadzade et al. use the surface normals of the points in conjunction with a fisher's discriminant paradigm . this approach selects the normals which maximise the concentration of within-class scatter while simultaneously maximising the between-class distribution. recently, li et al. proposed local normals histograms, captured from multiple rectangular regions on the face, to set up an expression-robust feature space and use a novel sparse classifier to perform the matching . despite the robustness of these algorithms against facial expressions, they often rely on accurate and consistent facial segmentation, which is not a straightforward task in 3d. to address this issue, some researches have focused on the nasal region, which shows high consistency over different expressions. for example, in one of the first investigations on 3d nose recognition, chang et al. initially segment the face into different non-overlapping regions, using the curvature information . then, three overlapping nasal regions are detected and stored in the gallery. the same regions are segmented in the probe images and matched using the icp algorithm. wang et al. propose the use of local shape difference boosting for 3d face recognition and also apply the boosting algorithm to different nasal regions . the regions are cropped using the intersection of spheres of radius r, centred on the nose tip, with the face surface. when the value of r was increased, the recognition ranks reached a maximum and then plateaued. a combination of the nasal region, forehead and eyes are used for a 2d/3d face recognition by mian et january 3, 2019 draft 6 initial nasal root estimation fine tuning nasal root and tip update the nose region's point clouds eye

rotation is required because some of the original curves are strictly decreasing functions that do not have an actual minimum. assuming p = is a k * 2 matrix representing points of a curve, instead of directly differentiating p to find the minima on the curves, as proposed by segundo et al. , the curves are first rotated in the z-axis by an angle {greek small letter alpha} around a given point on

which zk l and zk r are the depth maps of the flipped and cropped left and right sides of l4j and l1i, respectively. the two points l1opt and l4opt that minimise ek have the most similar values of zopt l and zopt r and their projections onto the x axis correspond to the x values of the accurate nose tip and root locations such that, {greek small letter theta}opt z = arg min {greek small letter

normal vector , see fig. 4-b. the locations of the maximum and minimum of the resulting curve are the positions of l1opt y and l4opt y . this procedure is illustrated in fig. 4. l4 = and l1 = give the final locations of the nose tip and nasal root, respectively. the points on the same curve, which are located below the nasal tip l4 are then rotated around l4 by an angle {greek small letter phi}.

where r0, a1 and a2 are scalar constants determining the length and directivity of the lobes in the roi. these are chosen to be able to crop the nasal alar region, while avoiding redundant parts . r and {greek small letter theta} are the distance from the nose tip and angular rotation from the horizontal axis passing the nose tip location, respectively. similarly, the roi used to detect the eye corners is depicted in fig. 5-c and is found using, r {prime} = uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 r {prime} 0 cosa3 0 {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter theta} {prime} < {greek small letter pi} r {prime} 0 cosa4 {greek small letter pi} {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter theta} {prime} < 2 {greek small letter pi} , in which r {prime} 0 = 45 mm, a3 = 4 and a4 = 0.75. the polar coordinate system is characterised by r {prime} and {greek small letter theta} {prime}, which are the distance from the nasal root and the angular rotation from the horizontal axis passing l1, respectively. planes parallel with the xz-plane are then intersected with each row of the rois. for the jth and kth intersections over the nasal alar groove and eye corner rois, curves qj and q {prime}k are found, respectively, and is used to find three minima for the nasal alar groove, january 3, 2019 draft 12 uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 rminj = v3, {greek small letter zeta} lminj = v3, {greek small letter eta} and the eye corners, uf8f1 uf8f2 uf8f3 rmin {prime} k = v3, {greek small letter zeta} lmin {prime} k = v3, {greek small letter eta} , where {rminj, lminj} and {rmin {prime} k, lmin {prime} k} are matrices with three rows, in which each row has the location of the lowest minimum found from the jth and kth rows of the rois, for the right and left sides of l4 and l1, respectively. then, for each row, rminj and lminj are compared and the pairs with the most similar euclidean distances to the nose tip l4 selected. using a similar approach, the distance of rmin {prime} k and lmin {prime} k to l1 for each row is computed and those pairs with the most similar distances kept. figures 5-b and -c illustrate these processes. the points found as candidates for the nasal alar groove and eye corners might contain some outliers. this is because of the imaging noise and deformations on the face due to the facial expressions. to remove the outliers, an iterative approach is used. first, the 3d euclidean distances between the points on each consecutive row are computed. then the standard deviation of the resulting vector is used to reject the points whose {greek small letter sigma} is higher than a given threshold . this process continues until the number of inliers remains unchanged. compared to the outlier removal method of , which uses kmeans clustering as a criterion to localise the outliers, this approach is deterministic and, unlike k-means, is not vulnerable to empty clusters. the outlier removal algorithm results in the green points labelled as the inliers in fig. 5-b and -d. the left and right pairs, which have the closest value of y to that of the nose tip are selected as l3 and l6. also, the points amongst the inliers in fig. 5-d, with the smallest depth values, are detected and the pair with the most similar distance to l4 are selected as the eye corners . the eye corners and nasal alar groove landmarks are the red points in fig. 5-b and -d, respectively.",

face dataset, with 557 subjects. the captures in the dataset were obtained using the minolta laser sensors over three different sets of sessions: spring 2003, fall 2003 and spring 2004 . the samples in the spring 2003 folders are known as the v1.0 , while the collection in the other two folders constitute v2.0. frgc v1.0 and v2.0 have 267 subjects and 466 subjects , respectively. to evaluate the

frgc's roc iii on exp iii . this is a verification scenario, which uses the between season 3d data samples. for this experiment, usually the equal error rate or 0.1% false accept rate is reported. the third evaluation using frgc is termed expression vs. expression. frgc consists of samples with neutral and non-neutral facial expressions, and using different sets of facial expressions for the probe samples enables neutral gallery vs. neutral probe and neutral gallery vs. non-neutral probe evaluations. the purpose of this experiment is to quantitatively evaluate how the performance of a face recognition system with a neutral gallery changes when the probe samples are replaced by non-neutral samples. the other two datasets used are the bosphorus 3d face dataset and the bu-3dfe dataset , which contain captures of six prototypic expressions in addition to neutral. bu-3dfe contains 100 subjects with age range 18 to 70 years. it contains four different levels of intensity of each facial expression and only one neutral sample per subject, making it one of the most challenging benchmarks for face recognition. for the bosphorus database, one neutral sample per subject is used in the gallery and the remaining 2797 samples as probes , . for both the bosphorus and bu-3dfe a specific expression robustness evaluation uses the neutral expression as the gallery and the captures for each expression in turn as probes , . b. landmarking consistency and accuracy the face recognition rates reported in the following subsections provide indirect evidence of the landmarking algorithm's consistency. however, to provide an independent assessment, the within-class similarity of the landmarking is investigated. in this evaluation, all subjects in the datasets are translated so that the nose tip is located at the origin. then, the mean of the positions of each landmark for each january 3, 2019 draft 18 0 5 10 15 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 distance detection accuracy left alar groove right

process is performed for all subjects in the dataset and the averages and standard deviations are calculated. for an ideal landmarking algorithm, the average for each landmark would be zero. however, due to the noise in the data and image acquisition errors, in practice the averages are non-zero. although frgc contains 557 subjects, some only have one sample and these are discarded, as it is impossible to compute the mean distance for such subjects. table i shows the results for the frgc and bosphorus datasets, when the rotation angles in for the nasal root and s {greek small letter phi} for the subnasale detection are maxm = beta = {greek small letter phi} = {greek small letter pi}/3 and the angles in and for the eye corners and nasal alar groove landmarks are {greek small letter eta} = - {greek small letter zeta} = {greek small letter pi}/4. the errors are higher for the frgc dataset as its samples are noisier, especially those in the spring 2003 folder. the most consistent pair of landmarks on both datasets are the two nasal alar , while the errors are slightly higher for the eye corners . the location of subnasale is more consistently detected for the samples of the bosphorus dataset. this is mainly due to the 3d reconstruction noise for the higher frequency regions, as is in subnasale, for the frgc samples. the other important factor for a landmarking algorithm is its accuracy and, in order to evaluate this, the locations of the landmarks are compared with the ground truth provided by the bosphorus dataset. first, the pca alignment matrix and {greek small letter theta}opt z are applied to the ground truth landmarks to remap the points to the aligned faces domain. the precision curve is then computed for the landmarks {l2, l3, l4, l6, l7}. as the location of nasal root has not been assigned by the dataset providers, it is excluded from the accuracy evaluations. the curves shown in fig. 8 are found over the action units samples and samples with neutral and non-neutral expressions in the bosphorus dataset , constituting 2803 samples. for the range of > 10 mm, all the landmarks are detected with {greater-than or equal to}95% accuracy. a comparison with the landmarking results reported by creusot et al. is shown in table ii. although the results january 3, 2019 draft 19 in are provided for different types of facial expressions, considering the number of samples and the recognition rates, they can be computed for all three action units, neutral and non-neutral samples in the bosphorus dataset. for the nasal alar and tip, the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy, in particular the accuracy for the nose tip is improved by 2%. however, for the eye corners, the algorithm in performs 2% better. although the proposed landmarking algorithm is not as robust as the approach of in the cases of partial and self-occlusions, it has the advantage of not requiring a training step. c. robustness against facial expressions this section explains the parameters used for the feature descriptors, gabor wavelets, the kfa and the ga optimiser. the supplementary material presents more extensive experiments that evaluate the effects of varying these parameters on the overall face recognition performance. feature descriptors and gabor wavelets: the radius of the spherical patches is 11 mm, while the numbers of histogram bins are 21 and 15 for the spherical and nasal curves, respectively. the gabor wavelets at each orientation and scale can be defined by the lower and higher frequency levels and the maximum number of orientation and scale levels . the parameter values used to obtain the results in the subsequent sections are: {ohm sign}l = 0.05, {ohm sign}h = 0.7, and om = sm = 4. for the gabor wavelet implementation the feature extraction and gabor filtering code is employed1. the supplementary material includes extensive results of the effects of the landmarking distribution for the spherical patches and gabor wavelets parameters on the face recognition ranks. kfa: the polynomial kernel x00xr gxr p {intercalate}+ k1 x01 {white bullet}k2 is applied to the sg *dr and sp*dr gallery and probe feature matrices xr g and xr p, respectively, where {white bullet}is the hadamard element-wise power operator. dr is the input feature space dimensionality, which is reduced to d after kfa is utilised . k1 and k2 are the scalar parameters of the kernel, set to 0 and 2.65, respectively. the kfa implementation is based on a modified version of the publicly available pretty helpful development functions for face recognition toolbox 2. ga: the modified nsga-ii algorithm used to perform the global optimisation to maximise stops when the variation in the stalled best fitness value is < 10-4, which is achieved after approximately 70,000 iterations for the curves and spherical patches. the population size is 15 times the number of variables, while the pareto and cross-over and migration fractions are 0.35, 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. 1http://old.vision.ece.ucsb.edu/texture/software/ 2luks.fe.uni-lj.si/sl/osebje/vitomir/face%5ftools/phdface/ january 3, 2019 draft 20 feature number of

the population and the phenotype distance crowding measurement is utilised to compute the individuals' distance measure. the code is implemented using matlab's global optimization toolbox3. 1) feature selection: the algorithm described in section vi is used to select the most discriminative patches and curves. for the feature selection stage, the neutral samples are employed for training and all the non-neutral samples for the test phase. the polynomial kernel is used for subspace projection. then, the mahalanobis cosine distance of is applied for the matching step at each iteration of the ga. in order to quantitatively illustrate how a subset of selected features can boost the recognition ranks, as an example, fig. 9 shows the face recognition ranks before and after applying the feature selection over the bosphorus dataset. over the first two ranks, the average improvement for both curves and patches is {almost equal to}1% . for all experiments presented in the following sections, different datasets are used for feature selection and testing, such that the test dataset is always completely unseen by the feature selector. either the bosphorus or the bu-3dfe dataset is used for feature selection, as these both have high variations in 3http://mathworks.com/help/gads/gamultiobj.html january 3, 2019 draft 21 their expression types. the bosphorus dataset is used for feature selection for all experiments in which frgc or bu-3dfe are the test datasets, while bu-3dfe is used for feature selection with the bosphorus dataset. 2) variable training size for frgc: to investigate the effects of using a different number of training samples per subject, the training size is increased from 1 to 7 for each subject in the frgc dataset and the r1rr computed for the selected patches and curves, see table iii. in this experiment, all the folders in frgc from different seasons are merged. then, for each subject, the number of samples in the gallery is changed and the average r1rr are reported after the samples are interchanged in the gallery and probe. the results show the high discrimination of the feature space for the spherical patches over the frgc dataset. for example, when only one sample per subject is used in the gallery , a r1rr of 96.2% is achieved. to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest 3d nasal region recognition rank ever obtained from this dataset for a single training sample and comparable with many state-of-the-art 3d face recognition algorithms, which use the whole facial domain. although the curves have lower r1rr for one training sample per subject, there is a big increase in their recognition performance when the samples per subject are increased. for instance, when 2 samples per subject are used in the gallery, the nasal curves r1rr performance increases by > 5%. 3) frgc v2.0 and roc iii: the recognition performance for the frgc v2.0 dataset and the roc iii experiment are widely used face recognition benchmarks. the dataset contains samples with different facial expressions for both the gallery and probe. the rank recognition performance shown in fig. 10-a increases with the rank to > 99% for the spherical patches. a similar trend exists for the cumulative matching characteristic curves increasing with a high gradient for all ranks > 1. the results of applying different patches and curves to this dataset are given in table iv. the table also compares the performance of the proposed approach with recently proposed 3d face recognition techniques that employ the nasal region and also the whole face. for the frgc v2.0 experiment, the spherical patches outperform the curves, with a r1rr of 97.9%. for this experiment, although only the nasal region is used, the recognition rates of the proposed algorithm recognition rates are higher than or very close to the results of state-of-the-art approaches, in which the whole facial surface is utilised , , , , , , , . the recognition performance of recent methods that only use the nasal region, for example , , , is at least 3% worse, and in some cases up to 6% lower. also, when the samples used in the probe set are changed from neutral to non-neutral, the proposed algorithm has the lowest variation in the r1rr for both curves and spherical patches 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 false accept rate : logarithmic

is even a slight increase in the recognition rates when non-neutral samples are used as probes , which shows how robustly the algorithm has learned the facial expressions. in comparison with the algorithm of li et al. , which also uses the normal vectors as the basis for its feature space, there is {almost equal to}1.5% improvement in the r1rr and nearly a 4% increase in r1rr when the non-neutral samples of frgc are used as the probes. roc iii curves are the frgc's cross-seasonal verification scenario and these are plotted in fig. 10-b using a logarithmic scale. the eer and 0.1%

algorithms that use the whole face, which show a higher robustness for the verification scenario. for example, the algorithms of , , , have lower identification performance than the proposed algorithm but a better verification performance. one conclusion from this may be that, for verification scenarios, the whole facial region might provide a higher confidence level when matched with a claimed identity. 4) robustness against different facial expressions: to more extensively evaluate the face recognition performance over different facial expressions the bu-3dfe and bosphorus datasets are

subject one expression type is selected for the gallery samples and another for the probe. the results are shown in table vi, where each column relates to a facial expression and the number of samples used in the probe set is given. the average recognition rank for the 76 subjects with more than one neutral sample per subject is reported for the neutral vs. neutral experiment, as shown in the last

the other hand, the feature space is most invariant for the surprise expressions, as 100% of the samples are correctly recognised for this probe set. the algorithm is compared with that of li et al. , in which similar evaluations are performed. the spherical patches show higher robustness, in particular for disgust , anger and fear , happy , sadness and surprise . the results reported in , however,

different intensity levels of each expression used as probes. table vii shows the r1rr for each expression type. as the expressions in the bu-3dfe dataset are significantly more intense than those in the bosphorus dataset, the recognition rates are lower than those in table vi. the spherical patches still provide the best r1rr performance for 5 of the 6 expression types, with an average r1rr of

    "Text": "to address the problem of expression invariant face recognition, a novel algorithm is introduced, that utilises the 3d shape of nose. the algorithm is based on a highly consistent and accurate landmarking algorithm, a robust feature space, discriminative feature descriptors and feature selectors. the proposed method is applied over three well-known face datasets, frgc, bu-3dfe and bosphorus. the matching results show that the algorithm is very successful for both the identification and verification scenarios, producing a r1rr of 97.9% on frgc v2.0, an eer of 2.4% on roc iii, and r1rr of 98.45% and 98.5% for neutral and non-neutral probes, respectively. the proposed method does not rely on sophisticated preprocessing algorithms for its denoising and alignment. in addition, when there is only one sample per subject in the gallery, for all the merged folders of the frgc dataset, a r1rr of 96.2% is obtained. for the bosphorus dataset a r1rr of 95.35% is obtained when one neutral sample per subject is used for gallery and the remaining samples with various expression types as probes. the results of the proposed method reveal the high potential of the nasal region for 3d face recognition. the recognition ranks are not only significantly higher than previous nasal region-based algorithms, but also have a better performance than many 3d holistic and multi-modal approaches. there are several aspects of the algorithm which can be utilised in other applications. for example, january 3, 2019 draft 26 the feature extraction step, which is based on histograms of gabor wavelet normals, can be applied to other 3d object recognition methods. also, the feature selection paradigm described here can be easily applied to other pattern recognition algorithms, to maximise the within-class and between-class similarity and dissimilarity, respectively, enabling the extraction of a lower dimensional and less redundant feature space. the application of the proposed landmarking algorithm can be investigated for performing facial alignment, low dimensional face recognition and pattern rejection. finally, the application of the feature extraction step on the whole facial region, to make it robust against occlusions is an interesting area of future research.",

evolving surfaces is determined by purely geometric quantities. for both flows, the mean curvature is involved in the evolution equations, while the willmore flow additionally depends upon gauss curvature. these flows have been studied by several authors for compact hypersurfaces. in this setting, existence, regularity, and qualitative behavior of solutions have been analyzed in for the surface di {latin small ligature ff}usion flow, and in for the willmore flow, to mention just a few publications. in this paper, we consider uniformly regular hypersurfaces. it should be emphasized that these surfaces may be non-compact. the concept of uniformly regular riemannian manifolds was introduced by amann and it contains the class of compact riemannian manifolds as a special case. the study of geometric flows on non-compact manifolds is an active research topic, both from the point of view of pde theory and in relation to its applications in geometry and topology. to the best of our knowledge, the current literature on the surface di {latin small ligature ff}usion and willmore flows for non-compact manifolds all concern surfaces defined over an infinite cylinder or entire

result we establish well-posedness for initial surfaces that are c1+ {greek small letter alpha} egular and parameterized over a uniformly regular hypersurface. moreover, we show that solutions instantaneously regularize and become smooth, and even analytic in case {greek capital letter sigma} is analytic. in order to obtain our results, we show that the pertinent underlying evolution equations can be formulated as parabolic quasilinear equations of fourth order over the reference surface {greek capital letter sigma}. our analysis relies on the theory of continuous maximal regularity and the results and techniques developed in . the results in theorem 4.3 and theorem 5.1 are new. however, we note that in case {greek capital letter sigma} is an infinitely long cylinder embedded in r3, an analogous result to theorem 4.3 was obtained in for the surface di {latin small ligature ff}usion flow. for the willmore flow, theorem 5.1 is also new even if {greek capital letter

sphere is shown for surfaces that are c1+ {greek small letter alpha}-close to a sphere, also seems to be new. a corresponding result was obtained in for surfaces close to a sphere in the c2+ {greek small letter alpha}-topology. the authors in showed the existence of a lower bound on the lifespan of a smooth solution, which depends only on how much the curvature of the initial surface is concentrated in space. in , the authors proved convergence to round spheres under suitable smallness assumptions on the total energy of the surface. here we note that the energy used in involves second-order derivatives, whereas we only need smallness in the c1+ {greek small letter alpha}-topology. in particular, we obtain global existence and convergence for non-convex initial surfaces. the organization of the paper is as follows: in sections 2.1 and 2.2, we introduce the concept of uniformly regular manifolds and define the function spaces used in this paper. in sections 2.3 and 2.4, we review continuous maximal regularity theory and its applications to quasilinear parabolic equations with singular nonlinearity. these results form the theoretic basis for the study of the surface di {latin small ligature ff}usion and willmore flows. in section 3, we introduce the concept of uniformly regular hypersurfaces with a uniform tubular neighborhood -hypersurfaces) and work out several examples. we utilize these concepts to parameterize the evolving hypersurfaces driven by surface di {latin small ligature ff}usion and willmore flows as normal graphs over a reference hypersurface. in section 4, we establish our main results regarding existence, uniqueness, regularity, and semiflow properties for solutions to the surface di {latin small ligature ff}usion flow over hypersurfaces in rm+1. in section 5, we likewise establish well-posedness properties for solutions to the willmore flow over -hypersurfaces in r3. additionally, we show stability of euclidean spheres under perturbations in the c1+ {greek small letter alpha}-topology. we conclude the paper with an appendix where we state and prove some additional properties of normal graphs over -hypersurfaces. notation:

    "Text": "2.1. uniformly regular manifolds. the concept of uniformly regular manifolds was introduced by h. amann in and . loosely speaking, an m-dimensional riemannian manifold is uniformly regular if its di {latin small ligature ff}erentiable structure is induced by an atlas such that all its local patches are of approximately the same size, all derivatives of the transition maps are bounded, and the pull-back metric of g in every local coordinate is comparable to the euclidean metric gm. we will now state some structural properties of uniformly regular manifolds which will be used in the analysis of the the surface di {latin small ligature ff}usion flow and the willmore flow in subsequent sections. an oriented c {infinity}-manifold of dimension m and without boundary is uniformly regular if it admits an orientation-preserving atlas a := { : {greek small letter kappa} belong to k}, with a countable index set k, satisfying the following conditions. there exists k belong to n such that any intersection of more than k coordinate patches is empty. {greek phi symbol} {greek small letter kappa} = bm, where bm is the unit euclidean ball centered at the origin in rm. moreover, a is uniformly shrinkable; by which we mean that there exists some r belong to such that { {greek small letter psi} {greek small letter kappa} : {greek small letter kappa} belong to k} forms

regular i {latin small ligature ff}it is of bounded geometry, i.e. it is geodesically complete, of positive injectivity radius and all covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor are bounded. in particular, every compact manifold without boundary is uniformly regular and the manifolds considered in are all uniformly regular. given {greek small letter sigma}, {greek small letter tau} belong to

sections of t {greek small letter sigma} {greek small letter tau} m. throughout the rest of this paper, we will adopt the following convention. {bullet} p always denotes a point on a uniformly regular

{greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma} is the normal unit vector field compatible with the orientation of {greek capital letter sigma}. we refer to ua as the tubular neighborhood of {greek capital letter sigma} of width 2a and note that ua = {x belong to rm+1 : dist < a}. finally, we say that {greek capital letter sigma} has a tubular neighborhood if there exists a number a > 0 such that the above property holds. remarks 3.1. we lose no generality in assuming {greek capital letter sigma} is oriented, as any smooth embedded hypersurface without boundary is orientable, cf. . any smooth compact embedded hypersurface without boundary has a tubular neighborhood, see for instance . suppose {greek capital letter sigma} is a smooth embedded hypersurface with unit normal field {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma}. then {greek capital letter sigma} is said to satisfy the uniform ball condition of radius a > 0 if at each point p belong to {greek capital letter

letter sigma} satisfies the uniform ball condition of radius a. for the reader's convenience, we include a proof of this equivalence. proof. {rightwards double arrow}. suppose there exists p belong to {greek capital letter sigma} such that b {intersection} {greek capital letter sigma} {combining long solidus overlay}= {empty set}, where x0 := p + a {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma}. then s := dist {intersection} {greek capital letter sigma}) < a and there exists q belong to {macron} b {intersection} {greek capital letter sigma} such that x0 = q + s {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma}. hence x0 = x = x, with {combining long solidus overlay}= , contradicting the assumption that x is bijective. the case x0 = p -a {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma} is treated in the same way. {rightwards double arrow}. we only need to prove the injectivity of x. suppose, by contradiction, that x = x = x for {combining long solidus overlay}= . without loss of generality we may assume that r1 belong to , as we can otherwise replace {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma} by - {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma}. moreover, we may assume that |r2| {less-than or equal to}r1. let s belong to and set y := x = x + {greek small letter nu} {greek capital letter sigma}. 8 j. lecrone, y. shao, and g. simonett then we have |y -p2| {less-than or equal to}|y -x| + |x -p2| = s -r1 + |r2| {less-than or equal to}s, showing that p2 belong to {macron} b = {macron} b, s) {subset of}b, a). therefore, b, a) {intersection} {greek capital letter sigma} {combining long solidus overlay}= {empty set}, contradicting the assumption in . {white square} suppose {greek capital letter sigma} has a tubular neighborhood of radius a. let { {greek small letter kappa}1, . . . , {greek small letter kappa}m} be the principal curvatures of {greek capital letter sigma}, and l {greek capital letter sigma} the weingarten tensor. then it follows from part that | {greek small letter kappa}1|, . . . , | {greek small letter kappa}m| {less-than or equal to}1/a and |l {greek capital letter sigma}| {less-than or equal to}1/a. in the following, we say that {greek capital letter sigma} is a -hypersurface in rm+1 if {greek capital letter sigma} is a smooth oriented hypersurface without boundary embedded in rm+1. is uniformly regular, where g = gm+1| {greek capital letter sigma} denotes the metric induced by the euclidean metric gm+1. {greek capital letter sigma} has a tubular neighborhood. examples 3.2. every smooth compact hypersurface without boundary embedded in rm+1 is a -hypersurface. all of the manifolds considered in are -hypersurfaces. in particular, the infinite cylinder with radius r > 0, cr = { belong to r3 : y2 + z2 = r2, x belong to r}, is a -hypersurface with tubular neighborhood of radius a = r. assume that f : rm {rightwards arrow}r belongs to bc2. then the graph of f has a tubular neighborhood of radius a for some a > 0. proof. by the inverse function theorem, there exist uniform constants {greek small letter eta} > 0 and {greek small letter epsilon} > 0 such that, at every point x belong to rm, f|bm can be expressed as the graph of a bc2-function hx over txgr, the tangent space to the graph of f at the point ), such that the set {) : y belong to btxgr} is contained in {) : z belong to bm}. moreover, there exists a uniform constant c, independent of x, such that {parallel to}hx {parallel to}2, {infinity} {less-than or equal to}c where the supremum is taken over the ball btxgr. we refer to the proof of claim 1 in proposition a.1 in the appendix for a more general situation. further, we have hx = 0 and {nabla}hx = 0. due to , after taylor expansion of hx around 0 belong to txgr, we have |hx| {less-than or equal to} {parallel to} {nabla}2 yhx {parallel to} {infinity}|y|2, y belong to btxgr, for su {latin small ligature ffi}ciently small {greek small letter epsilon}. choosing c {greater-than or equal to} {parallel to} {nabla}2 yhx {parallel to} {infinity}such that 1/2c {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter epsilon}, we define a := 1/2c. it follows that the ball bm+1 lies above the graph {) : y belong to txgr}, where {greek small letter nu}x is the upwards pointing unit normal of gr at the point ). an analogous argument shows that the ball bm+1 lies below the graph. since the constants {greek small letter epsilon} and a are independent of x, combining with remark 3.1, this proves that gr has a tubular neighborhood of radius a. {white square} sdf and wf for uniformly regular surfaces 9 we refer to for additional examples of uniformly regular manifolds. in particular, embedded hypersurfaces with tame ends, considered in , are -hypersurfaces. more precisely, given a compact hypersurface without boundary b, embedded in rm, and 0 {less-than or equal to} {greek small letter alpha} {less-than or equal to}1, we define f {greek small letter alpha} := { : t > 1, y belong to b}, which we endow with the metric gf {greek small letter alpha} induced by its embedding into rm+1. an embedded hypersurface {greek capital letter sigma} {subset of}rm+1 is said to have tame ends if {greek capital letter sigma} = v0 {union} n [ i=1 vi, where is compact and is isometric to , gf {greek small letter alpha}). then, is a -hypersurface. in particular, when {greek small letter alpha} = 0, has finitely many cylinder ends; when {greek small letter alpha} = 1, has finitely many cone ends. let ck = { belong to r3 : y2 + z2 = 1 + 1/k, x belong to r}, k belong to n. based on part , the manifold {greek capital letter sigma} = s k ck, endowed with the metric induced by g3, is uniformly regular. but it is obvious that does not have a tubular neighborhood. there also exist connected uniformly regular hypersurfaces that are not . for instance, we can construct a smooth connected curve c in { : y > 0} such that c {intersection}{ : x {greater-than or equal to}0} is compact and c {intersection}{ : x < 0} = { : y = 1} {union}{ : y = 1 + ex}. then is a uniformly regular hypersurface that is not . one can take the product of c with rm to produce higher dimensional examples. additionally, one can rotate the curve c around the x-axis to obtain a connected rotationally symmetric uniformly regular hypersurface which is not .",

{greek capital letter sigma} via height functions {greek small letter rho} : {greek capital letter sigma} {rightwards arrow}r. assuming that {greek capital letter sigma} has a tubular neighborhood ua of radius a > 0, we recall that e {micro sign} = bc1+ {greek small letter alpha} and e {greek small letter gamma} = bc3+ {greek small letter alpha} are interpolation spaces between e0 := bc {greek

confirm this local expression for q, we first note that all third-order derivatives of {greek small letter rho} appear in f, while the terms 2 betah3 {greek small letter rho} and 2 betah {greek small letter rho}k {greek small letter rho} depend only on up to second-order derivatives. with the structure for f already established in , it su {latin small ligature ffi}ces to confirm that q only

derivatives of {greek small letter rho} and h {greek small letter rho} depends linearly on second-order derivatives, we see that at most cubic powers of {partial differential}2 {greek small letter

derived in . here lij are the components of the pull-back of the second fundamental form of {greek capital letter gamma} {greek small letter rho}. it follows from that lij = beta n {partial

    "Text": "the aim of our research project is to come up with an image processing algorithm that will let us cover the university of bridgeport parking lot, and this can be done by taking successive images and then combining these images into one large image. to have images with overlapped areas so that they can be combined, we needed a stable device with a good quality camera, which will capture the images in a certain order. that's why we chose the ar-drone 2.0. the ar-drone operator can directly set its yaw, pitch, roll, and vertical speed, and the control board adjusts the motor speeds to stabilize the drone at the required pose. the first camera with approximately 75 {degree sign} * 60 {degree sign} field of view is aimed forward and provides a 640 * 480 pixel color image. the second one is mounted on the bottom and provides color image with 176 * 144 pixels and its field of view is approximately 45 {degree sign} * 35 {degree sign}. therefore, the front camera of the drone will provide us with good quality stabilized overlapped images which can be combined into one image using the algorithm that we developed. along with the ar-drone 2.0, we also used existed free software libraries that we found helpful to develop our algorithm. the libraries are opencv and boofcv. opencv is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. the library has many optimized algorithms, which can be used in many areas such as face recognition, identifying objects, tracking moving objects, and stitching images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene. opencv also leans mostly towards real-time vision applications and it has many available interfaces . according to all of these properties, we used the java interface of opencv, which is a primary component of our algorithm. in addition to opencv and all the image processing features it has, boofcv has also demonstrated very high-level image processing capabilities. boofcv is a java library for realtime computer vision and robotics applications. it includes low-level image processing routines, feature tracking, and geometric computer vision. boofcv is organized into several packages: image processing, geometric vision, calibration, recognition, and visualization. the library has also an example for an image stitching algorithm, which is the main goal of our research project. image stitching refers to combining two or more overlapping images together into a single large image. when stitching images together, the goal is to find a 2d geometric transform which minimizes the error in overlapping regions. there are many ways to do this. boofcv uses an example where point image features are found, associated, and then a 2d transform is found robustly using the associated features. 2 another way to achieve image stitching is by the scale invariant feature transform algorithm. according to andrea vedaldi, a sift feature is a selected image region with an associated descriptor. additionally, there's another image stitching technique on which our algorithm is based on. this technique is called speeded up robust features . the surf and sift techniques are very similar but they have a few minor di {latin small ligature ff}erences in some details. the main concept of our image stitching algorithm is based on the opencv library as well as the surf algorithm, which gave us the results that we almost were aiming for.",

        "Text": "the boofcv library has its own image stitching algorithm. this algorithm, finds some image points features and then a 2d transform is found robustly using the associated features. this image stitching algorithm can be summarized as follows: first, detect and describe point features, which is the discovery of the best key points of each image. then associate features together, only with the common key points between the images. after that, apply a robust fitting to find a transform that will make the necessary changes in the images, such as rotations. the final step is to render the combined images to generate the final image. figure 2: boofcv algorithm steps once boofcv renders two images together, it generates a single image with a black background to complete the square referring to the image file itself. after that, when we try to stitch this result with a third image, we will not get the desired result. this happens because the black background will be considered as a part of the image, so the algorithm will try to find a correspondence between the background and some features of the third image and will not find the correct correlation between the images. even if we use some techniques to cut o {latin small ligature ff}the background, the result will still present distortions. this will happen because of the translations that boofcv does. these translations change the rectangular shape of the image, so there will always be some black background. thus, the result of stitching more than two images using boofcv will be a very distorted image. to avoid this problem, we decided to implement our own algorithm, using opencv.",

        "Text": "our stitching algorithm was developed based on the opencv library and mostly prepared using the image processing technique surf. to perform the main feature of our algorithm, the key point detection using surf is our first and main step. according to herbert bay, the surf algorithm is a local feature detector and descriptor that can be used for tasks such as object recognition or registration or classification or 3d reconstruction. it is partly inspired by the scale-invariant feature transform descriptor. the surf algorithm is based on the same principles and steps as the sift, but details in each step are di {latin small ligature ff}erent. the algorithm has three main parts: interest point detection, local neighborhood 4 description and matching. surf uses a blob detector based on the hessian matrix to find points of interest. the determinant of the hessian matrix is used as a measure of local change around the point and points are chosen where this determinant is maximal. figure 3: key points and feature detection from two consecutive images after identifying the key points and matching them between the images, we must identify the common area between these images and crop it. intersection in the first input intersection in the second input figure 4: intersections in the input images figure 5: new first image without the intersection now, the first image has only the part that is not included in the second image. we always keep the last image for performance and level details. the next step is simply to blend those two images together; the first in the bottom and the second in the top. the result of this rendering will be the first input to the algorithm followed by the pictures taken when the drone moves forward. 5 figure 6: final image after the stitch algorithm",

    "Text": "we took three pictures , 7 and 7) with the front camera of the drone and cut them to feed the algorithm. we were able to get two satisfactory results, even though they have very visible di {latin small ligature ff}erences, as shown in figure 7 and figure 7. image 1 image 2 image 3 figure 7: results the stitching algorithm provided by the boofcv library does not have a complete rectangular image because it rotates the images for a better binding, which means that the image will have gaps that will be filled by a black background, as shown in figure 8. on the other hand, the algorithm implemented by us simply binds the images together without any gaps and black backgrounds, as shown in figure 8. boofcv result stitched images figure 8: boofcv vs our results it is clear that the boofcv algorithm binds two images with more precision than our implementation, and we barely see the transition between these two images, but it will present a lot of distortions as soon as we attempt to stitch a higher number of images. this distortion 6 makes it di {latin small ligature ffi}cult to bind more images because increasing the amount of images will increase the amount of distortions, which will decrease the quality the results. however, our algorithm will not present distortions, but it will have clear lines of transitions between the bound images. since some details of the images can get lost during this process, this will also a {latin small ligature ff}ect the quality of the results. therefore, classifying which algorithm works better for this problem is a di {latin small ligature ffi}cult decision.",

    "Section": "5 Conclusion",
    "Text": "after running some examples, we decided that, the best approach for creating a bigger image from other small images is the algorithm developed by us. even though boofcv can fit two images with better accuracy, the drone mapping will have a large number of images to stitch, and boofcv's results would be impracticable because of the amount of distortion it presents. thus, the algorithm developed by us is a good candidate for the proposed task. at the end of this project, we could not reach the goal of mapping the parking lot. working with image stitching algorithms requires very high quality images, which unfortunately the ar-drone 2.0 does not provide to us. one good possibility for completing this task is using the new version of it, or even using some di {latin small ligature ff}erent drone, with preferentially a 1080p camera. another problem while dealing with the use of drones for this project is the low stability of the drone. because of external environment, the pictures taken by the drone were often without a common area, so the algorithm did not perform as expected. thus, the best drone to be used in such project is one with not only a high quality camera, but also with a good stability. with the e {latin small ligature ffi}cient resources, a parking lot mapping can be done, and it can be used to create a very reliable vigilance system.",
